Debris Disk Radiative Transfer Simulation Tool (DDS),"A WWW interface for the simulation of spectral energy distributions of
optically thin dust configurations with an embedded radiative source is
presented. The density distribution, radiative source, and dust parameters can
be selected either from an internal database or defined by the user. This tool
is optimized for studying circumstellar debris disks where large grains are
expected to determine the far-infrared through millimeter dust reemission
spectral energy distribution. The tool is available at

Neutron star matter equation of state and gravitational wave emission,"The EOS of strongly interacting matter at densities ten to fifteen orders of
magnitude larger than the typical density of terrestrial macroscopic objects
determines a number of neutron star properties, including the pattern of
gravitational waves emitted following the excitation of nonradial oscillation
modes. This paper reviews some of the approaches employed to model neutron star
matter, as well as the prospects for obtaining new insights from the
experimental study of gravitational waves emitted by neutron stars.",2005-07-21T07:55:50Z
Testing the Friedmannian magnitude-redshift relation with SNIa data,"Standard cosmology is constructed upon the (generally implicit) assumption of
the ``large scale'' homogeneity of our Universe. Now, structures are observed
at scales which become larger and larger as the observational distances
increase. However, the homogeneous Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model
remains a cosmological paradigm, and Friedmannian relations are usually used to
work out the model, implicitly assuming that the homogeneity assumption is
valid at the studied scales. This has been the way the concordance (Lambda-CDM)
model came out from the analyses of the SNIa data. Since this model implies the
validity of the Friedmannian magnitude-redshift relation at the range of
redshifts spaned by the supernovae surveys, it has been proposed some years ago
a very simple test of this possible validity, provided the SNIa should be
confirmed as standard candles. Since we can hope that the redshifts of the
supernovae which will be observed in the years to come will allow such a test
to be performed, it would be interesting to find inside the SNIa community some
collaborators ready to perform the test.",2005-04-21T16:39:38Z
A helium spread among the main sequence stars in NGC 2808,"We studied the color distribution of the main sequence of the Globular
Cluster NGC 2808, based on new deep HST-WFPC2 photometry of a field in the
uncrowded outskirts of the cluster. The color distribution of main sequence
stars is wider than expected for a single stellar population, given our
(carefully determined) measurement errors. About 20% of the sample stars are
much bluer than expected and are most plausibly explained as a population
having a much larger helium abundance than the bulk of the main sequence. We
estimate that the helium mass fraction of these stars is Y ~ 0.4. NGC 2808 may
have suffered self-enrichment, with different stellar populations born from the
ejecta of the intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of the
first generation. In addition to the Y=0.40 stars, roughly 30% of the stars
should have Y distributed between 0.26-0.29 while 50% have primordial Y, to
explain also the peculiar horizontal branch morphology. Three main stages of
star formation are identified, the first with primordial helium content Y ~
0.24, the second one born from the winds of the most massive AGBs of the first
stellar generation (6-7msun), having Y ~ 0.4, and a third one born from the
matter ejected from less massive AGBs (~ 3.5-4.5msun) with Y ~ 0.26-0.29. For a
long hiatus of time (several 10^7yr) between the second and third generation,
star formation might have been inhibited by the explosion of late Supernovae II
deriving from binary evolution.",2005-05-17T14:15:15Z
A universal velocity distribution of relaxed collisionless structures,"Several general trends have been identified for equilibrated,
self-gravitating collisionless systems, such as density or anisotropy profiles.
These are integrated quantities which naturally depend on the underlying
velocity distribution function (VDF) of the system. We study this VDF through a
set of numerical simulations, which allow us to extract both the radial and the
tangential VDF. We find that the shape of the VDF is universal, in the sense
that it depends only on two things namely the dispersion (radial or tangential)
and the local slope of the density. Both the radial and the tangential VDF's
are universal for a collection of simulations, including controlled collisions
with very different initial conditions, radial infall simulation, and
structures formed in cosmological simulations.",2005-05-19T20:00:11Z
"Scalar Field Models: From the Pioneer Anomaly to Astrophysical
  Constraints","In this work we study how scalar fields may affect solar observables, and use
the constraint on the Sun's central temperature to extract bounds on the
parameters of relevant models. Also, a scalar field driven by a suitable
potential is shown to produce an anomalous acceleration similar to the one
found in the Pioneer anomaly.",2005-05-17T00:25:38Z
Nonlinear Evolution of the Magnetothermal Instability in Two Dimensions,"In weakly magnetized, dilute plasmas in which thermal conduction along
magnetic field lines is important, the usual convective stability criterion is
modified. Instead of depending on entropy gradients, instability occurs for
small wavenumbers when (dP/dz)(dln T/dz) > 0, which we refer to as the Balbus
criterion. We refer to the convective instability that results in this regime
as the magnetothermal instability (MTI). We use numerical MHD simulations which
include anisotropic electron heat conduction to follow the growth and
saturation of the MTI in two-dimensional, plane parallel atmospheres that are
unstable according to the Balbus criterion. The linear growth rates measured in
the simulations agree with the weak field dispersion relation. We investigate
the effect of strong fields and isotropic conduction on the linear properties
and nonlinear regime of the MTI. In the nonlinear regime, the instability
saturates and convection decays away, when the atmosphere becomes isothermal.
Sustained convective turbulence can be driven if there is a fixed temperature
difference between the top and bottom edges of the simulation domain, and if
isotropic conduction is used to create convectively stable layers that prevent
the formation of unresolved, thermal boundary layers. The largest component of
the time-averaged heat flux is due to advective motions. These results have
implications for a variety of astrophysical systems, such as the temperature
profile of hot gas in galaxy clusters, and the structure of radiatively
inefficient accretion flows.",2005-07-08T16:43:52Z
"XBootes: An X-Ray Survey of the NDWFS Bootes Field - Paper I Overview
  and Initial Results","We obtained a 5 ksec deep Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-I map of the 9.3
square degree Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. Here we describe
the data acquisition and analysis strategies leading to a catalog of 4642
(3293) point sources with 2 or more (4 or more) counts, corresponding to a
limiting flux of roughly 4(8)x10^{-15} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1} in the 0.5-7 keV band.
These Chandra XBootes data are unique in that they consitute the widest
contiguous X-ray field yet observed to such a faint flux limit. Because of the
extraordinarily low background of the ACIS, we expect only 14% (0.7%) of the
sources to be spurious. We also detected 43 extended sources in this survey.
The distribution of the point sources among the 126 pointings (ACIS-I has a 16
x 16 arcminute field of view) is consistent with Poisson fluctuations about the
mean of 36.8 sources per pointing. While a smoothed image of the point source
distribution is clumpy, there is no statistically significant evidence of large
scale filamentary structure. We do find however, that for theta>1 arcminute,
the angular correlation function of these sources is consistent with previous
measurements, following a power law in angle with slope -0.7. In a 1.4 deg^{2}
sample of the survey, approximately 87% of the sources with 4 or more counts
have an optical counterpart to R ~26 mag. As part of a larger program of
optical spectroscopy of the NDWFS Bootes area, spectra have been obtained for
\~900 of the X-ray sources, most of which are QSOs or AGN.",2005-04-04T21:17:44Z
Imaging redshifts of BL Lac objects,"The HST snapshot imaging survey of 110 BL Lac objects (Urry et al. 2000) has
clearly shown that the host galaxies are massive and luminous ellipticals. The
dispersion of the absolute magnitudes is sufficiently small, so that the
measurement of the galaxy brightness becomes a valuable way of estimating their
distance. This is illustrated constructing the Hubble diagram of the 64
resolved objects with known redshift. By means of this relationship we estimate
the redshift of five resolved BL Lacs of the survey, which have no
spectroscopic z. The adopted method allows us also to evaluate lower limits to
the redshift for 13 objects of still unknown z, based on the lower limit on the
host galaxy magnitude. This technique can be applied to any BL Lac object for
which an estimate or a lower limit of the host galaxy magnitude is available.
Finally we show that the distribution of the nuclear luminosity of all the BL
Lacs of the survey, indicates that the objects for which both the redshift and
the host galaxy are undetected, are among the most luminous, and possibly the
most highly beamed.",2005-08-09T10:20:19Z
"The chemistry of fluorine-bearing molecules in diffuse and dense
  interstellar gas clouds","We present a theoretical investigation of the chemistry of fluorine-bearing
molecules in diffuse and dense interstellar gas clouds. The chemistry of
interstellar fluorine is qualitatively different from that of any other
element, because - unlike the neutral atoms of any other element found in
diffuse or dense molecular clouds - atomic fluorine undergoes an exothermic
reaction with molecular hydrogen. Over a wide range of conditions attained
within interstellar gas clouds, the product of that reaction - hydrogen
fluoride - is predicted to be the dominant gas-phase reservoir of interstellar
fluorine nuclei. Our model predicts HF column densities ~ 1.E+13 cm-2 in dark
clouds and column densities as large as 1.E-11 cm-2 in diffuse interstellar gas
clouds with total visual extinctions as small as 0.1 mag. Such diffuse clouds
will be detectable by means of absorption line spectroscopy of the J = 1 - 0
transition at 243.2 micron using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA) and the Herschel Space Observatory (HSO). The CF+ ion is
predicted to be the second most abundant fluorine-bearing molecule, with
typical column densities a factor ~ 100 below those of HF; with its lowest two
rotational transitions in the millimeter-wave spectral region, CF+ may be
detectable from ground-based observatories. HF absorption in quasar spectra is
a potential probe of molecular gas at high redshift, providing a possible
bridge between the UV/optical observations capable of probing H2 in low column
density systems and the radio/millimeter-wavelength observations that probe
intervening molecular clouds of high extinction and large molecular fraction;
at redshifts beyond ~ 0.3, HF is potentially detectable from ground-based
submillimeter observatories in several atmospheric transmission windows.",2005-04-13T19:44:03Z
"Testing homogeneity on large scales in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
  Release One","The assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales
is one of the fundamental postulates of cosmology. We have tested the large
scale homogeneity of the galaxy distribution in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release One (SDSS-DR1) using volume limited subsamples extracted from the
two equatorial strips which are nearly two dimensional (2D). The galaxy
distribution was projected on the equatorial plane and we carried out a 2D
multi-fractal analysis by counting the number of galaxies inside circles of
different radii in the range 5 Mpc/h to 150 Mpc/h centred on galaxies.
Different moments of the count-in-cells were analysed to identify a range of
length-scales (60-70 Mpc/h to 150Mpc/h) where the moments show a power law
scaling behaviour and to determine the scaling exponent which gives the
spectrum of generalised dimension D_q. If the galaxy distribution is
homogeneous, D_q does not vary with q and is equal to the Euclidean dimension
which in our case is 2. We find that D_q varies in the range 1.7 to 2.2. We
also constructed mock data from random, homogeneous point distributions and
from LCDM N-body simulations with bias b=1, 1.6 and 2, and analysed these in
exactly the same way. The values of D_q in the random distribution and the
unbiased simulations show much smaller variations and these are not consistent
with the actual data. The biased simulations, however, show larger variations
in D_q and these are consistent with both the random and the actual data.
Interpreting the actual data as a realisation of a biased LCDM universe, we
conclude that the galaxy distribution is homogeneous on scales larger than
60-70 Mpc/h.",2005-04-14T04:56:19Z
"The N2K Consortium. II. A Transiting Hot Saturn Around HD 149026 With a
  Large Dense Core","Doppler measurements from Subaru and Keck have revealed radial velocity
variations in the V=8.15, G0IV star HD 149026 consistent with a Saturn-Mass
planet in a 2.8766 day orbit. Photometric observations at Fairborn Observatory
have detected three complete transit events with depths of 0.003 mag at the
predicted times of conjunction. HD 149026 is now the second brightest star with
a transiting extrasolar planet. The mass of the star, based on interpolation of
stellar evolutionary models, is 1.3 +/- 0.1 solar masses; together with the
Doppler amplitude, K=43.3 m s^-1, we derive a planet mass Msin(i)=0.36 Mjup,
and orbital radius of 0.042 AU. HD 149026 is chromospherically inactive and
metal-rich with spectroscopically derived [Fe/H]=+0.36, Teff=6147 K, log g=4.26
and vsin(i)=6.0 km s^-1. Based on Teff and the stellar luminosity of 2.72 Lsun,
we derive a stellar radius of 1.45 Rsun. Modeling of the three photometric
transits provides an orbital inclination of 85.3 +/- 1.0 degrees and (including
the uncertainty in the stellar radius) a planet radius of 0.725 +/- 0.05 Rjup.
Models for this planet mass and radius suggest the presence of a ~67 Mearth
core composed of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. This substantial
planet core would be difficult to construct by gravitational instability.",2005-06-30T23:26:10Z
"XMM-Newton observations of the Lockman Hole IV: spectra of the brightest
  AGN","This paper presents the results of a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of a
sample of 123 X-ray sources (46 being type-1 AGN and 28 type-2 AGN) detected
with XMM-Newton in the Lockman Hole field. Using a single power law model our
sources' average spectral slope hardens at faint 0.5-2 keV fluxes but not at
faint 2-10 keV fluxes. We explain the effect in terms of an increase in X-ray
absorption at faint fluxes. The average spectral slope of our sources is ~1.9
with an intrinsic dispersion of ~0.28. We detected X-ray absorption in 37% of
the sources, ~10% in type-1 AGN and ~77% in type-2 AGN. Using X-ray fluxes
corrected for absorption, the fraction of absorbed objects and the absorbing
column density distribution did not vary with X-ray flux. Our type-1 and type-2
AGN do not appear to have different continuum shapes, but the distribution of
intrinsic absorption is different among both classes. A significant fraction of
our type-2 AGN (5 out of 28) were found to display no substantial absorption.
We discuss possible interpretations to this in terms of Compton-thick AGN and
intrinsic Broad Line Region properties. An emission line compatible with Fe
Kalpha was detected in 8 sources with rest frame equivalent widths 120-1000 eV.
The AGN continuum or intrinsic absorption did not depend on X-ray luminosity
and/or redshift. Soft excess emission was detected in 18 objects, but only in 9
could we fit this spectral component with a black body model. The 0.5-2 keV
luminosities of the fitted black body were not significantly different in
type-1 and type-2 AGN, although the temperatures were slightly higher in type-2
AGN than in type-1 AGN. For 9 sources (including 1 type-1 AGN and 3 type-2 AGN)
a scattering model provided a better fit of the soft excess emission.",2005-06-29T10:20:18Z
"High resolution numerical modeling of the force-free pulsar
  magnetosphere","We consider the force-free magnetosphere of an aligned rotator. Its structure
is well described by a Grad-Shafranov equation for poloidal magnetic field, the
so-called ""pulsar equation"". We solve this equation by a multigrid method with
high numerical resolution. On the fine numerical grid current layer along the
last closed field line could be accurately incorporated into the numerical
procedure and all physical properties of the solution such as Goldreich-Julian
charge density, drift velocity, energy losses etc. could be accurately
calculated. Here we report results of the simulations. Among other interesting
properties, the solution is not unique, i.e. the position of the last closed
field line, and hence the pulsar energy losses, are not determined by the
global magnetosphere structure and depend on kinetic of electromagnetic
cascades. We discuss the properties of the solutions and their implications for
pulsars. A model for pulsar magnetosphere evolution is proposed. In the frame
of this model values of the pulsar braking index less than 3 have natural
explanation.",2005-07-03T20:26:48Z
"A photometric study of V1193 Ori: detection of orbital and negative
  superhump periods","We present the results obtained from unfiltered photometric CCD observations
of V1193 Ori made during 24 nights between November 2002 and January 2003. We
found periods of 0.1430 d, 0.1362 d and possibly 2.98 d in the data. The 0.1430
d period is consistent with the 1d^{-1} alias of the proposed orbital period of
P_{orb}=0.165 d (Ringwald et al., 1994, Papadaki et al., 2004). Thus and using
the known relation between the orbital and superhump periods, we interpret
these periods as the orbital period of 0.1430 d, the negative superhump period
of 0.1362 d and the precession period of 2.98 d. V1193 Ori can then be
classified as a permanent superhump system.",2005-07-05T07:03:53Z
Asphericity and clumpiness in the winds of Luminous Blue Variables,"We present the first systematic spectropolarimetric study of Luminous Blue
Variables (LBVs) in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, in order to
investigate the geometries of their winds. We find that at least half of our
sample show changes in polarization across the strong H$\alpha$ emission line,
indicating that the light from the stars is intrinsically polarized and
therefore that asphericity already exists at the base of the wind. Multi-epoch
spectropolarimetry on four targets reveals variability in their intrinsic
polarization. Three of these, AG Car, HR Car and P Cyg, show a position angle
(PA) of polarization which appears random with time. Such behaviour can be
explained by the presence of strong wind-inhomogeneities, or `clumps' within
the wind. Only one star, R 127, shows variability at a constant PA, and hence
evidence for axi-symmetry as well as clumpiness. However, if viewed at low
inclination, and at limited temporal sampling, such a wind would produce a
seemingly random polarization of the type observed in the other three stars.
Time-resolved spectropolarimetric monitoring of LBVs is therefore required to
determine if LBV winds are axi-symmetric in general.
  The high fraction of LBVs ($>$ 50%) showing intrinsic polarization is to be
compared with the lower $\sim$ 20-25 % for similar studies of their
evolutionary neighbours, O supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars. We anticipate that
this higher incidence is due to the lower effective gravities of the LBVs,
coupled with their variable temperatures within the bi-stability jump regime.
This is also consistent with the higher incidence of wind asphericity that we
find in LBVs with strong H$\alpha$ emission and recent (last $\sim$ 10 years)
strong variability.",2005-05-17T12:22:14Z
"Photodissociation of water in crystalline ice: a molecular dynamics
  study","Ultraviolet irradiation of ice is of great interest for understanding the
chemistry in both atmospheric and astrophysical environments. In interstellar
space, photodissociation of H2O molecules can be a driving force behind the
chemistry on icy dust grains in dense, cold molecular clouds even though the
flux of UV photons is extremely low. The mechanisms of such photoinduced
processes are poorly understood, however. In this work the photodissociation
dynamics of a water molecule in crystalline ice at 10 K is studied
computationally using classical molecular dynamics. Photodissociation in the
first bilayer leads mainly to H atoms desorbing (65%), while in the third
bilayer trapping of H and OH dominates (51%). The kinetic energy distribution
of the desorbing H atoms is much broader than that for the corresponding
gas-phase photodissociation. The H atoms on average move 11 Angstroms before
becoming trapped, while OH radicals typically move 2 Angstroms. In accordance
with experiments a blueshift of the absorption spectrum is obtained relative to
gas-phase water.",2005-05-31T12:36:55Z
"The X-ray Spectral Properties and Variability of Luminous High-Redshift
  Active Galactic Nuclei","We perform a detailed investigation of moderate-to-high quality X-ray spectra
of ten of the most luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) known at z>4 (up to
z~6.28). This study includes five new XMM observations and five archived X-ray
observations (four by XMM and one by Chandra). We find that the X-ray power-law
photon indices of our sample, composed of eight radio-quiet sources and two
that are moderately radio loud, are not significantly different from those of
lower redshift AGNs. The upper limits obtained on intrinsic neutral hydrogen
column densities, N_H<~10^{22}-10^{23} cm^{-2}, indicate that these AGNs are
not significantly absorbed. A joint fit performed on our eight radio-quiet
sources, with a total of ~7000 photons, constrains the mean photon index of z>4
radio-quiet AGNs to Gamma=1.97^{+0.06}_{-0.04}, with no detectable intrinsic
dispersion from source to source. We also obtain a strong constraint on the
mean intrinsic column density, N_H<~3x10^{21} cm^{-2}, showing that optically
selected radio-quiet AGNs at z>4 are, on average, not more absorbed than their
lower-redshift counterparts. All this suggests that the X-ray production
mechanism and the central environment in radio-quiet AGNs have not
significantly evolved over cosmic time. The mean equivalent width of a putative
neutral narrow Fe Ka line is constrained to be <~190 eV, and similarly we place
constraints on the mean Compton reflection component (R<~1.2). None of the AGNs
varied on short (~1 hr) timescales, but on longer timescales (months-to-years)
strong variability is observed in four of the sources. In particular, the X-ray
flux of the z=5.41 radio-quiet AGN SDSS 0231-0728 dropped by a factor of ~4
over a rest-frame period of 73 d. This is the most extreme X-ray variation
observed in a luminous z>4 radio-quiet AGN.",2005-05-23T20:22:26Z
Development of Kolmogorov spectrum in the pulsar radio emission,"It is shown that the scattering of electromagnetic waves by Langmuir ones
taking into the account the electric drift motion of particles, is the most
intense nonlinear process and should be responsible for the formation of
radiation spectrum of radio pulsars. Performed analysis indicates that in the
case of existence of inertial interval formation of stationary spectra is
possible. Analysis of linear mechanisms of wave generation and silk allows to
conclude that only possible stationary solution has spectral index $\alpha
=-1.5$. Obtained spectrum is in good agreement with observational data.",2005-05-12T14:07:16Z
Planar Integrated Optics and astronomical interferometry,"Integrated optics (IO) is an optical technology that allows to reproduce
optical circuits on a planar substrate. Since 1996, we have investigated the
potentiality of IO in the framework of astronomical single mode interferometry.
We review in this paper the principles of IO, the requirements for
interferometry and the corresponding solutions offered by IO, the results of
component characterization and the possible fields of application.",2005-08-01T10:29:23Z
Spatial Evidence for Transition Radiation in a Solar Radio Burst,"Microturbulence, i.e. enhanced fluctuations of plasma density, electric and
magnetic fields, is of great interest in astrophysical plasmas, but occurs on
spatial scales far too small to resolve by remote sensing, e.g., at ~ 1-100 cm
in the solar corona. This paper reports spatially resolved observations that
offer strong support for the presence in solar flares of a suspected radio
emission mechanism, resonant transition radiation, which is tightly coupled to
the level of microturbulence and provides direct diagnostics of the existence
and level of fluctuations on decimeter spatial scales. Although the level of
the microturbulence derived from the radio data is not particularly high,
<\Delta n^2 >/n^2 ~ 10^{-5}$, it is large enough to affect the charged particle
diffusion and give rise to effective stochastic acceleration. This finding has
exceptionally broad astrophysical implications since modern sophisticated
numerical models predict generation of much stronger turbulence in relativistic
objects, e.g., in gamma-ray burst sources.",2005-07-10T03:24:43Z
"Galaxies, Intergalactic Absorption Lines, and Feedback at High Redshift","The galaxy-IGM part of the Lyman-break survey currently consists of measured
redshifts for more than 1000 galaxies with redshift 1.5<z<3.5 along the
sightlines to 25 background QSOs. One of the goals of the survey was to measure
the influence on the intergalactic medium of energetic feedback from star and
black-hole formation. This talk begins with a description of the observed
correlations between galaxies and intergalactic absorption lines and ends with
a discussion of whether any of the observations provide clear evidence for
Mpc-scale superwinds. Although our own observations remain fairly ambiguous,
other observations disfavor a very high redshift (z~10) for the creation of
intergalactic metals.",2005-04-14T00:04:50Z
The giant H-alpha/X-ray filament in the cluster of galaxies A1795,"The cluster of galaxies A1795 hosts a 46 kpc-long filament at its core, which
is clearly visible in the light of H-alpha and X-ray emission. We present
optical slit spectroscopy and deeper Chandra X-ray data of the filament. The
optical spectra reveal that the the bulk of the filament is quiescent (with
sigma < 130 km/s), although considerable velocity structure is apparent around
the powerful radio source in the central cluster galaxy, where a direct
interaction is occurring between the radio plasma and the surrounding
intracluster medium. The filament contains a clump of UV/blue continuum halfway
along its length, which we resolve into a chain of at least 5 distinct knots
using archival HST images; the optical spectrum of this clump confirm it to be
mostly comprised of O stars. It is well-removed from the central galaxy and
radio source, and is most likely an example of a group of young star clusters
condensing directly from the cooling gas in the filament. The observed spatial
offset between these knots of star formation and the peak in the optical line
emission confirms that the massive star formation is most unlikely to be
responsible for the bulk of the observed emission-line luminosity in the
filament. Some other (as yet undetermined) source of energy is required to
power and maintain the optical line-emission, yet it must not completely impede
the cooling of the X-ray gas within the filament to form the star clusters.",2005-05-04T11:12:33Z
"Gravitational signals due to tidal interactions between white dwarfs and
  black holes","In this paper we compute the gravitational signal emitted when a white dwarf
moves around a black hole on a closed or open orbit using the affine model
approach. We compare the orbital and the tidal contributions to the signal,
assuming that the star moves in a safe region where, although very close to the
black hole, the strength of the tidal interaction is insufficient to provoque
the stellar disruption. We show that for all considered orbits the tidal signal
presents sharp peaks corresponding to the excitation of the star non radial
oscillation modes, the amplitude of which depends on how deep the star
penetrates the black hole tidal radius and on the type of orbit. Further
structure is added to the emitted signal by the coupling between the orbital
and the tidal motion.",2005-08-08T13:43:01Z
X-ray Bright QSO's around NGC 3079,"NGC 3079 is a very active, disturbed galaxy which has been observed to have
X-ray and radio ejections from it as well as an optical superbubble along its
minor axis. Here we show that the brightest X-ray sources within about 40
arcmin are in large excess of background values. The X-ray sources are
identified as quasars and AGN's which are aligned and spaced across the Seyfert
nucleus to a degree which is unlikely to be due to chance. The famous double
quasar which has been interpreted as a gravitational lens is discussed in terms
of the the X - ray and ULX sources which appear associated with NGC 3079.",2005-04-11T11:50:11Z
Discovery of deuterated water in a young proto-planetary disk,"We report the first detection of the ground transition of the deuterated
water at 464 GHz in the young proto-planetary disk surrounding the solar type
protostar DM Tau. The line is observed in absorption against the continuum from
the cold dust in the disk midplane, with a line to continuum ratio close to
unity. The observation implies that deuterated gaseous water is present, with a
relatively large abundance ($\sim 3\times10^{-9}$), in the outer disk above the
midplane, where the density is, within a factor ten, $\sim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and
the temperature is lower than about 25 K. In these conditions, the H$_2$O
condensation timescale is much smaller than the DM Tau disk age, and,
therefore, water should be fully frozen onto the grain mantles. We suggest that
UV photons and/or X-rays sublimate part of the mantles re-injecting the ices
into the gas phase. Even though there is currently no measurement of H$_2$O, we
provide arguments that the HDO/H$_2$O ratio should be about 0.01 or larger,
which would be hundreds of times larger than the values measured in Solar
System objects. This suggests the need of strong caution in comparing and
linking the HDO/H$_2$O in Solar System and star forming environments.",2005-08-11T12:39:25Z
Hydrodynamical scaling laws for astrophysical jets,"The idea of a unified model for all astrophysical jets has been considered
for some time now. We present here some hydrodynamical scaling laws relevant
for all type of astrophysical jets, analogous to those of Sams et al. (1996).
We use Buckingham's Pi theorem of dimensional analysis to obtain a family of
dimensional relations among the physical quantities associated with the jets.",2005-03-16T05:48:26Z
"The optical counterpart of XTE J0929-314, the third transient
  millisecond X-ray pulsar","A blue and variable optical counterpart of the X-ray transient XTE J0929-314
was identified on 2002 May 1. We conducted frequent BVRI broadband photometry
on this object using the Mt Canopus 1-m telescope during May and June until it
had faded to below 21'st magnitude. Nearly continuous I band CCD photometry on
2002 May 2, 3 and 4 revealed a ~ 10 % sinusoidal modulation at the binary
period lasting ~ 6 cycles during the latter half of May 2. The phase indicates
that the modulation may be due to a combination of emission by a hot spot on
the disc and X-ray heating of the secondary. The emission generally trended
bluer with B-I decreasing by 0.6 magnitudes during the observations but there
were anomalous changes in colour during the first few days after optical
identification when the I band flux decreased slightly while fluxes in other
bands increased. Spectral analysis of the BVRI broadband photometry show
evidence of a variable excess in the R and I bands. We suggest that this may be
due to synchrotron emission in matter flowing out of the system and note that
similar processes may have been responsible for anomalous V and I band
measurements in 1998 of the persistent millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX

Air Cherenkov Methods in Cosmic Rays: A Review and Some History,"The history of application of the Cherenkov light emission in the atmosphere
to cosmic ray and gamma-ray astronomy studies is briefly outlined with an
emphasis on the pioneering activity of A.E. Chudakov. The present-day situation
and some new ideas are also discussed.",2005-04-12T13:08:13Z
Concurrent 43 and 86 GHz Very Long Baseline Polarimetry of 3C273,"We present sub-milliarcsecond resolution total intensity and linear
polarization VLBI images of 3C273, using concurrent 43 and 86 GHz data taken
with the Very Long Baseline Array in May 2002. The structure seen in the
innermost jet suggest that we have fortuitously caught the jet in the act of
changing direction. The polarization images confirm that the core is
unpolarized (fractional polarization m < 1 %) at 86 GHz, but also show well
ordered magnetic fields (m ~ 15 %) in the inner jet, at a projected distance of
2.3 pc from the core. In this strongly polarized region, the rotation measure
changes across the jet by 4.2 x 10^{4} rad m^{-2} over an angular width of
about 0.3 milliarcseconds. If the lack of polarization in the core is also
attributed to a Faraday screen, then a rotation measure dispersion > 5.2 x
10^{4} rad m^{-2} must be present in or in front of that region. These are
among the highest rotation measures reported so far in the nucleus of any
active galaxy or quasar, and must occur outside (but probably close to) the
radio emitting region. The transverse rotation measure gradient is in the same
sense as that observed by Asada et al and by Zavala and Taylor at greater core
distances. The magnitude of the transverse gradient decreases rapidly with
distance down the jet, and appears to be variable.",2005-06-10T18:24:08Z
Cosmic Ray Spectral Deformation Caused by Energy Determination Errors,"Using simulation methods, distortion effects on energy spectra caused by
errors in the energy determination have been investigated. For cosmic ray
proton spectra, falling steeply with kinetic energy E as E-2.7, significant
effects appear. When magnetic spectrometers are used to determine the energy,
the relative error increases linearly with the energy and distortions with a
sinusoidal form appear starting at an energy that depends significantly on the
error distribution but at an energy lower than that corresponding to the
Maximum Detectable Rigidity of the spectrometer. The effect should be taken
into consideration when comparing data from different experiments, often having
different error distributions.",2005-05-10T14:57:40Z
IMF biases and how to correct them,"We discuss possible sources of biases in the determination of the initial
mass function (IMF) introduced by the binning of the data, the uncertainty in
the determinations of masses, and the existence of unresolved multiple systems.
Those three effects tend to produce IMFs that are flatter than the real one. We
analyze the importance of each effect and suggest techniques that minimize or
eliminate the biases. We also report the detection of the first astrometric
binary system composed of two very-early O-type stars, HD 93129 A.",2005-06-13T18:05:45Z
PNe in the dwarf galaxy NGC 6822: Detection of new candidates,"We have discovered 13 new candidate Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in the dwarf

"Color--Magnitude Diagrams and Luminosity Functions down to the Hydrogen
  Burning Limit. III. A Preliminary HST Study of NGC6791","Using HST ACS/WFC images, we derive the color--magnitude diagram of the old,
metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791 to nearly 29th magnitude in V, which is the
neighborhood of the hydrogen-burning limit.Comparison with isochrones leads to
a discussion of the distance modulus, the reddening, and the age of the
cluster. By making a statistical correction for field stars we derive a
preliminary luminosity function, and a very tentative mass function. The white
dwarf sequence is clearly shown, and has been discussed in a separate paper.",2005-04-28T09:32:13Z
"Evaluating Gaia performances on eclipsing binaries. IV. Orbits and
  stellar parameters for SV Cam, BS Dra and HP Dra","This is the fourth in a series of papers that aim both to provide reasonable
orbits for a number of eclipsing binaries and to evaluate the expected
performance of Gaia of these objects and the accuracy that is achievable in the
determination of such fundamental stellar parameters as mass and radius. In
this paper, we attempt to derive the orbits and physical parameters for three
eclipsing binaries in the mid-F to mid-G spectral range. As for previous
papers, only the Hp, Vt, Bt photometry from the Hipparcos/Tycho mission and
ground-based radial velocities from spectroscopy in the region 8480-8740 A are
used in the analyses. These data sets simulate the photometric and
spectroscopic data that are expected to be obtained by Gaia, the approved ESA
Cornerstone mission to be launched in 2011. The systems targeted in this paper
are SV Cam, BS Dra and HP Dra. SV Cam and BS Dra have been studied previously,
allowing comparisons of the derived parameters with those from full scale and
devoted ground-based investigations. HP Dra has no published orbital solution.
SV Cam has a beta Lyrae type light curve and the others have Algol-like light
curves. SV Cam has the complication of light curve anomalies, usually
attributed to spots; BS Dra has non-solar metallicity, and HP Dra appears to
have a small eccentricity and a sizeable time derivative in the argument of the
periastron. Thus all three provide interesting and different test cases.",2005-06-06T10:07:02Z
The Accretion of Dark Energy onto a Black Hole,"The stationary, spherically symmetric accretion of dark energy onto a
Schwarzschild black hole is considered in terms of relativistic hydrodynamics.
The approximation of an ideal fluid is used to model the dark energy. General
expressions are derived for the accretion rate of an ideal fluid with an
arbitrary equation of state p=p(\rho) onto a black hole. The black hole mass
was found to decrease for the accretion of phantom energy. The accretion
process is studied in detail for two dark energy models that admit an
analytical solution: a model with a linear equation of state,
p=\alpha(\rho-\rho_0), and a Chaplygin gas. For one of the special cases of a
linear equation of state, an analytical expression is derived for the accretion
rate of dark energy onto a moving and rotating black hole. The masses of all
black holes are shown to approach zero in cosmological models with phantom
energy in which the Big Rip scenario is realized.",2005-05-31T11:25:13Z
The Unusual Luminosity Function of the Globular Cluster M10,"We present the I-band luminosity function of the differentially reddened
globular cluster M10. We combine photometric analysis derived from wide-field
(23' x 23') images that include the outer regions of the cluster and
high-resolution images of the cluster core. After making corrections for
incompleteness and field star contamination, we find that the relative numbers
of stars on the lower giant branch and near the main-sequence turnoff are in
good agreement with theoretical predictions. However, we detect significant (>
6 \sigma) excesses of red giant branch stars above and below the red giant
branch bump using a new statistic (a population ratio) for testing relative
evolutionary timescales of main-sequence and red giant stars. The statistic is
insensitive to assumed cluster chemical composition, age, and main-sequence
mass function. The excess number of red giants cannot be explained by
reasonable systematic errors in our assumed cluster chemical composition, age,
or main-sequence mass function. Moreover, M10 shows excesses when compared to
the cluster M12, which has nearly identical metallicity, age, and
color-magnitude diagram morphology. We discuss possible reasons for this
anomaly, finding that the most likely cause is a mass function slope that shows
significant variations as a function of mass.",2005-04-08T23:51:17Z
The Effects of Gravitational Back-Reaction on Cosmological Perturbations,"Because of the non-linearity of the Einstein equations, the cosmological
fluctuations which are generated during inflation on a wide range of
wavelengths do not evolve independently. In particular, to second order in
perturbation theory, the first order fluctuations back-react both on the
background geometry and on the perturbations themselves. I this paper, the
gravitational back-reaction of long wavelength (super-Hubble) scalar metric
fluctuations on the perturbations themselves is investigated for a large class
of inflationary models. Specifically, the equations describing the evolution of
long wavelength cosmological metric and matter perturbations in an inflationary
universe are solved to second order in both the amplitude of the perturbations
and in the slow roll expansion parameter. Assuming that the linear fluctuations
have random phases, we show that the fractional correction to the power
spectrum due to the leading infrared back-reaction terms does not change the
shape of the spectrum. The amplitude of the effect is suppressed by the product
of the inflationary slow-roll parameter and the amplitude of the linear power
spectrum. The non-gaussianity of the spectrum induced by back-reaction is
commented upon.",2005-05-11T21:24:05Z
Secular Evolution Via Bar-Driven Gas Inflow: Results from BIMA SONG,"We present an analysis of the molecular gas distributions in the 29 barred
and 15 unbarred spirals in BIMA SONG. For CO-bright galaxies, we confirm the
conclusion by Sakamoto et al. (1999b) that barred spirals have higher molecular
gas concentrations in the central kiloparsec. The SONG sample also includes 27
galaxies below the CO brightness limit used by Sakamoto et al. Even in these
CO-faint galaxies we show that high central gas concentrations are more common
in barred galaxies, consistent with radial inflow driven by the bar. However,
there is a significant population of early-type (Sa--Sbc) barred spirals (6 of
19) that have little or no molecular gas detected in the nuclear region and out
to the bar co-rotation radius. In these galaxies, the bar has already driven
most of the gas within the bar to the nuclear region, where it has been
consumed by star formation. The median nuclear gas mass is over four times
higher in early type bars; since the gas consumption rate is an order of
magnitude higher in early type bars, early types must have significantly higher
bar-driven inflows. The lower inflow rates in late type bars can be attributed
to differences in bar structure between early and late types. Despite
bar-driven inflows, the data indicate that it is highly unlikely for a late
type galaxy to evolve into an early type via bar-induced gas inflow.
Nonetheless, secular evolutionary processes are undoubtedly present, and
pseudo-bulges are inevitable; evidence for pseudo-bulges is likely to be
clearest in early-type galaxies because of their high gas inflow rates and
higher star formation activity (abridged).",2005-05-18T21:09:38Z
"Detection and analysis of a new INTEGRAL hard X-ray transient, IGR
  J17285-2922","We present the transient nature of INTEGRAL source IGR J17285-2922,
identified from a single period of activity during an IBIS/ISGRI Galactic
Centre Deep Exposure in September 2003. The source has a maximum detection
significance of 14 sigma in the 20-100 keV energy range and exhibits a flux of
6.5 mCrab before it moves out of the ISGRI field of view. The source is visible
to at least 150 keV and its spectrum can be fit with a power law slope of
Gamma=2.1+/-0.17; a more physical model could not be fit due to poor
statistics. Detected characteristics are consistent with the source being a
Galactic low-mass X-ray binary harbouring a black hole or neutron star.",2005-05-19T13:02:16Z
"The evolution of the ultraviolet and infrared luminosity densities in
  the universe at 0<z<1","The ratio between far-ultraviolet (FUV) and infrared (IR) luminosity
densities from z=0 to z=1 is discussed by using the luminosity functions (LFs)
of both wavelengths. The FUV LF (z=0-1) based on GALEX has been reported by
Arnouts et al. (2005), whilst for the IR LF, we used the IRAS PSCz 60-um LF for
the local universe and the Spitzer 15-um LF at higher-z as used by Le Floch et
al. (2005). Both luminosity densities show a significant evolutionary trend,
but the IR evolves much faster than the FUV. Consequently, the ratio
$\rho_{dust}/\rho_{FUV}$ increases toward higher-z, from 4 (local) to 15 (z =
1). It is also shown that more than 70% of the star formation activity in the
universe is obscured by dust at 0.5 < z < 1.2.",2005-08-04T06:33:17Z
Gamma-Ray Burst Jet Profiles And Their Signatures,"HETE-II and BeppoSAX have produced a sample of GRBs and XRFs with known
redshifts and $E_{pk}$. This sample provides four important empirical
constraints on the nature of the source jets: Log $E_{iso}$ is approximately
uniformly distributed over several orders of magnitude; the inferred prompt
energy Log $E_{\gamma}$ is narrowly distributed; the Amati relation holds
between $E_{iso}$ and $E_{pk}$; and the Ghirlanda relation holds between
$E_{\gamma}$ and $E_{pk}$.
  We explore the implications of these constraints for GRB jet structure during
the prompt emission phase. We infer the underlying angular profiles from the
first two of the above constraints assuming all jets have the same profile and
total energy, and show that such ``universal jet'' models cannot satisfy both
constraints.
  We introduce a general and efficient method for calculating relativistic
emission distributions and $E_{pk}$ distributions from jets with arbitrary
(smooth) angular jet profiles. We also exhibit explicit analytical formulas for
emission from top-hat jets (which are not smooth). We use these methods to
exhibit $E_{pk}$ and $E_{iso}$ as a function of viewing angle, for several
interesting families of GRB jet profiles. We use the same methods to calculate
expected frequency distributions of $E_{iso}$ and $E_{\gamma}$ for the same
families of models.
  We then proceed to explore the behavior of universal jet models under a range
of profile shapes and parameters, to map the extent to which these models can
conform to the above four empirical constraints.",2005-05-31T14:48:53Z
"Possible Dark Matter Signals from Antiprotons, Positrons, X-rays and
  Gamma-rays","A number of signals involving charged cosmic rays and high-energy photons
have been interpreted as being due to annihilating dark matter. This article
provides an overview of the experimental evidence and discusses in particular
detections of antiprotons and positrons in the cosmic radiation, the diffuse
gamma-ray emission between 10 MeV and 100 GeV from the Milky Way, and the 511
keV annihilation radiation and the flux of very high-energy photons (>100 GeV)

Ep-Eiso Correlation in a Multiple Subjet Model of Gamma-Ray Bursts,"We perform Monte Carlo simulations to study Ep-Eiso correlation in the
context of a multiple subjet model (or inhomogeneous jet model) for gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), X-ray--rich GRBs (XRRs), and X-ray flashes (XRFs). For a single
subjet, we find that Ep prop. Eiso^0.4 for large viewing angles. For the
multiple subjet model in which all the subjets have the same intrinsic
properties, off-axis events show Ep prop. Eiso^a with 0.4<a<0.5. If the
intrinsic properties of the subjets are distributed so that on-axis emission of
each subjet follows a correlation Ep prop. Liso^1/2, we obtain the Amati
correlation (Ep prop. Eiso^1/2) over three orders of magnitude in Ep. Although
the scatter around the Amati correlation is large in the simulation, the
results are consistent with the observed properties of GRBs with known
redshifts and the BASTE GRBs with pseudo redshifts derived from the
lag-luminosity correlation. We also calculate the event rates, the redshift
distributions, and the T90 duration distributions of GRBs, XRRs, and XRFs which
can be detected by HETE-2, assuming that the source redshift distribution is in
proportion to the cosmic star formation rate. It is found that the event rates
of three classes are comparable, that the average redshift of the XRRs is a
little larger than those of the GRBs and the XRFs, and that short XRRs arise
when a single subjet is viewed off-axis or viewed on-axis with slightly high
redshift.",2005-04-28T07:59:24Z
"An asteroseismic study of the Beta Cephei star Theta Ophiuchi:
  photometric results","We have carried out a three-site photometric campaign for the Beta Cephei
star Theta Ophiuchi from April to August 2003. 245 hours of differential
photoelectric uvy photometry were obtained during 77 clear nights. The
frequency analysis of our measurements resulted in the detection of seven
pulsation modes within a narrow frequency interval between 7.116 and 7.973 c/d.
No combination or harmonic frequencies were found. We performed a mode
identification of the individual pulsations from our colour photometry that
shows the presence of one radial mode, one rotationally split l=1 triplet and
possibly three components of a rotationally split l=2 quintuplet. We discuss
the implications of our findings and point out the similarity of the pulsation
spectrum of Theta Ophiuchi to that of another Beta Cephei star, V836 Cen.",2005-06-27T13:20:30Z
Diffuse polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster,"We report on full-polarization radio observations of the Perseus cluster
(Abell 426) using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at
wavelengths from 81-95 cm. We have employed a novel technique, Rotation Measure
synthesis (Brentjens and de Bruyn, 2005) to unravel the polarization properties
of the emission across the full field of view and detect polarized emission
over a wide range of RM from about 0 to 90 rad m^-2. The low RM emission is
associated with our Galaxy, while the high RM emission is associated with the
Perseus cluster. The latter reaches typical surface brightness levels of 0.5-1
mJy per beam and must be rather highly polarized. Most of the peripheral
polarized emission appears too bright, by about 1-2 orders of magnitude, to be
explainable as Thomson scattered emission of the central radio source off the
thermal electrons in the cluster. The bulk of the emission associated with the
Perseus cluster is probably related to buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma,
probably relics from still active or now dormant AGN within the cluster. A
lenticular shaped structure measuring 0.5-1 Mpc is strikingly similar to the
structures predicted by Ensslin et al. (1998). At the western edge of the
cluster, we detect very long, linear structures that may be related to shocks
caused by infall of gas into the Perseus cluster.",2005-07-14T15:14:41Z
"Rest-frame Ultraviolet-to-Optical Properties of Galaxies at z ~ 6 and 5
  in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field: from Hubble to Spitzer","We use data from the first epoch of observations with the IRAC/Spitzer for
the GOODS to detect and study a collection of LBGs at z ~ 6 to 5 in the HUDF,
six of which have spectroscopic confirmation. At these redshifts, IRAC samples
rest-frame optical light in the range 0.5 to 0.8 um, where the effects of dust
extinction are smaller and the sensitivity to light from evolved stars is
greater than at shorter, rest-frame UV observable from the ground or with the
HST. As such, it provides useful constraints on the ages and masses of these
galaxies' stellar populations. We find that the SEDs for many of these galaxies
are best fitted by models of stellar populations with masses of a few x 1e10
M_sun, and with ages of a few hundred Myrs, values quite similar to those
derived for typical LBGs at z ~ 3. When the universe was only 1 Gyr old, some
galaxies had already formed a mass of stars approaching that of the present-day
Milky Way, and that they started forming those stars at z > 7, and in some
cases much earlier. We find that the lower limits to the space density for
galaxies in this mass range are consistent with predictions from recent
hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation in a LCDM universe. All objects
in our samples are consistent with having solar metallicity, suggesting that
they might have already been significantly polluted by metals. The values for
dust reddening derived from the model fitting are low or zero, and we find that
some of the galaxies have rest-frame UV colors that are even bluer than those
predicted by the stellar population models to which we compare them. These
colors might be attributed to the presence of very massive stars (> 100 M_sun),
or by weaker intergalactic HI absorption than what is commonly assumed.",2005-07-28T17:52:06Z
Black Hole Shadows of Charged Spinning Black Holes,"We propose a method for measuring the black hole charge by imaging a black
hole shadow in a galactic center by future interferometers. Even when the black
hole is uncharged, it is possible to confirm the charge neutrality by this
method. We first derive the analytic formulae of the black hole shadow in an
optically thin medium around a charged spinning black hole, and then
investigate how contours of the black hole shadow depend on the spin and the
charge of the black hole for several inclination angles between the rotation
axis of the black hole and the observer. This method only assumes stationary
black hole and general relativity. By fitting the formula of the contours of
the shadow to the observed image of the shadow, in addition to the black hole
charge, one can also determine the black hole spin and the inclination angle
without any degeneracy among the charge, the spin, and the inclination angle
unless the inclination angle is null.",2005-05-16T07:42:08Z
"The Mass Function of Dark Matter Haloes in a Cosmological Model with a
  Running Primordial Power Spectrum","We present the first study on the mass functions of Jenkins et al (J01) and
an estimate of their corresponding largest virialized dark halos in the
Universe for a variety of dark-energy cosmological models with a running
spectral index. Compared with the PL-CDM model, the RSI-CDM model can raise the
mass abundance of dark halos for small mass halos at lower redshifts, but it is
not apparent on scales of massive mass halos. Particularly, this discrepancy
increases largely with the decrease of redshift, and the RSI-CDM model can
suppress the mass abundance on any scale of halo masses at higher redshift. As
for the largest mass of virialized halos, the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM
models give more massive mass of virialized objects than other models for both
of PL-CDM and RSI-CDM power spectral indexs, and the RSI-CDM model can enhance
the mass of largest virialized halos for all of models considered in this
paper. So we probably distinguish the PL-CDM and RSI-CDM models by the largest
virialized halos in the future survey of cluster of galaxies.",2005-04-09T05:14:02Z
Flow equations in generalized braneworld scenarios,"We discuss the flow equations in the context of general braneworld
cosmologies with a modified Friedmann equation, for either an ordinary scalar
field or a Dirac-Born-Infeld tachyon as inflaton candidates. The 4D,
Randall-Sundrum, and Gauss-Bonnet cases are compared, using the patch formalism
which provides a unified description of these models. The inflationary dynamics
is described by a tower of flow parameters that can be evolved in time to
select a particular subset of points in the space of cosmological observables.
We analyze the stability of the fixed points in all the cosmologies (our
results in the 4D case already extending those in the literature). Numerical
integration of the flow equations shows that the predictions of the
Gauss-Bonnet braneworld differ significantly as compared to the Randall-Sundrum
and 4D scenarios, whereas tachyon inflation gives tensor perturbations smaller
than those in the presence of a normal scalar field. These results are extended
to the realization of a noncommutative space-time preserving maximal symmetry.
In this case the tensor-to-scalar signal is unchanged, while blue-tilted
spectra are favoured.",2005-06-23T13:27:08Z
"The Absence of Extra-Tidal Structure in the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal
  Galaxy","The results of a wide-field survey of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy
are presented. Our aims were to obtain an accurate map of the outer structure
of Sculptor, and to determine the level of interaction between this system and
the Galaxy. Photometry was obtained in two colours down to the magnitude limits
of V=20 and I=19, covering a 3.1 times 3.1 square deg area centred on Sculptor.
The resulting colour-magnitude data were used as a mask to select candidate
horizontal branch and red giant branch stars for this system. Previous work has
shown that the red horizontal branch (HB) stars are more concentrated than the
blue HB stars. We have determined the radial distributions of these two
populations and show that the overall Sculptor density profile is well
described by a two component model based on a combination of these radial
distributions. Additionally, spectra of the Ca ii triplet region were obtained
for over 700 candidate red giant stars over the 10 square deg region using the
2dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. These spectra were used to
remove foreground Galactic stars based on radial velocity and Ca ii triplet
strength. The final list of Sculptor members contained 148 stars, seven of
which are located beyond the nominal tidal radius. Both the photometric and
spectroscopic datasets indicate no significant extra-tidal structure. These
results support at most a mild level of interaction between this system and the
Galaxy, and we have measured an upper mass limit for extra-tidal material to be
2.3 +/- 0.6% of the Sculptor luminous mass. This lack of tidal interaction
indicates that previous velocity dispersion measurements (and hence the amount
of dark matter detected) in this system are not strongly influenced by the
Galactic tidal field.",2005-06-03T02:29:07Z
"Strong CaII absorption lines in the reddened quasar SDSS J2339$-$0912:
  Evidence of the collision/merger in the host galaxy?","We report the detection of strong CaII/MgII absorption lines at the quasar
redshift in the narrow line quasar SDSS J2339-0912 (z=0.6604). The quasar
exhibits strong FeII, small Balmer emission line width and a very red B-Ks
color. Both the optical continuum and broad emission lines are reddened by
SMC-like dust of E(B-V)~1.0 mag, while its near-infrared color (J-Ks=1.60)
shows little reddening. The CaII absorption lines are saturated and resolved
with an FWHM of 362 km/s and an equivalent width of W_{CaII K}=4.2\AA (in the
source rest frame). MgII absorption lines are also saturated and have a similar
line width. The line profile and the fact that there is no evidence for
starlight from the host galaxy suggest that these absorption lines are not of a
stellar origin. The ratio of column density of CaII to that of dust is
consistent with that of the ISM in our Galaxy. We suggest that both the heavy
reddening and the large absorption line width are due to the highly disturbed
ISM on the line of sight toward the quasar, and that the disturbance is caused
by a galaxy collision or even merger in the quasar host galaxy.",2005-04-14T10:52:32Z
"Upper limits on gravitational waves emission in association with the Dec
  27 2004 giant flare of SGR1806-20","At the time when the giant flare of SGR1806-20 occurred, the AURIGA ""bar"" gw
detector was on the air with a noise performance close to stationary gaussian.
This allows to set relevant upper limits, at a number of frequencies in the
vicinities of 900 Hz, on the amplitude of the damped gw wave trains, which,
according to current models, could have been emitted, due to the excitation of
normal modes of the star associated with the peak in X-rays luminosity.",2005-06-07T12:21:56Z
On the Dayside Thermal Emission of Hot Jupiters,"We discuss atmosphere models of HD209458b in light of the recent day-side
flux measurement of HD209458b's secondary eclipse by Spitzer-MIPS at 24
microns. In addition, we present a revised secondary eclipse IRTF upper limit
at 2.2 microns which places a stringent constraint on the adjacent H2O
absorption band depths. These two measurements are complementary because they
are both shaped by H2O absorption and because the former is on the Wien tail of
the planet's thermal emission spectrum and the latter is near the thermal
emission peak. A wide range of models fit the observational data, confirming
our basic understanding of hot Jupiter atmospheric physics. Although a range of
models are viable, some models at the hot and cold end of the plausible
temperature range can be ruled out. One class of previously unconsidered hot
Jupiter atmospheric models that fit the data are those with C/O >~ 1 (as
Jupiter may have), which have a significant paucity of H2O compared to solar
abundance models with C/O = 0.5. The models indicate that HD209458b is in a
situation intermediate between pure in situ reradiation and very efficient
redistribution of heat; one which will require a careful treatment of
atmospheric circulation. We discuss how future wavelength-dependent and
phase-dependent observations will further constrain the atmospheric circulation
regime. In the shorter term, additional planned measurements for HD209458b,
especially Spitzer IRAC photometry, should lift many of the model degeneracies.
Multiwavelength IR observations constrain the atmospheric structure and
circulation properties of hot Jupiters and thus open a new chapter in
quantitative extrasolar planetology.",2005-04-08T17:03:19Z
A companion to AB Pic at the planet/brown dwarf boundary,"We report deep imaging observations of the young, nearby star AB Pic, a
member of the large Tucana-Horologium as sociation. We have detected a faint,
red source 5.5"" South of the star with JHK colors compatible with that of a
young substellar L dwarf. Follow-up observations at two additional epochs
confirm, with a confidence level of 4.7sigma, that the faint red object is a
companion to AB Pic rather than it being a stationary background object. A low
resolution K-band spectrum indicates an early-L spectral type for the
companion. Finally, evolutionary model predictions based on the JHK photometry

Infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of Nearby Galaxies,"The Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) is carrying out a
comprehensive multi-wavelength survey on a sample of 75 nearby galaxies. The
1-850um spectral energy distributions are presented using broadband imaging
data from Spitzer, 2MASS, ISO, IRAS, and SCUBA. The infrared colors derived
from the globally-integrated Spitzer data are generally consistent with the
previous generation of models that were developed based on global data for
normal star-forming galaxies, though significant deviations are observed.
Spitzer's excellent sensitivity and resolution also allow a detailed
investigation of the infrared spectral energy distributions for various
locations within the three large, nearby galaxies NGC3031 (M81), NGC5194 (M51),
and NGC7331. Strong correlations exist between the local star formation rate
and the infrared colors f_nu(70um)/f_nu(160um) and f_nu(24um)/f_nu(160um),
suggesting that the 24 and 70um emission are useful tracers of the local star
formation activity level. Preliminary evidence indicates that variations in the
24um emission, and not variations in the emission from polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons at 8um, drive the variations in the f_nu(8.0um)/f_nu(24um) colors
within NGC3031, NGC5194, and NGC7331. If the galaxy-to-galaxy variations in
spectral energy distributions seen in our sample are representative of the
range present at high redshift then extrapolations of total infrared
luminosities and star formation rates from the observed 24um flux will be
uncertain at the factor-of-five level (total range). The corresponding
uncertainties using the redshifted 8.0um flux (e.g. observed 24um flux for a
z=2 source) are factors of 10-20. Considerable caution should be used when
interpreting such extrapolated infrared luminosities.",2005-07-27T18:44:51Z
The HI content of Fornax dwarf elliptical galaxies: FCC032 and FCC336,"We present HI 21cm line observations, obtained with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array, of two dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) in the Fornax cluster:
FCC032 and FCC336. The optical positions and velocities of these galaxies place
them well within the Fornax cluster. FCC032 was detected at the 3sigma
significance level with a total HI flux density of 0.66+-0.22 Jy km s^-1 or an
HI mass of 5.0+-1.7 10^7 h_75^-2 M_sun. Based on our deep Halpha+[NII]
narrow-band images, obtained with FORS2 mounted on the VLT, this dE was already
known to contain 600-1800 h_75^-2 M_sun of ionised Hydrogen (depending on the
relative strengths of the Halpha and [NII] emission lines). Hence, this is the
first study of the complex, multi-phase interstellar medium of a dE outside the
Local Group. FCC336 was detected at the same significance level: 0.37+-0.10 Jy
km s^-1 or a total HI mass of 2.8+-0.7 10^7 h_75^-2,M_sun. Using a compilation
of HI data of dwarf galaxies, we find that the observed high HI-mass boundary
of the distribution of dIrrs, BCDs, and dEs in a log(L_B) versus log (M_HI)
diagram is in good agreement with a simple chemical evolution model with
continuous star formation. The existence of many gas-poor dEs (undetected at
21cm) suggest that the environment (or more particularly, a galaxy's orbit
within a cluster) also plays a crucial role in determining the amount of gas in
present-day dEs. E.g., FCC032 and FCC336 are located in the sparsely populated
outskirts of the Fornax cluster. This is in agreement with HI surveys of dEs in
the Virgo Cluster and an Halpha survey of the Fornax Cluster, which also tend
to place gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the cluster periphery.",2005-04-12T13:12:30Z
Radio Spectroscopy of Active Galactic Nuclei,"Radio spectroscopy offers a number of tools for studying a large variety of
astrophysical phenomena, ranging from stars and their environment to
interstellar and intergalactic medium, active galactic nuclei (AGN) and distant
quasars. Main targets of extragalactic radio spectroscopy are atomic and
molecular material in galaxies, HII regions, and maser emission originating in
the dense, circumnuclear regions. These studies cover all galactic types and
span an impressive range of angular scales and distances. Molecular emission,
hydrogen absorption and maser lines have become the tools of choice for making
an assessment of physical conditions in the nuclear regions of galaxies. In
this contribution, some of the recent advances in the aforementioned fields
will be reviewed and discussed in connection with future radio astronomical
facilities.",2005-07-28T13:53:08Z
The H II Region of the First Star,"Simulations predict that the first stars in an LCDM universe formed at
redshifts z>20 in minihalos with masses of about 10^6 M_sun. We have studied
their radiative feedback by simulating the propagation of ionization fronts
(I-fronts) created by these first Population III stars (M_* = 15-500 M_sun) at
z=20, within the density field of a cosmological simulation of primordial star
formation, outward thru the host minihalo and into the surrounding gas. A
three-dimensional ray-tracing calculation tracks the I-front once the H II
region evolves a ""champagne flow'' inside the minihalo, after the early D-type
I-front detaches from the shock and runs ahead, becoming R-type. We take
account of the hydrodynamical back-reaction by an approximate model of the
central wind. We find that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from the
host halo increases with stellar mass, with 0.7 < f_esc <0.9 for 80 < M_*/M_sun
< 500. To quantify the ionizing efficiency of these stars as they begin cosmic
reionization, we find that, for M_* > 80 M_sun, the ratio of gas mass ionized
to stellar mass is ~60,000, roughly half the number of ionizing photons
released per stellar baryon. Nearby minihalos are shown to trap the I-front, so
their centers remain neutral. This is contrary to the recent suggestion that
these stars would trigger formation of a second generation by fully ionizing
neighboring minihalos, stimulating H_2 formation in their cores. Finally, we
discuss how the evacuation of gas from the host halo reduces the growth and
luminosity of ""miniquasars'' that may form from black hole remnants of the
first stars.",2005-07-29T01:23:12Z
"IRS 16SW - A New Comoving Group of Young Stars in the Central Parsec of
  the Milky Way","One of the most perplexing problems associated with the supermassive black
hole at the center of our Galaxy is the origin of the young stars in its close
vicinity. Using proper motion measurements and stellar number density counts
based on 9 years of diffraction-limited K(2.2 micron)-band speckle imaging at
the W. M. Keck 10-meter telescopes, we have identified a new comoving group of
stars, which we call the IRS 16SW comoving group, located 1.9"" (0.08 pc, in
projection) from the central black hole. Four of the five members of this
comoving group have been spectroscopically identified as massive young stars,
specifically He I emission-line stars and OBN stars. This is the second young
comoving group within the central parsec of the Milky Way to be recognized and
is the closest, by a factor of 2, in projection to the central black hole.
These comoving groups may be the surviving cores of massive infalling star
clusters that are undergoing disruption in the strong tidal field of the
central supermassive black hole.",2005-04-12T19:02:34Z
Near infrared and the inner regions of protoplanetary disks,"We examine the ``puffed-up inner disk'' model (Dullemond, Dominik & Natta
2001), proposed for explaining the near-IR excess radiation from Herbig Ae/Be
stars. Detailed model computations show that the observed near-IR excess
requires more hot dust than is contained in the puffed-up disk rim. The rim can
produce the observed near-IR excess only if its dust has perfectly gray
opacity, but such dust is in conflict with the observed 10$\mu$m spectral
feature. We find that a compact ($\sim$ 10 AU) tenuous ($\tau_V \la 0.4$) dusty
halo around the disk inner regions contains enough dust to readily explain the
observations. Furthermore, this model also resolves the puzzling relationship
noted by Monnier and Millan-Gabet (2002) between luminosity and the
interferometric inner radii of disks.",2005-06-07T22:01:39Z
On the Size Distribution of Close-In Extrasolar Giant Planets,"The precisions of extrasolar planet radius measurements are reaching the
point at which meaningful and discriminatory comparisons with theoretical
predictions are can be made. However, care must be taken to account for
selection effects in the transit surveys that detect the transiting planets for
which radius measurements are possible. Here I identify one such selection
effect, such that the number of planets with radius R_p detected in a
signal-to-noise ratio limited transit survey is proportional to R_p^alpha, with
alpha~4-6. In the presence of a dispersion sigma in the intrinsic distribution
of planet radii, this selection effect translates to bias b in the radii of
observed planets. Detected planets are, on average, larger by a fractional
amount b ~ alpha (sigma/<R_p>)^2 relative to the mean radius <R_p> of the
underlying distribution. I argue that the intrinsic dispersion in planetary
radii is likely to be in the range sigma = (0.05-0.13)R_J, where the lower
bound is that expected theoretically solely from the variance in stellar
insolation, and the upper bound is the 95% c.l. upper limit from the scatter in
observed radii. Assuming an arbitrary but plausible value of sigma/<R_p>~10%,
and thus b~6%, I infer a mean intrinsic radius of close-in massive extrasolar
planets of <R_p>=(1.03+/-0.01)R_J. This value reinforces the case for HD209458b
having an anomalously large radius, and may be inconsistent with coreless
models of irradiated giant planets.",2005-04-05T20:00:03Z
"Spectroscopic Confirmation of Multiple Red Galaxy-Galaxy Mergers in
  MS1054-03 (z=0.83)","We present follow-up spectroscopy of the galaxy cluster MS1054-03 (z=0.83)
confirming that at least six of the nine merging galaxy pairs identified by van
Dokkum et al. (1999) are indeed bound systems: they have projected separations
of R_s<10 kpc and relative line-of sight velocities of dv<165 km/s. For the
remaining three pairs, we were unable to obtain redshifts of both constituent
galaxies. To identify a more objective sample of merging systems, we select
bound red galaxy pairs (R_s<=30 kpc, dv<=300 km/s) from our sample of 121
confirmed cluster members: galaxies in bound red pairs make up 15.7+/-3.6% of
the cluster population. The (B-K_s) color-magnitude diagram shows that the pair
galaxies are as red as the E/S0 members and have a homogeneous stellar
population. The red pair galaxies span a large range in luminosity and internal
velocity dispersion to include some of the brightest, most massive members
(L>L*, sigma>200 km/s); these bound galaxy pairs must evolve into E/S0 members
by z~0.7. These results combined with MS1054's high merger fraction and
reservoir of likely future mergers indicates that most, if not all, of its
early-type members evolved from (passive) galaxy-galaxy mergers at z<~1.",2005-05-17T19:24:44Z
Gradient expansion(s) and dark energy,"Motivated by recent claims stating that the acceleration of the present
Universe is due to fluctuations with wavelength larger than the Hubble radius,
we present a general analysis of various perturbative solutions of fully
inhomogeneous Einstein equations supplemented by a perfect fluid. The
equivalence of formally different gradient expansions is demonstrated. If the
barotropic index vanishes, the deceleration parameter is always positive
semi-definite.",2005-06-29T06:44:51Z
High energy gamma-ray emission from the starburst nucleus of NGC 253,"The high density medium that characterizes the central regions of starburst
galaxies and its power to accelerate particles up to relativistic energies make
these objects good candidates as $\gamma$-rays sources. In this paper, a
self-consistent model of the multifrequency emission of the starburst galaxy
NGC 253, from radio to gamma-rays, is presented. The model is in agreement with
all current measurements and provides predictions for the high energy behavior
of the NGC 253 central region. Prospects for observations with the HESS array
and GLAST satellite are especially discussed.",2005-06-10T14:50:20Z
2dFGRS and SDSS Galaxy Group Density Profiles,"We have analysed the distribution of galaxies in groups identified in the
largest redshift surveys at the present: the final release of the 2dF Galaxy
Redshift Survey and the first release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our work
comprises the study of the galaxy density profiles and the fraction of galaxies
per spectral type as a function of the group-centric distance. We have
calculated the projected galaxy density profiles of galaxy groups using
composite samples in order to increase the statistical significance of the
results. Special cares have been taken in order to avoid possible biases in the
group identification and the construction of the projected galaxy density
profile estimator. The results show that the projected galaxy density profiles
obtained for both redshift surveys are in agreement with a projected Navarro,
Frenk & White predictions in the range $0.15< r/r_{200}
  < 1$, whereas a good fit for the measured profiles in the whole range of
$r/r_{200}$ is given by a projected King profile. We have adopted a generalized
King profile to fit the measured projected density profiles per spectral type.
In order to infer the 3-D galaxy density profiles, we deproject the 2-D density
profiles using a deprojection method similar to the developed by Allen &
Fabian. From 2-D and 3-D galaxy density profiles we have estimated the
corresponding galaxy fractions per spectral type. The 2-D fraction of galaxies
computed using the projected profiles show a similar segregation of galaxy
spectral types as the obtained by Dom\'{\i}nguez et al. for groups in the early
data release of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. As expected, the trends
obtained for the 3-D galaxy fractions show steeper slopes than the observed in
the 2-D fractions.",2005-04-20T21:13:31Z
"Emission-line spectroscopy of Damped Lyman Alpha Systems: The case of
  SBS 1543+593/HS 1543+5921","We report HST/STIS spectroscopy and Gemini/GMOS-N imaging of the Damped Lyman
Alpha (DLA) system toward HS 1543+5921 caused by the host star-forming galaxy
(SFG) SBS 1543+593. The Gemini image shows new morphological details of this
well resolved DLA galaxy. In combination with previous optical spectra, the new
UV spectra enable us to compare for the first time, ionized and neutral
gas-phase alpha-element abundances derived from emission- and absorption-line
spectroscopy, in a bona fide DLA galaxy. The abundances we determine using
emission-line diagnostics agree with those from absorption-line diagnostics. We
present our results on a metallicity versus redshift diagram that combines
local HII regions and SFGs with high-redshift DLAs, and discuss implications
for the chemical evolution of galaxies.",2005-04-25T19:55:30Z
"Constraints on gamma-ray burst and supernova progenitors through
  circumstellar absorption lines","Long gamma-ray bursts are thought to be caused by a subset of exploding
Wolf-Rayet stars. We argue that the circumstellar absorption lines in early
supernova and in gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra may allow us to determine
the main properties of the Wolf-Rayet star progenitors which can produce those
two events. To demonstrate this, we first simulate the hydrodynamic evolution
of the circumstellar medium around a 40 Msun star up to the time of the
supernova explosion. Knowledge of density, temperature and radial velocity of
the circumstellar matter as function of space and time allows us to compute the
column density in the line of sight to the centre of the nebula, as a function
of radial velocity, angle, and time. Our column density profiles indicate the
possible number, strengths, widths and velocities of absorption line components
in supernova and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra. Our example calculation
shows four distinct line features during the Wolf-Rayet stage, at about 0, 50,
150-700 and 2200 km/s, with only those of the lowest and highest velocity
present at all times. The 150-700 km/s feature decays rapidly as function of
time after the onset of the Wolf-Rayet stage. It consists of a variable number
of components, and, especially in its evolved stage, is depending strongly on
the particular line of sight. A comparison with absorption lines detected in
the afterglow of GRB 021004 suggests that the high velocity absorption
component in GRB 021004 may be attributed to the free streaming Wolf-Rayet
wind, which is consistent with the steep density drop indicated by the
afterglow light curve. The presence of the intermediate velocity components
implies that the duration of the Wolf-Rayet phase of the progenitor of GRB
021004 was much smaller than the average Wolf-Rayet life time.",2005-07-28T09:29:28Z
"AGN heating, thermal conduction and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in galaxy
  groups and clusters","(abridged) We investigate in detail the role of active galactic nuclei on the
physical state of the gas in galaxy groups and clusters, and the implications
for anisotropy in the CMB from Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. We include the effect
of thermal conduction, and find that the resulting profiles of temperature and
entropy are consistent with observations. Unlike previously proposed models,
our model predicts that isentropic cores are not an inevitable consequence of
preheating. The model also reproduces the observational trend for the density
profiles to flatten in lower mass systems. We deduce the energy E_agn required
to explain the entropy observations as a function of mass of groups and
clusters M_cl and show that E_agn is proportional to M_cl^alpha with alpha~1.5.
We demonstrate that the entropy measurements, in conjunction with our model,
can be translated into constraints on the cluster--black hole mass relation.
The inferred relation is nonlinear and has the form M_bh\propto M_cl^alpha.
This scaling is an analog and extension of a similar relation between the black
hole mass and the galactic halo mass that holds on smaller scales. We show that
the central decrement of the CMB temperature is reduced due to the enhanced
entropy of the ICM, and that the decrement predicted from the plausible range
of energy input from the AGN is consistent with available data of SZ decrement.
We show that AGN heating, combined with the observational constraints on
entropy, leads to suppression of higher multipole moments in the angular power
spectrum and we find that this effect is stronger than previously thought.",2005-08-04T02:04:18Z
"The Molecular Condensations Ahead of Herbig-Haro Objects. III. Radiative
  and dynamical perturbations of the HH 2 condensation","We have carried out an extensive observational study (from BIMA data) and
made a preliminary theoretical investigation of the molecular gas around HH2.
The molecular maps show a very complex morphological, kinematical and chemical
structure. The overall main conclusion of this work confirms the findings of
Paper I and II, by demonstrating that in addition to the strong photochemical
effects caused by penetration of the UV photons from HH2 into molecular cloud,
a range of complex radiative and dynamical interactions occur. Thus, despite
the apparent `quiescent' nature of the molecular cloud ahead of HH2, the
kinematical properties observed within the field of view suggest that it is
possibly being driven out by powerful winds from the VLA 1 protostar.",2005-04-15T13:41:58Z
"Two and a half years of GRB localizations with the INTEGRAL Burst Alert
  System","We review the results on Gamma-ray Bursts obtained during the first two and a
half years of operations of the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System (IBAS). In many
cases GRB coordinates have been distributed with an unprecedented combination
of accuracy (3 arcmin) and speed (20-30 s). The resulting rapid follow-ups at
other wavelengths, including sensitive XMM-Newton and Swift observations, have
led to several interesting results.",2005-06-09T12:11:44Z
Gravitational waves from remnants of ultraluminous X-ray sources,"Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with X-ray luminosities larger than the
Eddington luminosity of stellar mass objects may be powered by intermediate
mass black holes (IBHs) of masses Mbh~10^3Msun. If IBHs form in young dense
stellar clusters, they can be fed by Roche lobe overflow from a tidally
captured massive (Ms>10Msun) stellar companion. After the donor leaves the main
sequence it forms a compact remnant, which spirals in due to gravitational wave
(GW) emission. We show that space based detectors such as the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna are likely to detect several of these sources. GW
sources stemming from this scenario have small eccentricities which give
distinct GW signals. Detection of such a GW signal will unambiguously prove the
existence of IBHs, and support the hypothesis that some ULXs are powered by
IBHs with captured companions.",2005-06-08T20:03:02Z
TeV Gamma-Ray Observations of the Perseus Galaxy Cluster,"We report on observations of the Perseus cluster of galaxies using the 10 m
Whipple $\gamma$-ray telescope during the 2004-2005 observing season. We apply
a two dimensional analysis technique to allow us to scrutinize the cluster for
TeV emission. In this contribution we will first calculate flux upper limits on
TeV gamma-ray sources within the cluster. Second, we derive an upper limit on
the extended cluster emission. We then compare the flux upper limits with the
EGRET upper limit at 100 MeV and theoretical models.",2005-07-19T18:56:10Z
Is the `IR Coincidence' Just That?,"(Abridged) Motch (1985) suggested that in the hard state of GX 339-4 the soft
X-ray power-law extrapolated backward in energy agrees with the IR flux. Corbel
& Fender (2002) showed that the hard state radio power-law extrapolated forward
in energy meets the extrapolated X-ray power-law at an IR break, which was
explicitly observed twice in GX 339-4. This `IR coincidence' has been cited as
further evidence that a jet might make a significant contribution to the X-rays
in hard state systems. We explore this hypothesis with a series of simultaneous
radio/X-ray observations of GX 339-4, taken during its 1997, 1999, and 2002
hard states. We fit these spectra, in detector space, with a simple, but
remarkably successful, doubly broken power-law that requires an IR spectral
break. For these observations, the break position and the integrated radio/IR
flux have stronger dependences upon the X-rays than the simplest jet
predictions. If one allows for a softening of the X-ray power law with
increasing flux, then the jet model agrees with the correlation. We also find
evidence that the radio/X-ray fcorrelation previously observed in GX 339-4
shows a `parallel track' for the 2002 hard state. The slope of the 2002
correlation is consistent with prior observations; however, the radio amplitude
is reduced. We then examine the correlation in Cyg X-1 through the use of radio
data, obtained with the Ryle radio telescope, and RXTE data, from the ASM and
pointed observations. We again find evidence of `parallel tracks', and here
they are associated with `failed transitions' to the soft state. We also find
that for Cyg X-1 the radio flux is more fundamentally correlated with the hard
X-ray flux.",2005-03-16T02:40:09Z
Spiders in Lyot Coronagraphs,"In principle, suppression of on-axis stellar light by a coronagraph is easier
on an unobscured aperture telescope than on one with an obscured aperture.
Recent designs such as the apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph, the `band-limited'
Lyot coronagraph, and several variants of phase mask coronagraphs work best on
unobscured circular aperture telescopes. These designs are developed to enable
the discovery and characterization of nearby jovian or even terrestrial
exoplanets. All of today's major space-based and adaptive optics-equipped
ground based telescopes are obscured aperture systems, with a secondary mirror
held in place by secondary support `spider' vanes. The presence of a secondary
obscuration can be dealt with by ingenious coronagraph designs, but the spider
vanes themselves cause diffracted light that can hamper the search for jovian
exoplanets around nearby stars. We look at the problem of suppressing spider
vane diffraction in Lyot coronagraphs, including apodized pupil and
band-limited designs. We show how spider vane diffraction can be reduced
drastically, and in fact contained, in the final coronagraphic image, within
one resolution element of the geometric image of the focal plane mask's
occulting spot. This makes adaptive optics coronagraphic searches for
exojupiters possible on the next generation of adaptive optics systems being
developed for 8-10 m class telescopes such as Gemini and the Very Large
Telescopes.",2005-06-23T16:01:53Z
An X-ray Galaxy Cluster Survey for Investigations of Dark Energy,"The amount and nature of dark energy (DE) can be tightly constrained by
measuring the spatial correlation features and evolution of a sample of ~
100,000 galaxy clusters over the redshift range 0<z < 1.5. Such an X-ray survey
will discover all collapsed structures with mass above 3.5e14 solar masss at
redshifts z<2 (i.e. the full range where such objects are expected) in the high
Galactic latitude sky. Above this mass threshold the tight correlations between
X-ray observables and mass allow direct interpretation of the data. We describe
the constraints on Dark Energy that can be inferred from such a survey, using
powerful self-calibration techniques to relate the X-ray observables
(luminosity and temperature) to the underlying mass.",2005-07-01T03:16:02Z
"Magnetic White Dwarfs from the SDSS II. The Second and Third Data
  Releases","Fifty-two magnetic white dwarfs have been identified in spectroscopic
observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) obtained between mid-2002
and the end of 2004, including Data Releases 2 and 3. Though not as numerous
nor as diverse as the discoveries from the first Data Release, the collection
exhibits polar field strengths ranging from 1.5MG to ~1000MG, and includes two
new unusual atomic DQA examples, a molecular DQ, and five stars that show
hydrogen in fields above 500MG. The highest-field example, SDSSJ2346+3853, may
be the most strongly magnetic white dwarf yet discovered. Analysis of the
photometric data indicates that the magnetic sample spans the same temperature
range as for nonmagnetic white dwarfs from the SDSS, and support is found for
previous claims that magnetic white dwarfs tend to have larger masses than
their nonmagnetic counterparts. A glaring exception to this trend is the
apparently low-gravity object SDSSJ0933+1022, which may have a history
involving a close binary companion.",2005-05-04T23:36:41Z
"Time-resolved FUSE Photometric and Spectroscopic Observations:
  PG1219+534, PG1605+072, and PG1613+426","We report on the detection of pulsations in the far ultraviolet (hereafter
FUV) light curves of PG1219+534, PG1605+072, and PG1613+426 obtained with the
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) in time-tagged mode (TTAG).
Exposures of the order of a few Ksecs were sufficient to observe the main
frequencies of PG1219+534 and PG1605+072 and confirm the detection of a
pulsation mode at the surface of PG1613+426 as reported from ground. For the
first time we derive time-resolved spectroscopic FUSE data of a sdB pulsator
(PG1605+072) and comment its line profile variation diagram (hereafter lpv
diagram). We observe the phase shift between the maximum luminosity and the
maximum radius to be consistent with the model of an adiabatic pulsator. We
also present evidence that the line broadening previously reported is not
caused by rotation but is rather an observational bias due to the rapid Doppler
shift of the lines with 17 km.s-1 amplitude. Thus our observations do not
support the previous claim that PG1605+072 is (or will evolve into) an
unusually fast rotating degenerate dwarf. These results demonstrate the
asteroseismological potential of the FUSE satellite which should be viewed as
another powerful means of investigation of stellar pulsations along with the
MOST and COROT missions.",2005-06-27T14:30:07Z
Why Are Radio-Galaxies Prolific Producers of Type Ia Supernovae?,"An analysis of SNIa events in early type galaxies from the Cappellaro et al
(1999) database provides conclusive evidence that the rate of type Ia
Supernovae (SNe) in radio-loud galaxies is about 4 times higher than the rate
measured in radio-quiet galaxies, i.e. SNIa-rate$(radio-loud galaxies) =
0.43^{+0.19}_{-0.14}h^2_{75}$ SNu as compared to SNIa-rate$(radio-quiet
galaxies) = 0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.03}h^2_{75}$ SNu. The actual value of the
enhancement is likely to be in the range $\sim 2-7$ (P$\sim 10^{-4}$). This
finding puts on robust empirical grounds the results obtained by Della Valle &
Panagia (2003) on the basis of a smaller sample of SNe. We analyse the possible
causes of this result and conclude that the enhancement of SNIa explosion rate
in radio-loud galaxies has the same origin as their being strong radio sources,
but there is no causality link between the two phenomena. We argue that
repeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of early type galaxies with
dwarf companions, on times-scale of about 1 Gyr, are responsible for inducing
both strong radio activity observed in $\sim$14% of early type galaxies and to
supply an adequate number of SNIa progenitors to the stellar population of
ellipticals.",2005-04-04T21:45:31Z
"Inhomogeneous distribution of mercury on the surfaces of rapidly
  rotating HgMn stars","Starspots are usually associated with the action of magnetic fields at the
stellar surfaces. However, recently an inhomogeneous chemical distribution of
mercury was found for the mercury-manganese (HgMn) star alpha And -- a
well-established member of a non-magnetic subclass of the chemically peculiar
stars of the upper main sequence. In this study we present first results of the
high-resolution survey of the HgII 3984 resonance line in the spectra of
rapidly rotating HgMn stars with atmospheric parameters similar to those of
alpha And. We use spectrum synthesis modelling and take advantage of the
Doppler resolution of the stellar surfaces to probe horizontal structure of
mercury distribution. Clear signatures of spots are found in the HgII 3984 line
profiles of HR 1185 and HR 8723. Two observations of the latter star separated
by two days give evidence for the line profile variability. We conclude that
inhomogeneous distribution of Hg is a common phenomenon for the rapidly
rotating HgMn stars in the 13000--13800 K effective temperature range
independently of the stellar evolutionary stage. These results establish
existence of a new class of spectrum variable spotted B-type stars. It is
suggested that the observed Hg inhomogeneities arise from dynamical
instabilities in the chemical diffusion processes and are unrelated to magnetic
phenomena.",2005-05-06T12:38:52Z
"An application of Green-function methods to gravitational radiation
  theory","Previous work in the literature has studied gravitational radiation in
black-hole collisions at the speed of light. In particular, it had been proved
that the perturbative field equations may all be reduced to equations in only
two independent variables, by virtue of a conformal symmetry at each order in
perturbation theory. The Green function for the perturbative field equations is
here analyzed by studying the corresponding second-order hyperbolic operator
with variable coefficients, instead of using the reduction method from the
retarded flat-space Green function in four dimensions. After reduction to
canonical form of this hyperbolic operator, the integral representation of the
solution in terms of the Riemann function is obtained. The Riemann function
solves a characteristic initial-value problem for which analytic formulae
leading to the numerical solution are derived.",2005-04-27T13:53:33Z
Non-leptonic Weak Interaction in Magnetized Quark matter,"We investigated the non-leptonic weak interaction in magnetic field.
  We discussed an improvement of previous method to analytical work out the
rate for weak field case.Our result easily goes over to field-free limit.Then
we calculated the reaction rate in strong magnetic field where the charged
particles are confined to the lowest Landau level. A strong magnetic field
strongly suppressed the rate,which will be foreseen to affect viscous dynamics
in SQM .We also derived a few approximation formulae under given conditions
that can be conveniently applied.",2005-07-17T09:42:51Z
A Search For Organic Molecules in Intermediate Redshift DLAs,"There has been a renewed interest in searching for diffuse interstellar bands
(DIBs) due to their probable connection to organic molecules and, thus, their
possible link to life in the Universe. Our group is undertaking an extensive
search for DIBs in DLAs via QSO absorption-line systems. Six of our DLA targets
are presented here. Our equivalent width (EW) limits for the 5780 DIB line
strongly suggests that DIB abundance is below the Milky Way expected value or
that metallicity plays a large role in DIB strengths.",2005-05-10T22:05:52Z
Radial and 2D Colour Properties of E+A Galaxies,"We investigated the radial colour gradient and two-dimensional (2D) colour
properties of 22 E+A galaxies with 5.5 < Hdelta equivalent width(EW) < 8.5\AA
and 49 normal early-type galaxies as a control sample at a redshift of <0.2 in
the Second Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We found that a
substantial number of E+A galaxies exhibit positive slopes of radial colour
gradient (bluer gradients toward the centre) which are seldom seen in normal
early-type galaxies. We found irregular 'colour morphologies'-- asymmetrical
and clumpy patterns -- at the centre of g-r and r-i 2D colour maps of E+A
galaxies with positive slopes of colour gradient. Kolomogorov-Smirnov
two-sample tests show that g-r and r-i colour gradient distributions of E+A
galaxies differ from those of early-type galaxies with a more than 99.99 per
cent significance level. We also found a tight correlation between radial
colour gradients and colours, and between radial colour gradients and the
4000-\AA break in the E+A sample; E+A galaxies which exhibit bluer colour or
weaker D4000 tend to have positive slopes of radial colour gradient. We
compared the GISSEL model and E+A observational quantities, Hdelta EW, D4000
and u-g colour, and found that almost all our E+A galaxies are situated along a
single evolutionary track. Therefore, these results are interpreted as E+A
galaxies evolving from Hdelta EW ~ 8 \AA to Hdelta EW ~ 5 \AA, with colour
gradients changing from positive to negative, and with the irregular 2D colour
map becoming smoother, during a time-scale of ~300 Myr. Our results favour the
hypothesis that E+A galaxies are post-starburst galaxies caused by
merger/interaction, having undergone a centralized violent starburst.",2005-07-05T13:53:17Z
Topological signatures in CMB temperature anisotropy maps,"We propose an alternative formalism to simulate CMB temperature maps in
$\Lambda$CDM universes with nontrivial spatial topologies. This formalism
avoids the need to explicitly compute the eigenmodes of the Laplacian operator
in the spatial sections. Instead, the covariance matrix of the coefficients of
the spherical harmonic decomposition of the temperature anisotropies is
expressed in terms of the elements of the covering group of the space. We
obtain a decomposition of the correlation matrix that isolates the topological
contribution to the CMB temperature anisotropies out of the simply connected
contribution. A further decomposition of the topological signature of the
correlation matrix for an arbitrary topology allows us to compute it in terms
of correlation matrices corresponding to simpler topologies, for which closed
quadrature formulae might be derived. We also use this decomposition to show
that CMB temperature maps of (not too large) multiply connected universes must
show ``patterns of alignment'', and propose a method to look for these
patterns, thus opening the door to the development of new methods for detecting
the topology of our Universe even when the injectivity radius of space is
slightly larger than the radius of the last scattering surface. We illustrate
all these features with the simplest examples, those of flat homogeneous
manifolds, i.e., tori, with special attention given to the cylinder, i.e.,
$T^1$ topology.",2005-07-11T02:24:24Z
"SDSS J124058.03-015919.2: A new AM CVn star with a 37-minute orbital
  period","We present high time resolution VLT spectroscopy of SDSS J124058.03-015919.2,
a new helium-transferring binary star identified in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. We measure an orbital period of 37.355+/-0.002 minutes, confirming the
AM CVn nature of the system. From the velocity amplitudes of the accretor and
the accretion stream--disc impact, we derive a mass ratio q=0.039+/-0.010. Our
spectral coverage extends from 3700A--9500A and shows the presence of helium,
nitrogen, silicon and iron in the accretion disc, plus the redshifted,
low-velocity ""central spikes"" in the helium lines, known from the low-state AM
CVn stars GP Com and CE 315. Doppler tomography of the helium and silicon
emission lines reveals an unusual pattern of two bright emission sites in the
tomograms, instead of the usual one emission site identified with the impact of
the mass stream into the accretion disc. One of the two is preferred as the
conventional stream--disc impact point in velocity space, at the 3-sigma
confidence level. We speculate briefly on the origin of the second.",2005-05-17T21:17:47Z
Unstable quasi g-modes in rotating main-sequence stars,"This paper studies the oscillatory stability of uniformly rotating
main-sequence stars of mass 3-8 M_sun by solving the linearized non-adiabatic,
non-radial oscillation equations with a forcing term and searching for resonant
response to a complex forcing frequency. By using the traditional approximation
the solution of the forced oscillation equations becomes separable, whereby the
energy equation is made separable by approximation. It is found that the
kappa-mechanism in rotating B-stars can destabilize not only gravity- or
pressure modes, but also a branch of low frequency retrograde (in corotating
frame) oscillations in between the retrograde g-modes and toroidal r-modes.
These unstable quasi g-modes (or `q-modes') hardly exhibit rotational
confinement to the equatorial regions of the star, while the oscillations are
always prograde in the observer's frame, all in contrast to g-modes. The
unstable q-modes occur in a few narrow period bands (defined by their azimuthal
index m), and seem to fit the oscillation spectra observed in SPB stars rather
well. The unstable q-mode oscillation spectrum of a very rapidly rotating 8
M_sun star appears similar to that of the well studied Be-star mu Cen. The
unstable q-modes thus seem far better in explaining the observed oscillation
spectra in SPB-stars and Be-stars than normal g-modes.",2005-06-07T21:18:13Z
On the distribution of collisionless particles in local potential well,"The distribution of collisionless particles with infinite motion in the
presence of a local potential well is discussed. Such distribution is important
for interpretation of results of dark matter searches. The relationship
n/v=const, where n and v are respectively number density and velocity of
particles, is derived for particles crossing a local potential well. The limits
of application of this relationship are specified.",2005-04-08T21:51:12Z
Clustered Massive Star Formation in Molecular Clouds,"I review some important questions in the field of massive star formation:
What are the initial conditions for proto star clusters and how do they arise?
What are the initial conditions for individual massive star formation within
star clusters? How do massive protostars accumulate their mass? I compare the
Turbulent Core Model (McKee & Tan 2003) to several nearby regions, including
Orion KL. Here I also discuss the origin of BN's high proper motion.",2005-07-05T20:33:38Z
"Pulsation and evolutionary masses of classical Cepheids. I. Milky Way
  variables","We investigate a selected sample of Galactic classical Cepheids with
available distance and reddening estimates in the framework of the theoretical
scenario provided by pulsation models, computed with metal abundance Z=0.02,
helium content in the range of Y=0.25 to 0.31, and various choices of the
stellar mass and luminosity. After transforming the bolometric light curve of
the fundamental models into BVRIJK magnitudes, we derived analytical relations
connecting the pulsation period with the stellar mass, the mean
(intensity-averaged) absolute magnitude, and the color of the pulsators. These
relations are used together with the Cepheid observed absolute magnitudes in
order to determine the ""pulsation"" mass -M_p- of each individual variable. The
comparison with the ""evolutionary"" masses -M_(e,can)- given by canonical (no
convective core overshooting, no mass-loss) models of central He-burning
stellar structures reveals that the M_p/M_(e,can) ratio is correlated with the
Cepheid period, ranging from about 0.8 at logP=0.5 to about 1 at logP=1.5. We
discuss the effects of different input physics and/or assumptions on the
evolutionary computations, as well as of uncertainties in the adopted Cepheid
metal content, distance, and reddening. Eventually, we find that the
pulsational results can be interpreted in terms of mass-loss during or before
the Cepheid phase, whose amount increases as the Cepheid original mass
decreases. It vanishes around 13M_(sun) and increases up to about 20% at
4M_(sun).",2005-05-08T10:11:58Z
Simulating galaxy clusters : the ICM and the galaxy populations,"Cosmological LambdaCDM TreeSPH simulations of the formation and evolution of
galaxy groups and clusters have been performed. The simulations include: star
formation, chemical evolution with non-instantaneous recycling, metal dependent
radiative cooling, strong star burst and (optionally) AGN driven galactic super
winds, effects of a meta-galactic UV field and thermal conduction. We report
results on the temperature and entropy profiles of the ICM, the X-ray
luminosity, cold fraction, M/L and IMLR ratios in gas and stars, metal
abundances and gradients. Besides, the properties of the galaxy populations in
the two richest clusters are discussed: global star formation rates of the
cluster galaxies, the total K-band luminosity, the galaxy luminosity functions
at z=0 and their redshift evolution, the colour-magnitude relation (``red
sequence'') as resulting from metallicity effects, and the role of the IMF in
reproducing colours and abundances of the stellar populations. Finally the
contribute (20-40 %) to cluster light from the intra-cluster stars and the cD
galaxy has been investigated: surface brightness profiles, mean colours and
chemical abundances, kinematics (velocity dispersion and distributions) of the
IC stellar populations.",2005-04-15T13:44:59Z
Grid services for the MAGIC experiment,"Exploring signals from the outer space has become an observational science
under fast expansion. On the basis of its advanced technology the MAGIC
telescope is the natural building block for the first large scale ground based
high energy gamma-ray observatory. The low energy threshold for gamma-rays
together with different background sources leads to a considerable amount of
data. The analysis will be done in different institutes spread over Europe.
Therefore MAGIC offers the opportunity to use the Grid technology to setup a
distributed computational and data intensive analysis system with the nowadays
available technology. Benefits of Grid computing for the MAGIC telescope are
presented.",2005-03-24T14:56:31Z
Evolving turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters,"We discuss, using simple analytical models and MHD simulations, the origin
and parameters of turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Three
physically distinct regimes can be identified in the evolution of cluster
turbulence and magnetic fields. Firstly, the fluctuation dynamo will produce
microgauss-strong, random magnetic fields during cluster formation and major
mergers. Turbulent velocity of about 300 km/s can be maintained at scales
100-200 kpc. The magnetic field is intermittent, has a smaller scale of 20-30
kpc and average strength of 2 microgauss. Secondly, when major mergers end,
turbulent speed and magnetic field undergo a power-law decay, decreasing in
strength but increasing in scale by a factor of about two. Thirdly,
smaller-mass subclusters and cluster galaxies produce turbulent wakes, with
turbulent speeds and magnetic field strengths similar to those quoted above.
The velocity scales are about 200 kpc and 10 kpc respectively, and the magnetic
field scale is about 6 times smaller. Although these wakes may fill only a
small fraction of the cluster volume, their area covering factor can be close
to unity. So one can potentially reconcile observations that indicate the
coexistence of turbulence with ordered filamentary gas structures, as in the
Perseus cluster. Random Faraday rotation measure is estimated to be typically
100-200 rad/m^2, in agreement with observations. We predict detectable
synchrotron polarization from cluster radio halos at wavelengths 3-6 cm, if
observed at sufficiently high resolution (abridged).",2005-05-07T18:07:23Z
Cosmic Mimicry: Is LCDM a Braneworld in Disguise ?,"For a broad range of parameter values, braneworld models display a remarkable
property which we call cosmic mimicry. Cosmic mimicry is characterized by the
fact that, at low redshifts, the Hubble parameter in the braneworld model is
virtually indistinguishable from that in the LCDM cosmology. An important point
to note is that the \Omega_m parameters in the braneworld model and in the LCDM
cosmology can nevertheless be quite different. Thus, at high redshifts (early
times), the braneworld asymptotically expands like a matter-dominated universe
with the value of \Omega_m inferred from the observations of the local matter
density. At low redshifts (late times), the braneworld model behaves almost
exactly like the LCDM model but with a renormalized value of the cosmological
density parameter \Omega_m^{LCDM}. The redshift which characterizes cosmic
mimicry is related to the parameters in the higher-dimensional braneworld
Lagrangian. Cosmic mimicry is a natural consequence of the scale-dependence of
gravity in braneworld models. The change in the value of the cosmological
density parameter is shown to be related to the spatial dependence of the
effective gravitational constant in braneworld theory. A subclass of mimicry
models lead to an older age of the universe and also predict a redshift of
reionization which is lower than z_{reion} \simeq 17 in the LCDM cosmology.
These models might therefore provide a background cosmology which is in better
agreement both with the observed quasar abundance at z \gsim 4 and with the
large optical depth to reionization measured by the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe.",2005-04-30T06:53:11Z
"Fully Threaded Transport Engine: New Method for Multi-Scale Radiative
  Transfer","A new, very fast method for 3D radiative transfer on fully threaded grids
with arbitrarily high angular resolution is presented. The method uses
completely cell-based discretization, and is ideally suited for problems with
diffuse background radiation, often encountered in cosmological and star
formation models. We find that for accurate statistical study of intergalactic
Ly-alpha absorption lines one needs of order of few hundred angular
discretization elements even for models without radiative feedback from star
forming galaxies.",2005-05-09T19:27:02Z
Numerical self-consistent stellar models of thin disks,"We find a numerical self-consistent stellar model by finding the distribution
function of a thin disk that satisfies simultaneously the Fokker-Planck and
Poisson equations. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is found by a
direct numerical solver using finite differences and a variation of Stone's
method. The collision term in the Fokker-Planck equation is found using the
local approximation and the Rosenbluth potentials. The resulting diffusion
coefficients are explicitly evaluated using a Maxwellian distribution for the
field stars. As a paradigmatic example, we apply the numerical formalism to
find the distribution function of a Kuzmin-Toomre thin disk. This example is
studied in some detail showing that the method applies to a large family of
actual galaxies.",2005-05-12T20:02:33Z
"Discovery of a Galaxy Cluster in the Foreground of the Wide-Separation
  Quasar Pair UM425","We report the discovery of a cluster of galaxies in the field of UM425, a
pair of quasars separated by 6.5arcsec. Based on this finding, we revisit the
long-standing question of whether this quasar pair is a binary quasar or a
wide-separation lens. Previous work has shown that both quasars are at z=1.465
and show broad absorption lines. No evidence for a lensing galaxy has been
found between the quasars, but there were two hints of a foreground cluster:
diffuse X-ray emission observed with Chandra, and an excess of faint galaxies
observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we show, via VLT spectroscopy,
that there is a spike in the redshift histogram of galaxies at z=0.77. We
estimate the chance of finding a random velocity structure of such significance
to be about 5%, and thereby interpret the diffuse X-ray emission as originating
from z=0.77, rather than the quasar redshift. The mass of the cluster, as
estimated from either the velocity dispersion of the z=0.77 galaxies or the
X-ray luminosity of the diffuse emission, would be consistent with the
theoretical mass required for gravitational lensing. The positional offset
between the X-ray centroid and the expected location of the mass centroid is
about 40kpc, which is not too different from offsets observed in lower redshift
clusters. However, UM425 would be an unusual gravitational lens, by virtue of
the absence of a bright primary lensing galaxy. Unless the mass-to-light ratio
of the galaxy is at least 80 times larger than usual, the lensing hypothesis
requires that the galaxy group or cluster plays a uniquely important role in
producing the observed deflections.
  Based on observations performed with the Very Large Telescope at the European
Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile.",2005-05-12T10:35:16Z
"Central Blue Clumps in Elliptical Galaxies of the Hubble Ultra Deep
  Field","Elliptical galaxies larger than 10 pixels in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
(UDF) were surveyed for internal structure; 30 out of 100 in a sample of 884
morphologically classified galaxies exhibit large blue clumps near their
centers. Unsharp-masked images of the best cases are presented. The
distributions of the clumps on color-color and color-magnitude diagrams are
about the same as the distributions of isolated objects in the UDF field with
the same size, suggesting a possible accretion origin. In the few cases where
redshifts are published, the clump masses and star-formation ages were
determined from stellar evolution models, as were the galaxy masses. The clump
mass scales with galaxy mass, probably because of selection effects, and ranges
from 10^6 Msun to 10^8 Msun for galaxies with masses from 10^{9} Msun to
10^{11} Msun. The clump star formation age ranges between 10^7 yr and 2x10^8
yr. With partial evaporation and core contraction in the intervening years,
some of these clumps could resemble globular clusters today. Stars that
evaporate will contribute to the field population in the elliptical galaxy.",2005-04-01T18:33:09Z
Once-ionized helium in superstrong magnetic fields,"It is generally believed that magnetic fields of some neutron stars, the
so-called magnetars, are enormously strong, up to 10^{14} - 10^{15} G. Recent
investigations have shown that the atmospheres of magnetars are possibly
composed of helium. We calculate the structure and bound-bound radiative
transitions of the He^+ ion in superstrong fields, including the effects caused
by the coupling of the ion's internal degrees of freedom to its center-of-mass
motion. We show that He^+ in superstrong magnetic fields can produce spectral
lines with energies of up to about 3 keV, and it may be responsible for
absorption features detected recently in the soft X-ray spectra of several
radio-quiet isolated neutron stars. Quantization of the ion's motion across a
magnetic field results in a fine structure of spectral lines, with a typical
spacing of tens electron-volts in magnetar-scale fields. It also gives rise to
ion cyclotron transitions, whose energies and oscillator strengths depend on
the state of the bound ion.",2005-05-23T00:04:38Z
GRB990123: multiwavelength afterglow study,"We report on the BeppoSAX and multiwavelength data analysis of the afterglow
of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 990123. Mainly due to its exceptional brightness, this
is the only source for which the Wide Field Cameras have allowed an early
detection of the X-ray afterglow between about 20 and 60 min after the GRB
trigger. Besides, again for the first time, high-energy emission from the
afterglow was detected up to 60 keV. The backwards extrapolation of the
afterglow decay smoothly reconnects with the late GRB emission, thus indicating
that both are consistent with being produced by the same phenomenon. For the
X-ray afterglow we found a power-law decay with index alpha_X = 1.46 +/- 0.04;
the spectrum has a power-law shape with photon index Gamma about 2. An
extensive set of multiwavelength observations on the afterglow, collected from
the literature and made during the BeppoSAX pointing, allowed constructing a
Spectral Flux Distribution. We performed an analysis of the GRB afterglow
emission in the context of the ""fireball"" model.",2005-05-02T16:18:20Z
"Mass-loss and Recent Spectral Changes in the Yellow Hypergiant Rho
  Cassiopeiae","The yellow hypergiant Rho Cassiopeiae (F-G Ia0) has recently become very
active with a tremendous outburst event in the fall of 2000. During the event
the pulsating supergiant dimmed by more than a visual magnitude, while its
effective temperature decreased from 7000 K to below 4000 K over about 200 d,
and we directly observed the largest mass-loss rate of about 5% of the solar
mass in a single stellar outburst so far. Over the past three years since the
eruption we observed a very prominent inverse P Cygni profile in Balmer H
alpha, signaling a strong collapse of the upper atmosphere, also observed
before the 2000 event. Continuous spectroscopic monitoring reveals that the H
alpha line profile has transformed into a P Cygni profile since June 2003,
presently (Sept 2004) signaling supersonic expansion velocities up to ~120 km/s
in the extended upper atmosphere.
  Based on the very recent unique spectral evolution we observed the far-UV
spectrum with the FUSE satellite in July 2004. The FUSE spectrum reveals that
high-temperature plasma emission lines of O VI and C III are absent in the
hypergiant, also observed for the red supergiant Alpha Ori (M2 Iab). On the
other hand, we observe prominent transition region emission lines in the
smaller (less luminous) classical Cepheid variable Beta Dor (F-G Iab-Ia),
indicating that the mean atmospheric extension and surface gravity acceleration
(as compared to effective temperature and atmospheric pulsation) play a major
role for the formation of high-temperature stellar atmospheric plasmas. We
present an overview of the recent spectral variability phases of Rho Cas with
enhanced mass-loss from this enigmatic cool star.",2005-04-24T01:54:24Z

"Three-dimensional MHD simulations of X-ray emitting subcluster plasmas
  in cluster of galaxies","Recent high resolution observations by the {\it Chandra} X-ray satellite
revealed various substructures in hot X-ray emitting plasmas in cluster of
galaxies. For example, {\it Chandra} revealed the existence of sharp
discontinuities in the surface brightness at the leading edge of subclusters in
merging clusters (e.g., Abell 3667), where the temperature drops sharply across
the fronts. These sharp edges are called cold fronts. We present results of
three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the interaction
between a dense subcluster plasma and ambient magnetized intracluster medium.
Anisotropic heat conduction along magnetic field lines is included. At the
initial state, magnetic fields are assumed to be uniform and transverse to the
motion of the dense subcluster. Since magnetic fields ahead of the subcluster
slip toward the third direction in the 3D case, the strength of magnetic fields
in this region can be reduced compared to that in the 2D case. Nevertheless, a
cold front can be maintained because the magnetic field lines wrapping around
the forehead of the subcluster suppress the heat conduction across them. On the
other hand, when the magnetic field is absent, a cold front cannot be
maintained because isotropic heat conduction from the hot ambient plasma
rapidly heats the cold subcluster plasma.",2005-04-09T20:17:50Z
"Differential rotation and meridional flow in the solar convection zone
  and beneath","The influence of the basic rotation on anisotropic and inhomogeneous
turbulence is discussed in the context of differential rotation theory. An
improved representation for the original turbulence leads to a $\Lam$-effect
which complies with the results of 3D numerical simulations. The resulting
rotation law and meridional flow agree well with both the surface observations
($\partial\Om/\partial r<0$ and meridional flow towards the poles) and with the
findings of helioseismology. The computed equatorward flow at the bottom of
convection zone has an amplitude of about 10 m/s and may be significant for the
solar dynamo. The depth of the meridional flow penetration into the radiative
zone is proportional to $\nu^{0.5}_\mathrm{core}$, where $\nu_\mathrm{core}$ is
the viscosity beneath the convection zone. The penetration is very small if the
tachocline is laminar.",2005-06-10T14:46:32Z
"Cosmological parameters from combined second- and third-order aperture
  mass statistics of cosmic shear","We present predictions for cosmological parameter constraints from combined
measurements of second- and third-order statistics of cosmic shear. We define
the generalized third-order aperture mass statistics <M_ap^3> and show that it
contains much more information about the bispectrum of the projected matter
density than the skewness of the aperture mass. From theoretical models as well
as from LCDM ray-tracing simulations, we calculate <M_ap^2> and <M_ap^3> and
their dependence on cosmological parameters. The covariances including shot
noise and cosmic variance of M_ap^2, M_ap^3 and their cross-correlation are
calculated using ray-tracing simulations. We perform an extensive Fisher matrix
analysis, and for various combinations of cosmological parameters, we predict
1-sigma-errors corresponding to measurements from a deep 29 square degree
cosmic shear survey. Although the parameter degeneracies can not be lifted
completely, the (linear) combination of second- and third-order aperture mass
statistics reduces the errors significantly. The strong degeneracy between
Omega_m and sigma_8, present for all second-order cosmic shear measures, is
diminished substantially, whereas less improvement is found for the
near-degenerate pair consisting of the shape parameter Gamma and the spectral
index n_s. Uncertainties in the source galaxy redshift z_0 increase the errors
of all other parameters.",2005-05-29T12:20:47Z
"Extinction properties of the X-ray bright/optically faint afterglow of
  GRB 020405","We present an optical-to-X-ray spectral analysis of the afterglow of GRB
020405. The optical spectral energy distribution not corrected for the
extragalactic extinction is significantly below the X-ray extrapolation of the
single powerlaw spectral model suggested by multiwavelength studies. We
investigate whether considerable extinction could explain the observed spectral
``mismatch'' by testing several types of extinction curves. For the first time
we test extinction curves computed with time-dependent numerical simulations of
dust grains destruction by the burst radiation. We find that an extinction law
weakly depen dent on wavelength can reconcile the unabsorbed optical and X-ray
data with the expected synchrotron spectrum. A gray extinction law can be
provided by a dust grain size distribution biased toward large grains.",2005-06-17T13:34:40Z
Mirror World and Axion: Relaxing Cosmological Bounds,"The cosmological (upper) limit on the Peccei-Quinn constant, related to the
primordial oscillations of the axion field, can be relaxed for a mirror axion
model. The simple reason is that the mirror world is colder and so the behavior
of the axion temperature-dependent mass is dominated by the contribution from
the mirror sector. So the coherent oscillations start earlier and
correspondingly the axion mass density \Omega_a h^2 is reduced.",2005-04-28T16:14:46Z
"Simulating the joint evolution of quasars, galaxies and their
  large-scale distribution","The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical paradigm for
the formation of structure in the Universe. Together with the theory of cosmic
inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for
structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through
gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise
measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally
precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the
quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest
simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new
techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components.
We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe
are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an
effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next
generation surveys.",2005-04-05T07:08:11Z
"The intermediate-age open clusters Ruprecht 4, Ruprecht 7 and Pismis 15","We report on $BVI$ CCD photometry to $V=22.0$ for 3 fields centered on the
region of the Galactic star clusters Ruprecht~4, Ruprecht~7 and Pismis~15 and
on 3 displaced control fields. Ruprecht~4 and Pismis~15 have never been studied
before, and we provide for the first time estimates of their fundamental
parameters, namely, radial extent, age, distance and reddening. Ruprecht~7
(Berkeley~33) however was studied by Mazur et al. (1993). We find that the
three clusters are all of intermediate age (0.8-1.3 Gyr), and with a
metallicity close to or lower than solar.",2005-03-24T18:06:26Z
Low Luminosity Companions to White Dwarfs,"This paper presents results of a near-infrared imaging survey for low mass
stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs. A wide field proper motion
survey of 261 white dwarfs was capable of directly detecting companions at
orbital separations between $\sim100$ and 5000 AU with masses as low as 0.05
$M_{\odot}$, while a deep near field search of 86 white dwarfs was capable of
directly detecting companions at separations between $\sim50$ and 1100 AU with
masses as low as 0.02 $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, all white dwarf targets were
examined for near-infrared excess emission, a technique capable of detecting
companions at arbitrarily close separations down to masses of 0.05 $M_{\odot}$.
  No brown dwarf candidates were detected, which implies a brown dwarf
companion fraction of $<0.5$% for white dwarfs. In contrast, the stellar
companion fraction of white dwarfs as measured by this survey is 22%,
uncorrected for bias. Moreover, most of the known and suspected stellar
companions to white dwarfs are low mass stars whose masses are only slightly
greater than the masses of brown dwarfs. Twenty previously unknown stellar
companions were detected, five of which are confirmed or likely white dwarfs
themselves, while fifteen are confirmed or likely low mass stars.
  Similar to the distribution of cool field dwarfs as a function of spectral
type, the number of cool unevolved dwarf companions peaks at mid-M type. Based
on the present work, relative to this peak, field L dwarfs appear to be roughly
2-3 times more abundant than companion L dwarfs. Additionally, there is no
evidence that the initial companion masses have been altered by post main
sequence binary interactions.",2005-06-01T13:02:54Z
"First results from the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey: Constraints
  on the z=6 quasar luminosity function and the quasar contribution to
  reionization","We present preliminary results of a new quasar survey being undertaken with
multi-colour optical imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The
current data consists of 3.83 sq. deg. of imaging in the i' and z' filters to a
10 sigma limit of z'<23.35. Near-infrared photometry of 24 candidate 5.7<z<6.4
quasars confirms them all to be low mass stars including two T dwarfs and four
or five L dwarfs. Photometric estimates of the spectral type of the two T
dwarfs are T3 and T6. We use the lack of high-redshift quasars in this survey
volume to constrain the z=6 quasar luminosity function. For reasonable values
of the break absolute magnitude M*_1450 and faint-end slope alpha, we determine
that the bright-end slope beta>-3.2 at 95% confidence. We find that the
comoving space-density of quasars brighter than M_1450=-23.5 declines by a
factor >25 from z=2 to z=6, mirroring the decline observed for high-luminosity
quasars. We consider the contribution of the quasar population to the ionizing
photon density at z=6 and the implications for reionization. We show that the
current constraints on the quasar population give an ionizing photon density
<<30% that of the star-forming galaxy population. We conclude that active
galactic nuclei make a negligible contribution to the reionization of hydrogen
at z~6.",2005-07-07T20:22:17Z
"Subaru HDS Transmission Spectroscopy of the Transiting Extrasolar Planet
  HD 209458b","We have searched for absorption in several common atomic species due to the
atmosphere or exosphere of the transiting extrasolar planet HD 209458b, using
high precision optical spectra obtained with the Subaru High Dispersion
Spectrograph (HDS). Previously we reported an upper limit on H alpha absorption
of 0.1% (3 sigma) within a 5.1\AA band. Using the same procedure, we now report
upper limits on absorption due to the optical transitions of Na D, Li, H alpha,
H beta, H gamma, Fe, and Ca. The 3 sigma upper limit for each transition is
approximately 1% within a 0.3\AA band (the core of the line), and a few tenths
of a per cent within a 2\AA band (the full line width). The wide-band results
are close to the expected limit due to photon-counting (Poisson) statistics,
although in the narrow-band case we have encountered unexplained systematic
errors at a few times the Poisson level. These results are consistent with all
previously reported detections and upper limits, but are significantly more
sensitive.",2005-04-25T14:46:50Z
Catalog of Galactic Beta Cephei Stars,"We present an extensive and up-to-date catalog of Galactic Beta Cephei stars.
This catalog is intended to give a comprehensive overview of observational
characteristics of all known Beta Cephei stars. 93 stars could be confirmed to
be Beta Cephei stars. For some stars we re-analyzed published data or conducted
our own analyses. 61 stars were rejected from the final Beta Cephei list, and
77 stars are suspected to be Beta Cephei stars. A list of critically selected
pulsation frequencies for confirmed Beta Cephei stars is also presented. We
analyze the Beta Cephei stars as a group, such as the distributions of their
spectral types, projected rotational velocities, radial velocities, pulsation
periods, and Galactic coordinates. We confirm that the majority of these stars
are multiperiodic pulsators. We show that, besides two exceptions, the Beta
Cephei stars with high pulsation amplitudes are slow rotators. We construct a
theoretical HR diagram that suggests that almost all 93 Beta Cephei stars are
MS objects. We discuss the observational boundaries of Beta Cephei pulsation
and their physical parameters. We corroborate that the excited pulsation modes
are near to the radial fundamental mode in frequency and we show that the mass
distribution of the stars peaks at 12 solar masses. We point out that the
theoretical instability strip of the Beta Cephei stars is filled neither at the
cool nor at the hot end and attempt to explain this observation.",2005-06-21T14:20:15Z
The Plerionic Supernova Remnant G21.5-0.9: In and Out,"The absence of a supernova remnant (SNR) shell surrounding the Crab and other
plerions (pulsar wind nebulae) has been a mystery for 3 decades. G21.5-0.9 is a
particularly intriguing plerionic SNR in which the central powering engine is
not yet detected. Early Chandra observations revealed a faint extended X-ray
halo which was suggested to be associated with the SNR shell; however its
spectrum was nonthermal, unlike what is expected from an SNR shell. On the
other hand, a plerionic origin to the halo is problematic since the X-ray
plerion would be larger than the radio plerion. We present here our analysis of
an integrated 245 ksec of archival Chandra data acquired with the
High-Resolution Camera (HRC) and 520 ksec acquired with the Advanced CCD
Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). This study provides the deepest and highest
resolution images obtained to date. The resulting images reveal for the first
time 1) a limb-brightened morphology in the eastern section of the halo, and 2)
a rich structure in the inner (40""-radius) bright plerion including wisps and a
double-lobed morphology with an axis of symmetry running in the
northwest-southeast direction. Our spatially resolved spectroscopic study of
the ACIS-I data indicates that the photon index steepens with increasing
distance from the central point source out to a radius of 40"" then becomes
constant at ~2.4 in the X-ray halo (for a column density N_H=2.2E22/cm^2). No
line emission was found from the eastern limb; however marginal evidence for
line emission in the halo's northern knots was found. This study illustrates
the need for deep Chandra observations to reveal the missing SNR material in
Crab-like plerions.",2005-04-17T22:59:42Z
Dual frequency VSOP imaging of the jet in S5 0836+710,"The luminous high-redshift (z=2.17) quasar S50836+710 has been observed in
October 1997 with the VSOP at 1.6 GHz and 5 GHz. We report here a previously
unpublished image made from the data at 1.6 GHz and compare the structure of a
relativistic jet in this quasazr at the two frequencies. We present a spectral
index image tracing spectral properties of the jet up to ~40 milliarcsecond
distance from the nucleus. The curved jet ridge line observed in the images and
the spectral index distribution can be described by Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability developing in a relativistic outflow with a Mach number of ~6. In
this description, the overall ridge line of the jet is formed by the helical
surface mode of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, while areas of flatter spectral
index embedded into the flow correspond to pressure enhancements produced by
the elliptical surface mode of the instability. An alternative explanation
involving a sequence of slowly dissipating shocks cannot be ruled out at this
point.",2005-07-28T15:00:12Z
The Swift X-ray Telescope,"The Swift Gamma-Ray Explorer is designed to make prompt multiwavelength
observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and GRB afterglows. The X-ray Telescope
(XRT) enables Swift to determine GRB positions with a few arcseconds accuracy
within 100 seconds of the burst onset.
  The XRT utilizes a mirror set built for JET-X and an XMM/EPIC MOS CCD
detector to provide a sensitive broad-band (0.2-10 keV) X-ray imager with
effective area of > 120 cm^2 at 1.5 keV, field of view of 23.6 x 23.6
arcminutes, and angular resolution of 18 arcseconds (HPD). The detection
sensitivity is 2x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in 10^4 seconds. The instrument is
designed to provide automated source detection and position reporting within 5
seconds of target acquisition. It can also measure the redshifts of GRBs with
Fe line emission or other spectral features. The XRT operates in an
auto-exposure mode, adjusting the CCD readout mode automatically to optimize
the science return for each frame as the source intensity fades. The XRT will
measure spectra and lightcurves of the GRB afterglow beginning about a minute
after the burst and will follow each burst for days or weeks.",2005-08-02T13:25:24Z
"Asteroseismology of the Beta Cephei star Nu Eridani -- IV. The 2003-4
  multisite photometric campaign and the combined 2002-4 data","The second multisite photometric campaign devoted to Nu Eri is reported. For
Nu Eri, analysis of the new data adds four independent frequencies to the nine
derived previously from the 2002-3 data, three in the range from 7.20 to 7.93
c/d, and a low one, equal to 0.614 c/d. Combining the new and the old data
results in two further independent frequencies, equal to 6.7322 and 6.2236 c/d.
Altogether, the oscillation spectrum is shown to consist of 12 high frequencies
and two low ones. The latter have u amplitudes about twice as large as the v
and y amplitudes, a signature of high radial-order g modes. Thus, the
suggestion that Nu Eri is both a Beta Cephei and an SPB star, put forward on
the basis of the first campaign's data, is confirmed.
  Nine of the 12 high frequencies form three triplets, of which two are new.
The triplets represent rotationally split l=1 modes, although in case of the
smallest-amplitude one this may be questioned. Mean separations and asymmetries
of the triplets are derived with accuracy sufficient for meaningful comparison
with models.
  The first comparison star, Mu Eri, is shown to be an SPB variable with an
oscillation spectrum consisting of six frequencies, three of which are
equidistant in period. The star is also found to be an eclipsing variable. The
eclipse is a transit, probably total, the secondary is fainter than the primary
by several magnitudes, and the system is widely detached.
  The second comparison star, Xi Eri, is confirmed to be a Delta Scuti
variable. To the frequency of 10.8742 c/d seen already in the first campaign's
data, another one, equal to 17.2524 c/d, is added.",2005-04-11T12:27:03Z
The MAGIC Telescope and the Observation of Gamma Ray Bursts,"The MAGIC Telescope, now taking data with an energy threshold well below 100
GeV, will soon be able to take full advantage of the fast slewing capability of
its altazimuthal mount. Exploiting the link with the GCN network, the MAGIC
Telescope could be one of the first ground-based experiments able to see the
prompt emission of Gamma Ray Bursts in the few tens of GeV region.",2005-04-14T00:38:13Z
"A Possible Late Time $Λ$CDM-like Background Cosmology in
  Relativistic MOND Theory","In the framework of Relativistic MOND theory (TeVeS), we show that a late
time background $\Lambda$CDM cosmology can be attained by choosing a specific
$F(\mu)$ that also meets the requirement for the existence of Newtonian and
MOND limits. We investigate the dynamics of the scalar field $\phi$ under our
chosen $F(\mu)$ and show that the ""slow roll"" regime of $\phi$ corresponds to a
dynamical attractor, where the whole system reduces to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.",2005-04-05T23:10:09Z
On the nature of nearby GRB/SN host galaxies,"We present and discuss optical diagnostics of the low redshift (z<0.2)
galaxies that are known to have hosted supernovae associated with gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). The three galaxies are all actively starforming sub-luminous
(L<L*) galaxies with relatively low metallicities (Z<Zsun). We find no evidence
for substantial internal extinction within any of the galaxies. We derive star
formation rates (SFR) based on H-alpha luminosities, as well as specific star
formation rates (SFFR, star formation rate per unit luminosity). For GRB 980425
(SN 1998bw) we use photometry of the supernova environment to estimate the mass
of the progentitor to > 30 Msun. These three host galaxies have global
properties (luminosities, SFR, SSFR, metallicity, colour, reddening) that
resemble those of more distant GRB host galaxies. We also compare the host
galaxies with a sample of Blue Compact Galaxies (BCGs) in the local universe,
and show that these samples have similar properties.",2005-06-28T08:16:30Z
"The Stochastic Effect of Ly-alpha absorbers on Broadband Luminosities of
  Galaxies","We investigate the variations of broadband luminosities of low and
intermediate redshift galaxies due to the stochastic nature of the neutral
hydrogen present in form of Ly-alpha absorbers in the intergalactic medium.
This effect is caused by variations in the distribution and properties
(redshift, column density, Doppler parameter) of the absorbers along different
lines-of-sight out to a given redshift. Using a set of observationally
constrained redshift-, column density- and Doppler parameter distributions we
perform Monte Carlo simulations for a large number of lines-of-sight towards
galaxies at a given redshift z and calculate attenuated FUV/NUV magnitudes and
corresponding 1-, 2- and 3-sigma variations. We predict significant variations
in luminosity ranging from -0.22 to +0.48 magnitudes at the 1-sigma level for
galaxies at z=1.5 in GALEX data.",2005-04-25T16:21:00Z
"Spiral waves and the secondary in the novalike variable, V3885 Sgr","We present seven nights' blue spectroscopy of the novalike variable star,
V3885 Sgr. The line spectrum shows a typical combination of broad absorption
and emission in H gamma and H beta and He I, which is associated with the
accretion disk. We also observe anti-phased narrow emission, which we attribute
to irradiation of the secondary star. The He II 4686 and N III--C III--C IV
emission lines are devoid of structure and are most likely formed in an
outflow. We measure radial velocity shifts in the absorption and emission
lines, from which we fit an orbital period of 4.97126+/-0.00036h. From the
velocity semi-amplitudes of the disk and companion star, we are able to
constrain the binary mass ratio to q>0.7.
  The phase-folded spectra provide dense coverage of the entire orbital cycle.
Doppler tomograms of the hydrogen and He I lines reveal spiral structure in the
accretion disk and the irradiated donor star. We believe this is the first
unambiguous detection of spiral waves in a novalike variable.",2005-07-21T02:20:51Z
Tracing Galaxy Formation with Stellar Halos I: Methods,"If the favored hierarchical cosmological model is correct, then the Milky Way
system should have accreted ~100-200 luminous satellite galaxies in the past
\~12 Gyr. We model this process using a hybrid semi-analytic plus N-body
approach which distinguishes explicitly between the evolution of light and dark
matter in accreted satellites. This distinction is essential to our ability to
produce a realistic stellar halo, with mass and density profile much like that
of our own Galaxy, and a surviving satellite population that matches the
observed number counts and structural parameter distributions of the satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way. Our model stellar halos have density profiles which
typically drop off with radius faster than those of the dark matter. They are
assembled from the inside out, with the majority of mass (~80%) coming from the
\~15 most massive accretion events. The satellites that contribute to the
stellar halo have median accretion times of ~9 Gyr in the past, while surviving
satellite systems have median accretion times of ~5 Gyr in the past. This
implies that stars associated with the inner halo should be quite different
chemically from stars in surviving satellites and also from stars in the outer
halo or those liberated in recent disruption events. We briefly discuss the
expected spatial structure and phase space structure for halos formed in this
manner. Searches for this type of structure offer a direct test of whether
cosmology is indeed hierarchical on small scales.",2005-06-20T19:53:57Z
"A Spectroscopic Search for the non-nuclear Wolf-Rayet Population of the
  metal-rich spiral galaxy M83","We present a catalogue of non-nuclear regions containing Wolf-Rayet stars in
the metal-rich spiral galaxy M83 (NGC5236). From a total of 283 candidate
regions identified using HeII 4686 imaging with VLT-FORS2, Multi Object
Spectroscopy of 198 regions was carried out, confirming 132 WR sources. From
this sub-sample, an exceptional content of 1035 +/- 300 WR stars is inferred,
with N(WC)/N(WN) approx 1.2, continuing the trend to larger values at higher
metallicity amongst Local Group galaxies, and greatly exceeding current
evolutionary predictions at high metallicity. Late-type stars dominate the WC
population of M83, with N(WC8-9)/N(WC4-7)=9 and WO subtypes absent, consistent
with metallicity dependent WC winds. Equal numbers of late to early WN stars
are observed, again in contrast to current evolutionary predictions. Several
sources contain large numbers of WR stars. In particular, #74 (alias region 35
from De Vaucouleurs et al. contains 230 WR stars, and is identified as a Super
Star Cluster from inspection of archival HST/ACS images. Omitting this
starburst cluster would result in revised statistics of N(WC)/N(WN) approx 1
and N(WC8-9)/N(WC4-7) approx 6 for the `quiescent' disk population. Including
recent results for the nucleus and accounting for incompleteness in our
spectroscopic sample, we suspect the total WR population of M83 may exceed 3000
stars.",2005-06-15T13:55:51Z
"The Proper Motion of the Magellanic Clouds: The UCAC2-Hipparcos
  Inconsistency","Using the USNO CCD Astrograph all-sky Catalog (UCAC2), we measure the mean
proper motion of the two Magellanic Clouds. Appropriately selected LMC
populations show a proper motion (<\mu RA>, <\mu DEC>) ~ (+0.84,+4.32) that is
significantly higher, in <\mu DEC>, than currently accepted Hipparcos-like
values, <\mu RA>, <\mu DEC> ~ (+1.94,-0.14). A higher <\mu RA> value is also
found for the SMC. Interestingly, the mean UCAC2 LMC proper motion agrees very
well with the only work in the literature (Anguita et al. 2000) pointing to an
unbound Magellanic Clouds-Milky Way interaction. Nonetheless, the implications
of the UCAC2 proper motion are hard to reconcile with our present day
understanding of the Clouds-Galaxy interaction unless one assumes a more
massive Milky Way. Consequently, although no sources of systematic error have
been identified, it is perhaps most likely that the UCAC2 catalog has an as yet
unidentified systematic error resulting in an inconsistency between UCAC2 and
Hipparcos based results for the Magellanic Clouds.",2005-04-18T20:03:17Z
Probing dark matter caustics with weak lensing,"Caustics are high-density structures that form frequently in collisionless
media. Under self-gravity, cold dark matter flows focus onto caustics which are
yet to be resolved in numerical simulations and or observed in the real world.
If detected, caustics would provide a strong evidence for dark matter and would
rule out alternative models such as those with modified dynamics. Here, we
demonstrate how they might be observed in the weak lensing data. We evaluate
the shear distortion and show that its radial profile is marked by a
characteristic sawtooth pattern due to the caustics in dark matter haloes that
form by selfsimilar accretion. We discuss the observational complications,
mainly due to the poor knowledge of the virial radii of the haloes and
demonstrate that a superposition of about 300 cluster-size haloes would give a
signal-to-noise ratio which is sufficiently large for the detection of caustics
with ground-based observations. This number is reduced to 100 for space-based
observations. These bounds can be easily achieved by the ongoing wide field
optical surveys such as CFHTLS and the future space-based projects SNAP and
DUNE which have to be accompanied by a X-ray follow-up of the selected clusters
for a precise determination of their virial radii.",2005-06-02T15:36:22Z
Monte Carlo radiative transfer in SPH density fields,"We combine a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code with an SPH code, so that --
assuming thermal equilibrium -- we can calculate dust-temperature fields,
spectral energy distributions, and isophotal maps, for the individual
time-frames generated by an SPH simulation. On large scales, the radiative
transfer cells (RT cells) are borrowed from the tree structure built by the SPH
code, and are chosen so that their size -- and hence the resolution of the
calculated temperature field -- is comparable with the resolution of the
density field. We refer collectively to these cubic RT cells as the 'global
grid'. The code is tested and found to treat externally illuminated dust
configurations very well. However, when there are embedded discrete sources,
i.e. stars, these produce very steep local temperature gradients which can only
be modelled properly if -- in the immediate vicinity of, and centred on, each
embedded star -- we supplement the global grid with a 'star grid' of closely
spaced concentric RT cells.",2005-05-13T15:23:53Z
Minimal tau approximation and simulations of the alpha effect,"The validity of a closure called the minimal tau approximation (MTA), is
tested in the context of dynamo theory, wherein triple correlations are assumed
to provide relaxation of the turbulent electromotive force. Under MTA, the
alpha effect in mean field dynamo theory becomes proportional to a relaxation
time scale multiplied by the difference between kinetic and current helicities.
It is shown that the value of the relaxation time is positive and, in units of
the turnover time at the forcing wavenumber, it is of the order of unity. It is
quenched by the magnetic field -- roughly independently of the magnetic
Reynolds number. However, this independence becomes uncertain at large magnetic
Reynolds number. Kinetic and current helicities are shown to be dominated by
large scale properties of the flow.",2005-04-10T01:38:44Z
Neural networks for gamma-hadron separation in MAGIC,"Neural networks have proved to be versatile and robust for particle
separation in many experiments related to particle astrophysics. We apply these
techniques to separate gamma rays from hadrons for the MAGIC Cerenkov
Telescope. Two types of neural network architectures have been used for the
classi cation task: one is the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) based on supervised
learning, and the other is the Self-Organising Tree Algorithm (SOTA), which is
based on unsupervised learning. We propose a new architecture by combining
these two neural networks types to yield better and faster classi cation
results for our classi cation problem.",2005-03-24T14:46:32Z
Kiso observations for 20 GRBs in HETE-2 era,"We have established a GRB follow-up observation system at Kiso observatory
(Japan) in 2001. Since the east Asian area had been blank for the GRB follow-up
observational network, this observational system is very important in studying
the temporal and spectral evolution of early afterglows. Using this system, we
have performed quick observations for optical afterglows from early phase based
on HETE-2 and INTEGRAL alerts. Thanks to the quick follow-up observation
system, we have been able to use the Kiso observatory in 20 events, and conduct
their follow-up observations in optical and near infrared wavelengths.",2005-06-10T12:47:08Z
"Millimeter Wave Observations of the Core-Jet and Molecular Gas in the FR
  I Radio Galaxy NGC 3801","We present BIMA 3 mm observations of the radio continuum source and the
molecular gas disk in the radio loud Fanaroff & Riley Type I (FR I)galaxy
NGC3801.We have detected a continuum source in the nucleus and determined that
it has a flat millimeter-wave spectrum, suggesting that the emission is
non-thermal and due to an AGN; the radio core is not evident in existing VLA
observations. We also map the extended 3 mm emission from the previously known
radio jets. In addition, we detect CO (1--0) emission associated with the dust
disk observed in previous HST images. A velocity gradient is observed,
indicating a two kpc radius rotating gas ring or disk oriented roughly
perpendicular to the radio jets. The inferred molecular gas mass of the disk is
$M(H_{2})=3\times10^{8}M_{\odot}$, about 1% of the dynamical mass. We also find
a $\sim 10^8$ M$_\odot$ molecular gas clump not associated with the gas disk.
There is evidence that this gas is associated with a merger and is infalling.
This suggests that FR I type activity is related to merger activity, as is
thought to be the case for FR II type radio galaxies. We also find indications
that one of the radio jets is entraining gas from the infalling molecular gas.",2005-05-13T15:07:56Z
"The search for optical emission on and before the GRB trigger with the
  WIDGET telescope","WIDGET is a robotic telescope for monitoring the HETE-2 field-of-view to

Akeno observing site where is about 200 km apart from Tokyo. Typical limiting
magnitude with S/N=3 at the site is V=10mag for 5 seconds exposure and V=11mag
for 30 seconds exposure. We had already six coincident observations with HETE-2
position alerts. It was, however, cloudy for all cases due to rainy season in
Japan. Expected number of coincident observations under clear sky is about 5
events per year. We will extend the system in early 2005 for Swift era to
monitor optical transients in wider field-of-view, multi-color or polarization
modes.",2005-06-10T12:38:05Z
"Modeling the 3--D Secular Planetary Three-Body Problem. Discussion on
  the outer ${\upsilon}$ Andromedae Planetary System","The three-dimensional secular behavior of a system composed of a central star
and two massive planets is modeled semi-analytically in the frame of the
general three-body problem. The main dynamical features of the system are
presented in geometrical pictures allowing us to investigate a large domain of
the phase space of this problem without time-expensive numerical integrations
of the equations of motion and without any restriction on the magnitude of the
planetary eccentricities, inclinations and mutual distance. Several regimes of
motion of the system are observed. With respect to the secular angle
$\Delta\varpi$, possible motions are circulations, oscillations (around 0 and
$180^\circ$), and high eccentricity/inclination librations in secular
resonances. With respect to the arguments of pericenter, $\omega_1$ and
$\omega_2$, possible motions are direct circulation and high-inclination
libration around $\pm 90^\circ$ in the Lidov-Kozai resonance. The regions of
transition between domains of different regimes of motion are characterized by
chaotic behavior.
  We apply the analysis to the case of the two outer planets of the $\upsilon$
Andromedae system, observed edge-on. The topology of the 3--D phase space of
this system is investigated in detail by means of surfaces of section, periodic
orbits and dynamical spectra, mapping techniques and numerical simulations. We
obtain the general structure of the phase space, and the boundaries of the
spatial secular stability. We find that this system is secularly stable in a
large domain of eccentricities and inclinations.",2005-05-09T14:02:00Z
Core Structure of Intracluster Gas: Isothermal Hydrostatic Equilibrium,"We investigate core structures of X-ray emitting intracluster gas based on
the so-called beta-model, which is an isothermal hydrostatic model often used
in observational studies. We reconsider the beta-model and find that the virial
temperature T_vir of a cluster may be represented better by beta T_X than T_X,
where beta is the parameter obtained from the X-ray surface brightness and T_X
is the emission-weighted mean temperature of the gas. We investigate 121
clusters observed by ROSAT and ASCA and find that the luminosity-temperature
relation L_X - beta T_X is less steep than L_X - T_X. We classify the clusters
into two core-size groups in order to investigate their properties in detail.
While in the larger core group the core radius is marginally proportional to
the virial radius, no significant relation is found for the smaller core group.
This may suggest that the smaller cores reflect the presence of cD galaxies,
effect of radiative cooling or asymmetry in the surface brightness. We examine
such possibilities, and find that the clusters of smaller cores have shorter
cooling time than the Hubble time, while no significant correlation is found
with cD or asymmetry. We carry out hydrodynamical calculations to simulate the
beta-model, intending to see the behavior of the isothermal gas under the
gravitational potential including the dark matter and galaxies with or without
a central cD galaxy. Calculations show r_c \propto r_vir and T_vir \simeq beta
T consistently with our consideration to the beta-model. Also is found from
calculations that the presence of a large cD galaxy may form a gas core \sim 40
kpc, which seems too small to account for the range of the core sizes, 40--80
kpc, of the smaller core group.",2005-04-05T09:00:00Z
"Stars beyond Galaxies: The Origin of Extended Luminous Halos around
  Galaxies","(Abridged) We use numerical simulations to investigate the origin and
structure of the luminous halos that surround isolated galaxies. These stellar
structures extend out to several hundred kpc away from a galaxy, and consist of
stars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion events that
characterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies. Such origin suggests that
outer luminous halos are ubiquitous and that they should appear as an excess of
light over extrapolations of the galaxy's inner profile beyond its traditional
luminous radius. The mass profile of the accreted stellar component is well
approximated by a model where the logarithmic slope steepens monotonically with
radius; from -3 at the luminous edge of the galaxy to -4 or steeper near the
virial radius of the system. Such spatial distribution is consistent with that
of Galactic and M31 globular clusters, suggesting that many of the globulars
were brought in by accretion events, in a manner akin to the classic
Searle-Zinn scenario. The outer stellar spheroid is supported by a velocity
dispersion tensor with a substantial and radially increasing radial anisotropy.
These properties distinguish the stellar halo from the dark matter component,
which is more isotropic in velocity space, as well as from some tracers of the
outer spheroid such as satellite galaxies. Most stars in the outer halo formed
in progenitors that have since merged with the central galaxy; very few stars
in the halo are contributed by satellites that survive as self-bound entities
at the present. These features are in reasonable agreement with recent
observations of the outer halo of the MW, of M31, and of other isolated
spirals, and suggest that all of these systems underwent an early period of
active merging, as envisioned in hierarchical models of galaxy formation.",2005-06-27T19:56:00Z

"Membership of the Orion Nebula Population from the Chandra Orion
  Ultradeep Project","The Chandra Orion Ultradeep project (COUP) observation described in a
companion paper by Getman et al. provides an exceptionally deep X-ray survey of
the Orion Nebula Cluster and associated embedded young stellar objects.
Membership of the region is important for studies of the stellar IMF, cluster
dynamics, and star formation. The COUP study detected 1616 X-ray sources. In
this study we confirm cloud membership for 1315 stars, identify 16 probable
foreground field stars having optical counterparts with discrepant proper
motions, and classify the remaining 285 X-ray sources, of which 51 are lightly
and 234 heavily obscured. The 51 lightly obscured sources without known
counterparts fall into three groups. (i) Sixteen are likely new members of the
Orion Nebula Cluster. (ii) Two with unusually soft and non-flaring X-ray
emission appear to be associated with nebular shocks, and may be new examples
of X-rays produced at the bow shocks of Herbig-Haro outflows. (iii) The
remaining thirty three are very weak uncertain sources, possibly spurious. Out
of 234 heavily absorbed sources without optical or near-infrared counterparts
75 COUP sources are likely new embedded cloud members (with membership for 42
confirmed by powerful X-ray flares), and the remaining 159 are likely
extragalactic AGN seen through the molecular cloud, as argued by a careful
simulation of the extragalactic background population. Finally, a few new
binary companions to Orion stars may have been found, but most cases of
proximate COUP sources can be attributed to chance superpositions in this
crowded field.",2005-04-17T23:54:17Z

Chandra's tryst with SN 1995N,"We present the spectroscopic and imaging analysis of a type IIn supernova SN
1995N observed with the Chandra X-ray observatory on 2004 March 27. We compare
the spectrum obtained from our Chandra observation with that of the previous
observation with ASCA in 1998. We find the presence of Neon lines in the
Chandra spectrum that were not reported in the ASCA observation. We see no
evidence of Iron in both epochs. The observed absorption column depth indicates
an extra component over and above the galactic absorption component and is
possibly due to a cool dense shell between the reverse-shock and the contact
discontinuity in the ejecta. The ASCA and the ROSAT observations suggested a
non-linear behavior of the X-ray light curve. However, with the higher spatial
resolution and sensitivity of Chandra, we separate out many nearby sources in
the supernova field-of-view that had additionally contributed to the supernova
flux due to the large Point Spread Function of the ASCA. Taking out the
contribution of those nearby sources, we find that the light curves are
consistent with a linear decline profile. We consider the light curve in the
high energy band separately. We discuss our results in the context of models of
nucleosynthesis and the interaction of the shock waves with the circumstellar
medium in core collapse supernovae.",2005-05-03T10:35:13Z
"The Dog on the Ship: The ""Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy"" as an Outlying Part
  of the Argo Star System","Overdensities in the distribution of low latitude, 2MASS giant stars are
revealed by systematically peeling away from sky maps the bulk of the giant
stars conforming to ``isotropic'' density laws generally accounting for known
Milky Way components. This procedure, combined with a higher resolution
treatment of the sky density of both giants and dust allows us to probe to
lower Galactic latitudes than previous 2MASS giant star studies. While the
results show the swath of excess giants previously associated with the
Monoceros ring system in the second and third Galactic quadrants at distances
of 6-20 kpc, we also find a several times larger overdensity of giants in the
same distance range concentrated in the direction of the ancient constellation
Argo. Isodensity contours of the large structure suggest that it is highly
elongated and inclined by about 3 deg to the disk, although details of the
structure -- including the actual location of highest density, overall extent,
true shape -- and its origin, remain unknown because only a fraction of it lies
outside highly dust-obscured, low latitude regions. Nevertheless, our results
suggest that the 2MASS M giant overdensity previously claimed to represent the
core of a dwarf galaxy in Canis Major (l ~ 240 deg) is an artifact of a dust
extinction window opening to the overall density rise to the more significant
Argo structure centered at larger longitude (l ~ 290 +- 10 deg, b ~ -4 +- 2
deg).",2005-04-05T18:33:58Z
"State transition and flaring activity of IGR J17464-3213/H1743-322 with
  SPI/INTEGRAL telescope","IGR J17464-3213, already known as the HEAO-1 transient source H1743-322, has
been detected during a state transition by the SPI/INTEGRAL telescope. We
describe the spectral evolution and flaring activity of IGR
J17464-3213/H1743-322 from 2003 March 21 to 2003 April 22. During the first
part, the source followed a continuous spectral softening, with the peak of the
spectral energy distribution shifting from 100 keV down to a few keV. However
the thermal disk and the hard X-ray components had a similar intensity,
indicating that the source was in an intermediate state throughout our
observations and evolving toward the soft state. In the second part of our
observations, the ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL light curve showed a strong flaring
activity. Two flare events lasting about 1 day each have been detected with SPI
and are probably due to instabilities in the accretion disk associated with the
state transition. During these flares, the low (1.5-12 keV) and high (20-200
keV) energy fluxes monitored with ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL, are correlated and
the spectral shape (above 20 keV) remains unchanged while the luminosity
increases by a factor greater than 2.",2005-05-19T15:05:38Z

A New Milky Way Dwarf Galaxy in Ursa Major,"In this Letter, we report the discovery of a new dwarf satellite to the Milky
Way, located at ($\alpha_{2000}, \delta_{2000}$) $=$ (158.72,51.92) in the
constellation of Ursa Major. This object was detected as an overdensity of red,
resolved stars in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. The color-magnitude diagram of
the Ursa Major dwarf looks remarkably similar to that of Sextans, the lowest
surface brightness Milky Way companion known, but with approximately an order
of magnitude fewer stars. Deeper follow-up imaging confirms this object has an
old and metal-poor stellar population and is $\sim$ 100 kpc away. We roughly
estimate M$_V =$ -6.75 and $r_{1/2} =$ 250 pc for this dwarf. Its luminosity is
several times fainter than the faintest known Milky Way dwarf. However, its
physical size is typical for dSphs. Even though its absolute magnitude and size
are presently quite uncertain, Ursa Major is likely the lowest luminosity and
lowest surface brightness galaxy yet known.",2005-03-25T15:41:12Z
"Spectroscopic study of blue compact galaxies V. oxygen abundance and the
  metallicity-luminosity relation","This is the fifth paper in a series studying the stellar components, star
formation histories, star formation rates and metallicities of a blue compact
galaxy (BCG) sample. Based on our high-quality ground-based spectroscopic
observations, we have determined the electron temperatures, electron densities,
nitrogen abundances and oxygen abundances for 72 star-forming BCGs in our
sample, using different oxygen abundance indicators. The oxygen abundance
covers the range 7.15 < 12 + log (O/H)< 9.0, and nitrogen is found to be mostly
a product of secondary nucleosynthesis for 12 + log (O/H)>8.2 and apparently a
product of primary nucleosynthesis for 12 + log (O/H)< 8.2. To assess the
possible systematic differences among different oxygen abundance indicators, we
have compared oxygen abundances of BCGs obtained with the Te method, R23
method, P method, N2 method and O3N2 method. The oxygen abundances derived from
the Te method are systematically lower by 0.1-0.25 dex than those derived from
the strong line empirical abundance indicators, consistent with previous
studies based on region samples. We confirm the existence of the
metallicity-luminosity relation in BCGs over a large range of abundances and
luminosities. Our sample of galaxies shows that the slope of the
metallicity-luminosity relation for the luminous galaxies (~-0.05) is slightly
shallower than that for the dwarf galaxies (~-0.17). An offset was found in the
metallicity-luminosity relation of the local galaxies and that of the
intermediate redshift galaxies. It shows that the metallicity-luminosity
relation for the emission line galaxies at high redshift is displaced to lower
abundances, higher luminosities, or both.",2005-07-13T01:51:43Z
A New Technique for Probing Convection in Pulsating White Dwarf Stars,"In this paper we demonstrate how pulsating white dwarfs can be used as an
astrophysical laboratory for empirically constraining convection in these
stars. We do this using a technique for fitting observed non-sinusoidal light
curves, which allows us to recover the thermal response timescale of the
convection zone (its ""depth"") as well as how this timescale changes as a
function of effective temperature. We also obtain constraints on mode
identifications for the pulsation modes, allowing us to use asteroseismology to
study the interior structure of these stars. Aspects of this approach may have
relevance for other classes of pulsators, including the Cepheids and RR Lyrae
stars.",2005-07-19T18:55:40Z
"Spectroscopic Study of SU UMa-type Dwarf Nova YZ Cnc during its 2002
  Superoutburst","We report time-resolved spectroscopic observations of the SU Ursae Majoris
dwarf nova, YZ Cnc, for 2 nights over 11 hrs during its 2002 January
superoutburst. The spectra only show absorption-line profiles in the first day.
But the lines display blue and red troughs, with ``W'' profiles in the second
day. The radial velocity curve of the absorption troughs and emission peaks of
H$\beta$ has an amplitude of $49\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$ and a phase offset of
$-0.07\pm0.04$, which are very similar to those measured in quiescence;
however, the $\gamma$ velocity deviates strongly from the systemic velocity
measured in quiescence, showing variation of the order of $\pm$60 km s$^{-1}$.
And large shifts of $\sim$70 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$0.09, for the
orbital-averaged velocity and phase respectively, are also found in our
observations. All these phenomena can be well explained with a precession of an
eccentric disk and we conclude that these phenomena are the characteristic
products of an eccentric accretion disk.",2005-07-11T09:11:59Z
Evolving turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters,"We discuss, using simple analytical models and MHD simulations, the origin
and parameters of turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Three
physically distinct regimes can be identified in the evolution of cluster
turbulence and magnetic fields. Firstly, the fluctuation dynamo will produce
microgauss-strong, random magnetic fields during cluster formation and major
mergers. Turbulent velocity of about 300 km/s can be maintained at scales
100-200 kpc. The magnetic field is intermittent, has a smaller scale of 20-30
kpc and average strength of 2 microgauss. Secondly, when major mergers end,
turbulent speed and magnetic field undergo a power-law decay, decreasing in
strength but increasing in scale by a factor of about two. Thirdly,
smaller-mass subclusters and cluster galaxies produce turbulent wakes, with
turbulent speeds and magnetic field strengths similar to those quoted above.
The velocity scales are about 200 kpc and 10 kpc respectively, and the magnetic
field scale is about 6 times smaller. Although these wakes may fill only a
small fraction of the cluster volume, their area covering factor can be close
to unity. So one can potentially reconcile observations that indicate the
coexistence of turbulence with ordered filamentary gas structures, as in the
Perseus cluster. Random Faraday rotation measure is estimated to be typically
100-200 rad/m^2, in agreement with observations. We predict detectable
synchrotron polarization from cluster radio halos at wavelengths 3-6 cm, if
observed at sufficiently high resolution (abridged).",2005-05-07T18:07:23Z
"Discovery of the Binary Pulsar PSR B1259-63 in Very-High-Energy Gamma
  Rays around Periastron with H.E.S.S","We report the discovery of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission of the
binary system PSR B1259-63/SS 2883 of a radio pulsar orbiting a massive,
luminous Be star in a highly eccentric orbit. The observations around the 2004
periastron passage of the pulsar were performed with the four 13 m Cherenkov
telescopes of the H.E.S.S. experiment, recently installed in Namibia and in
full operation since December 2003. Between February and June 2004, a gamma-ray
signal from the binary system was detected with a total significance above 13
sigma. The flux was found to vary significantly on timescales of days which
makes PSR B1259-63 the first variable galactic source of VHE gamma-rays
observed so far. Strong emission signals were observed in pre- and
post-periastron phases with a flux minimum around periastron, followed by a
gradual flux decrease in the months after. The measured time-averaged energy
spectrum above a mean threshold energy of 380 GeV can be fitted by a simple
power law F_0(E/1 TeV)^-Gamma with a photon index Gamma =
2.7+-0.2_stat+-0.2_sys and flux normalisation F_0 = (1.3+-0.1_stat+-0.3_sys)
10^-12 TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1. This detection of VHE gamma-rays provides unambiguous
evidence for particle acceleration to multi-TeV energies in the binary system.
In combination with coeval observations of the X-ray synchrotron emission by
the RXTE and INTEGRAL instruments, and assuming the VHE gamma-ray emission to
be produced by the inverse Compton mechanism, the magnetic field strength can
be directly estimated to be of the order of 1 G.",2005-06-13T19:04:00Z
The basic parameters of gamma-ray-loud blazars,"We determined the basic parameters, such as the central black hole mass
($M$), the boosting factor (or Doppler factor) ($\delta$), the propagation
angle ($\Phi$) and the distance along the axis to the site of $\gamma$-ray
production ($d$) for 23 $\gamma$-ray-loud blazars using their available
variability timescales. In this method, the absorption effect depends on the
$\gamma$-ray energy, emission size and property of the accretion disk. Using
the intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity as a fraction $\lambda$ of the Eddington
luminosity, $L^{in}_{\gamma}=\lambda L_{Ledd.}$ and the optical depth equal to
unity, we can determine the upper limit of the central black hole masses. We
found that the black hole masses range between $10^{7}M_{\odot}$ and
$10^{9}M_{\odot}$ when $\lambda$ = 0.1 and 1.0 are adopted. Since this method
is based on gamma-ray emissions and the short time-scale of the sources, it can
also be used for central black hole mass determination of high redshift
gamma-ray sources. In the case of the upper limit of black hole mass there is
no clear difference between BLs and FSRQs, which suggests that the central
black hole masses do not play an important role in the evolutionary sequence of
blazars.",2005-03-31T14:16:40Z
"Spectral Evolution of a Luminous Compact X-Ray Source in NGC 253 with
  Chandra and XMM-Newton","Spectral studies of a luminous X-ray source, NGC 253 X21, are presented based
on archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data. The Chandra observation on 1999
December 16 detected the source at a bolometric luminosity of 0.3 x 10^39 erg/s
(assuming isotropic emission), while an XMM-Newton observation on 2000 June 3
revealed a short-term source variation in the range of (0.6--1.3) x 10^39
erg/s. All spectra from these observations were successfully modeled by
emission from an optically thick accretion disk. The average inner disk radius
was kept constant at 63 x (cos 60/cos i)^(1/2) km, where i is the disk
inclination, and did not vary significantly, while the disk inner temperature
changed in the range of 0.9--1.4 keV. Assuming that this object is an accreting
Schwarzschild black hole, and that the disk inner radius coincides with its
last stable orbit, the mass of the black hole is estimated to be ~ 7 M_sun. The
disk luminosity corresponds to (30--120) x (cos 60/cos i) % of the Eddington
limit of this black hole. Therefore, this luminous X-ray source, NGC 253 X21,
is understood consistently to be an accreting stellar mass black hole in the
standard disk state.",2005-06-27T08:11:27Z
Inflation: A graceful entrance from Loop Quantum Cosmology,"The evolution of a scalar field is explored taking into account the presence
of a background fluid in a positively curved Universe in the framework of loop
quantum cosmology. Though the mechanism that provides the initial conditions
for inflation extensively studied in the literature, is still available in this
setup, it demands that the initial kinetic energy of the field be comparable to
the energy density of the background fluid if the field is initially situated
at the minimum of the potential. It is found, however, that for potentials with
a minimum such as the chaotic inflation model, there is an additional mechanism
that can provide the correct initial conditions for successful inflation even
if initially the kinetic energy of the field is subdominant by many orders of
magnitude. In this latter mechanism the field switches direction when the
Universe is still in the expanding phase. The kinetic energy gained while the
field rolls down the potential is subsequently enhanced when the universe
enters the collapsing phase pushing the field one step up the potential. This
behavior is repeated on every cycle of contraction and expansion of the
Universe until the field becomes dominant and inflation follows.",2005-07-28T23:07:41Z
"The Build-up of the Colour-Magnitude Relation as a Function of
  Environment","We discuss the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution based on deep
panoramic imaging of two distant clusters taken with Suprime-Cam as part of the
PISCES project. By combining with the SDSS data as a local counterpart for
comparison, we construct a large sample of galaxies that spans wide ranges in
environment, time, and stellar mass (or luminosity). We find that colours of
galaxies, especially those of faint galaxies ($M_V>M_V^*+1$), change from blue
to red at a break density as we go to denser regions. Based on local and global
densities of galaxies, we classify three environments: field, groups, and
clusters. We show that the cluster colour-magnitude relation is already built
at $z=0.83$. In contrast to this, the bright-end of the field colour-magnitude
relation has been vigorously built all the way down to the present-day and the
build-up at the faint-end has not started yet. A possible interpretation of
these results is that galaxies evolve in the 'down-sizing' fashion. That is,
massive galaxies complete their star formation first and the truncation of star
formation is propagated to smaller objects as time progresses. This trend is
likely to depend on environment since the build-up of the colour-magnitude
relation is delayed in lower-density environments. Therefore, we may suggest
that the evolution of galaxies took place earliest in massive galaxies and in
high density regions, and it is delayed in less massive galaxies and in lower
density regions.",2005-06-29T03:58:45Z
"Near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy of violent starburst
  environments","Near-infrared (NIR) integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) of violent starburst
environments at high spatial (and spectral) resolution has the potential to
revolutionise our ideas regarding the local interactions between the
newly-formed massive stars and the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host
galaxies. To illustrate this point, I present NIR IFS analysis of the central
starburst region of NGC 1140, obtained with CIRPASS on Gemini-South. While
strong [FeII] emission is found throughout the galaxy, higher-order Brackett
emission is predominantly associated with the northern starburst region. Based
on the spatial distributions of the [FeII] versus Brackett line emission, I
conclude that a galaxy-wide starburst was induced several x 10^7 yr ago, with
more recent starburst activity concentrated around the northern starburst
region. I look forward and discuss the exciting prospects that IFS at higher
spatial (and spectral) resolution will allow us trace (i) the massive outflows
(""superwinds"") expected to originate in the dense, young massive star clusters
commonly found in intense starburst environments, and (ii) their impact on the
galaxy's ISM.",2005-05-20T11:23:16Z
The Island state of the Atoll Source 4U 1820--30,"We study the rapid X-ray time variability in all public data available from
the \textit{Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer's} Proportional Counter Array on the
atoll source 4U 1820--30 in the low-luminosity island state. A total of
$\sim46$ ks of data were used. We compare the frequencies of the variability
components of 4U 1820--30 with those in other atolls sources. These frequencies
were previously found to follow a universal scheme of correlations. We find
that 4U 1820--30 shows correlations that are shifted by factors of
$1.13\pm0.01$ and $1.21\pm0.02$ with respect to those in other atoll sources.
These shifts are similar to, but smaller than the shift factor $\sim1.45$
previously reported for some accreting millisecond pulsars. Therefore, 4U
1820--30 is the first atoll source which shows no significant pulsations but
has a significant shift in the frequency correlations compared with other 3
non-pulsating atoll sources.",2005-07-05T14:12:11Z
Structure in the motions of the fastest halo stars,"We have analyzed the catalog of 2106 non-kinematically selected metal poor
stars in the solar neighborhood published by Beers et al. (2000), with the goal
of quantifying the amount of substructure in the motions of the fastest halo
stars. We have computed the two-point velocity correlation function for a
subsample of halo stars within 1-2 kpc of the Sun, and found statistical
evidence of substructure, with a similar amplitude to that predicted by high
resolution CDM simulations. The signal is due to a small kinematic group whose
dynamical properties are compared to the stellar ""stream"", previously
discovered by Helmi et al. (1999). If real, this high velocity moving group
would provide further support to the idea that substructures remain as fossils
from the formation of the Galaxy as expected in the CDM scenario.",2005-04-05T15:28:44Z

"Dark galaxies or tidal debris? Kinematical clues to the origin of
  massive isolated HI clouds","An extended HI cloud (VIRGOHI 21) with an HI mass of $\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$
and no apparent optical counterpart was recently discovered in the Virgo
cluster. In order to understand the origin of physical properties of apparently
isolated HI clouds like the VIRGOHI21, we numerically investigate physical
properties of tidal HI debris that were formed by galaxy-galaxy interaction in
clusters of galaxies. Our hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that tidal
debris with total HI masses of $10^8-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ can have (1) wide HI
velocity widths ($>200$ km s$^{-1}$), (2) a small mass fraction of stars
($\sim$10%), and (3) a mean $B$-band surface brightness of the stellar
components fainter than 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. These results suggest that the
VIRGOHI21, which lies at a projected distance of $\sim$ 150 kpc from the
one-armed, HI-rich spiral galaxy M99 (NGC 4254), is tidal debris. We propose
that the comparison between the simulated and the observed velocity fields of
HI clouds allows us to better understand their nature and origin (e.g., whether
they are just tidal debris or ``dark galaxies'' that have HI gas only and are
embedded by dark matter halos). We also discuss the timescales for isolated HI
gas to be evaporated by thermal conduction of the hot intracluster gas.",2005-05-29T09:56:21Z
"The Birthplace of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Field Versus Globular Cluster
  Populations","Recent Chandra studies of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) within early-type
galaxies have found that LMXBs are commonly located within globular clusters of
the galaxies. However, whether all LMXBs are formed within globular clusters
has remained an open question. If all LMXBs formed within globular clusters,
the summed X-ray luminosity of the LMXBs in a galaxy should be directly
proportional to the number of globular clusters in the galaxy regardless of
where the LMXBs currently reside. We have compared these two quantities over
the same angular area for a sample of 12 elliptical and S0 galaxies observed
with Chandra and found that the correlation between the two quantities is
weaker than expected if all LMXBs formed within globular clusters. This
indicates that a significant number of the LMXBs were formed in the field, and
naturally accounts for the spread in field-to-cluster fractions of LMXBs from
galaxy to galaxy. We also find that the ""pollution"" of globular cluster LMXBs
into the field has been minimal within elliptical galaxies, but there is
evidence that roughly half of the LMXBs originally in the globular clusters of
S0 galaxies in our sample have escaped into the field. This is due to higher
globular cluster disruption rates in S0s resulting from stronger gravitational
shocks caused by the passage of globular clusters through the disks of S0
galaxies that are absent in elliptical galaxies.",2005-06-09T20:00:04Z
Evolving Dark Energy with w Deviating from -1,"Theories of evolving quintessence are constructed that generically lead to
deviations from the w = -1 prediction of non-evolving dark energy. The small
mass scale that governs evolution, m_\phi \approx 10^{-33} eV, is radiatively
stable, and the ``Why Now?'' problem is solved. These results rest crucially on
seesaw cosmology: in broad outline, fundamental physics and cosmology can be
understood from only two mass scales, the weak scale, v, and the Planck scale,
M. Requiring a scale of dark energy \rho_{DE}^{1/4} governed by v^2/M, and a
radiatively stable evolution rate m_\phi given by v^4/M^3, leads to a
distinctive form for the equation of state w(z) that follows from a cosine
quintessence potential. An explicit hidden axion model is constructed. Dark
energy resides in the potential of the axion field which is generated by a new
QCD-like force that gets strong at the scale \Lambda \approx v^2/M \approx
\rho_{DE}^{1/4}. The evolution rate is given by a second seesaw that leads to
the axion mass, m_\phi \approx \Lambda^2/f, with f \approx M.",2005-03-31T16:41:41Z

Charge Exchange Spectra of Hydrogenic and He-like Iron,"We present H-like Fe XXVI and He-like Fe XXV charge-exchange spectra
resulting from collisions of highly charged iron with N2 gas at an energy of 10
eV/amu in an electron beam ion trap. Although individual high-n emission lines
are not resolved in our measurements, we observe that the most likely level for
Fe25+ --> Fe24+ electron capture is n~9, in line with expectations, while the
most likely value for Fe26+ --> Fe25+ charge exchange is significantly higher.
In the Fe XXV spectrum, the K-alpha emission feature dominates, whether
produced via charge exchange or collisional excitation. The K-alpha centroid is
lower in energy for the former case than the latter (6666 versus 6685 eV,
respectively), as expected because of the strong enhancement of emission from
the forbidden and intercombination lines, relative to the resonance line, in
charge-exchange spectra. In contrast, the Fe XXVI high-n Lyman lines have a
summed intensity greater than that of Ly-alpha, and are substantially stronger
than predicted from theoretical calculations of charge exchange with atomic H.
We conclude that the angular momentum distribution resulting from electron
capture using a multi-electron target gas is significantly different from that
obtained with H, resulting in the observed high-n enhancement. A discussion is
presented of the relevance of our results to studies of diffuse Fe emission in
the Galactic Center and Galactic Ridge, particularly with ASTRO-E2/Suzaku.",2005-08-02T15:40:55Z
Microlensing in the double quasar SBS1520+530,"We present the results of a monitoring campaign of the double quasar
SBS1520+530 at Maidanak observatory from April 2003 to August 2004. We obtained
light curves in V and R filters that show small-amplitude \Delta m~0.1 mag
intrinsic variations of the quasar on time scales of about 100 days. The data
set is consistent with the previously determined time delay of \Delta
t=(130+-3) days by Burud et al. (2002). We find that the time delay corrected
magnitude difference between the quasar images is now larger by (0.14+-0.03)
mag than during the observations by Burud et al. (2002). This confirms the
presence of gravitational microlensing variations in this system.",2005-05-24T13:25:26Z
Extensive air showers without muon component,"Extensive air showers of cosmic rays with energies above 5.10**18 eV
registered by the Yakutsk array have been analyzed. The existence of showers
without muon component is found. Among them we found 5 clusters and these
clusters correlate with nearest pulsars. It is found that there exist 4 classes
of showers. Showers with high content of muons are mainly observed at E>
4.10**19 eV and they are formed most likely by heavy nuclei.",2005-07-28T21:56:56Z
"Can Fluffy Dust Alleviate the ""Subsolar"" Interstellar Abundance Problem?","What might be the most appropriate set of interstellar reference abundances
of chemical elements (both in gas and in dust) relative to hydrogen has been a
subject of much discussion in the past decade. While historically the Sun has
been taken as the reference standard, it has recently been suggested that the
interstellar abundances might be better represented by those of B stars
(because of their young ages) which are just ~60--70% of the widely adopted
solar values (``subsolar''). On the other hand, the most recent estimates of
the solar carbon and oxygen abundances are also close to those of B stars. If
the interstellar abundances are indeed ``subsolar'' like B stars or the
newly-determined solar C,O values, there might be a lack of raw material to
form the dust to account for the interstellar extinction. In literature it has
been argued that this problem could be solved if interstellar grains have a
fluffy, porous structure since fluffy grains are more effective in absorbing
and scattering optical and ultraviolet starlight than compact grains (on a per
unit mass basis). However, we show in this work that, using the Kramers-Kronig
relation, fluffy dust is not able to overcome the abundance shortage problem. A
likely solution is that the abundances of refractory elements in stellar
photospheres may under-represent the composition of the interstellar material
from which stars are formed, resulting either from the possible underestimation
of the degree of heavy-element settling in stellar atmospheres, or from the
incomplete incorporation of heavy elements in stars during the star formation
process.",2005-03-25T20:31:43Z
TeV Gamma-Ray Observations of the Perseus Galaxy Cluster,"We report on observations of the Perseus cluster of galaxies using the 10 m
Whipple $\gamma$-ray telescope during the 2004-2005 observing season. We apply
a two dimensional analysis technique to allow us to scrutinize the cluster for
TeV emission. In this contribution we will first calculate flux upper limits on
TeV gamma-ray sources within the cluster. Second, we derive an upper limit on
the extended cluster emission. We then compare the flux upper limits with the
EGRET upper limit at 100 MeV and theoretical models.",2005-07-19T18:56:10Z
Radio Detection of Cosmic Ray Air Showers with Codalema,"Studies of the radio detection of Extensive Air Showers is the goal of the
demonstrative experiment CODALEMA. Previous analysis have demonstrated that
detection around $5.10^{16}$ eV was achieved with this set-up. New results
allow for the first time to study the topology of the electric field associated
to EAS events on a event by event basis.",2005-05-20T14:50:53Z
Constraints on hot metals in the Vicinity of the Galaxy,"We have searched for evidence of soft X-ray absorption by hot metals in the
vicinity of the Galaxy in the spectra of a small sample of fifteen Type I AGN
observed with the high resolution X-ray gratings on board Chandra. This is an
extension of our previous survey of hot OVII and OVIII absorbing gas in the
vicinity of the Galaxy. The strongest absorption signatures within a few
hundred km/s of their rest-frame energies are most likely due to warm absorbing
outflows from the nearest AGN, which are back-lighting the local hot gas. We
emphasize that absorption signatures in the spectra of some distant AGN that
are kinematically consistent with the recessional velocity of the AGN are most
likely to be due to hot local gas. Along the sightline towards PG 1211+143, PDS
456 and MCG-6-30-15 there is a very large absorbing Fe column density which is
kinematically consistent with absorption by hot, local Fe. The sightlines to
these three AGN pass through the limb of the Northern Polar Spur (NPS), a local
bubble formed from several supernovae which, if rich in Fe, may account for a
large local Fe column.
  We obtain limits on the column density of local, highly ionized N, Ne, Mg, Si
along all of the sightlines in our sample. We correlate the column density
limits with those of highly ionized O along the same sightlines. Assuming the
hot local gas is in collisionally ionized equilibrium, we obtain limits on the
temperature and relative abundances of the metals in the hot local gas. Our
limits on the ionic column densities in the local hot gas seem to be consistent
with those observed in the hot halo gas of edge-on normal spiral galaxies.",2005-06-15T15:41:19Z
"The Temperature Distribution of Dense Molecular Gas in the Center of NGC
  253","[abridged] We present interferometric maps of ammonia (NH3) of the nearby
starburst galaxy NGC 253 [star formation rate: ~2.8 Mo yr^(-1)]. The
observations have been taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and
include the para-NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and the ortho-NH3 (3,3) and (6,6) inversion
lines. Six major complexes of dense ammonia are identified, three of them on
either side of the starburst center, out to projected galactocentric radii of
\~250 pc. [...] The application of radiative transfer large velocity gradient
models reveals that the bulk of the ammonia molecules is embedded in a
one-temperature gas phase. Kinetic temperatures of this gas are ~200 and 140 K
toward the south-west and north-east [of the nucleus of NGC 253], respectively.
The temperatures under which ammonia was formed in the past are with >~30 K
also warmer toward the south-west than toward the north-east (~15-20 K). This
is indicated by the ortho-to-para ammonia ratio which is ~1 and 1.5-2.5 toward
the south-west and north-east, respectively. Ammonia column densities in the
brightest complexes are in the range of 6-11x10^(14) cm^(-2), which adds up to
a total ammonia mass of ~20 Mo, about evenly distributed toward both sides of
the nucleus. [...] Toward the center of NGC 253, NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and (6,6) is
detected in absorption against an unresolved continuum source. At the same
location, however, ammonia (3,3) is found in emission which indicates maser
activity. This would be the first detected extragalactic NH3 maser. Evidence
for an expanding shell in the south-western complex is provided. [...] The
shell and X-ray properties can be reproduced by the energy input of a highly
obscured young stellar cluster with a mass of ~10^5 Mo which also heats the
dense gas.",2005-05-07T14:08:06Z
"The ""missing"" YSOs in the central parsec of the Galaxy: evidence for
  star formation in a massive accretion disk and a top-heavy IMF","Few dozens of young high mass stars orbit Sgr A* at distances as short as 0.1
parsec, where star formation should be quenched by the strong tidal shear from
Sgr A*. The puzzling young stellar population is believed to come into
existence in one of the two ways:
  (i) ""normal"" star formation at several tens of parsec in a very massive star
cluster that then spiraled in, or (ii) star formation in situ in a massive
self-gravitating disk. We propose to constrain these two scenarios via the
expected X-ray emission from young low mass stars that should have formed
alongside the massive stars. To this end we compare the recent Chandra
observations of X-ray emission from young stars in the Orion Nebula, and the
Chandra observations of Sgr A* field. We show that the cluster inspiral model
is ruled out irrespectively of the initial mass function (IMF) of the young
stars. In addition, for the in situ model, we find that no more than few
thousand low-mass stars could have formed alongside the massive stars. This is
more than a factor of ten fewer than expected if these stars were formed with
the standard IMF as elsewhere in the Galaxy. The young stars in the GC are thus
the first solid observational evidence for star formation in AGN disks and also
require the IMF of these stars to be top-heavy. We briefly consider implication
of these results for AGN in general.",2005-07-29T03:03:09Z
Light-cone Simulations: Evolution of dark matter haloes,"We present a new fast method for simulating pencil-beam type light-cones,
using the MLAPM-code (Multi Level Adaptive Particle Mesh) with light-cone
additions. We show that by a careful choice of the light-cone orientation, it
is possible to avoid extra periodicities in the light-cone. As an example, we
apply the method to simulate a 6 Gpc deep light-cone, create the dark matter
halo catalogue for the light-cone and study the evolution of haloes from $z=6$
up to the present time. We determine the spatial density of the haloes, their
large-scale correlation function, and study the evolution of the mass function.
We find a surprisingly simple relation for the dependence of halo maximum mass
on redshift, and apply it to derive redshift limits for bright quasars.",2005-07-08T08:23:29Z
"Spectroscopic study of the long-period dust-producing WC7pd+O9 binary
  HD192641","We present the results of an optical spectroscopic study of the massive
Wolf-Rayet binary WR137. These data cover the dust-formation maximum in 1997.
Combining all available measurements of radial velocities, we derive, for the
first time, a spectroscopic orbit with period 13.05 +/- 0.18 years. The
resulting masses, adopting i=67degrees, are M(O)= 20 +/- 2 Mo and M(WR)= 4.4+/-
1.5 Mo. These appear, respectively, around normal and on the low side for the
given spectral types. Analysis of the intense multi-site spectroscopic
monitoring in 1999 shows that the CIII5696 and CIV5802/12 lines have the
highest intrinsic variability levels. The periodogram analysis yields a
small-amplitude modulation in the absorption troughs of the CIV5802/12 and
HeI5876 lines with a period of 0.83 days, which could be related either to
pulsations or large-scale rotating structures as seen in the WN4 star EZ Canis
Majoris (WR6).Wavelet analysis of the strong emission lines of CIII5696 and
CIV5802/12 enabled us to isolate and follow for several hours small structures
associated with density enhancements within the wind of the Wolf-Rayet star.
Cross-correlating the variability patterns seen in different lines, we find a
weak but significant correlation between the varability in emission lines with
different ionization potential, i.e. in lines formed at different distances
from the WR stellar core. Adopting a beta wind-velocity law, from the motion of
individual subpeaks we find beta around 5, which is significantly larger than
the canonical value of 1 usually found in O-star winds.",2005-04-21T16:33:23Z
"Using transport coefficients of cosmic rays in turbulent magnetic fields
  to determine hybrid viscosity in hot accretion disks around AGN","The nature of the viscosity operative in hot, two-temperature accretion disks
around AGN has been a long-standing, unsolved problem. It has been previously
suggested that protons, in conjunction with the turbulent magnetic field that
is likely to exist in the accretion disk, might be crucial in providing this
viscosity. Several authors have recently determined diffusion coefficients for
charged particles (cosmic rays) propagating in turbulent magnetic fields by
means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We use the diffusion coefficients
for protons determined by these simulations to find the effective mean free
path for protons in hot accretion disks. This in turn yields good estimates of
the viscosity due to energetic protons embedded in the turbulent magnetic field
of a hot, two-temperature accretion disk. We combine this with a simple
two-temperature accretion disk model to determine the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$
viscosity parameter arising out of this mechanism. We find that protons
diffusing in the turbulent magentic field embedded in a hot accretion d isk
provide a physically reasonable source of viscosity in hot accretion disks
around AGN.",2005-07-10T06:57:30Z
"A Highly Collimated, Young and Fast CO(2-1) Outflow in OMC1 South","We present high angular resolution (~ 1''), sensitive CO(2-1) line
observations of the region OMC1 South in the Orion Nebula made using the
Submillimeter Array (SMA). We detect the CO(2-1) high velocity outflow that was
first found by Rodriguez-Franco et al. (1999a) with the IRAM 30 m. Our
observations resolve the outflow, whose velocity-integrated emission has a
deconvolved width of 0.89'' \pm 0.06'' (490 AU) and a projected length of ~
48'' (21,000 AU) with very high redshifted and blueshifted gas with velocities
of about \pm 80 km/s. This outflow is among the most collimated (~ 3 degrees)
and youngest outflows (600 yr) that have been reported. The data show that this
collimated outflow has been blowing in the same direction during the last 600
yr. At high velocities, the CO(2-1) outflow traces an extremely collimated jet,
while at lower velocities the CO emission traces an envelope possibly produced
by entrainment of ambient gas. Furthermore, we also detect for the first time a
millimeter wavelength continuum source possibly associated with a class I
protostar that we suggest could be the possible exciting source for this
collimated outflow. However, the bolometric luminosity of this source appears
to be far too low to account for the powerful molecular outflow.",2005-05-02T23:46:32Z
"Statistics of phase correlations as a test for non-Gaussianity of the
  CMB maps","Gaussianity is the very base for derivation of the cosmological parameters
from the CMB angular power spectrum. Non-Gaussian signal, whether originated
from experimental error or primordial source, could mimic extra power in the
power spectrum, thereby leading to a wrong set of parameters. In this paper we
present a new Gaussianity analysis of the derived CMB singals. It is based on
the trigonometric moments of phases, which can be concluded with a ``mean
angle'', allowing us to see the global trend of non-Gaussianity of the signals.
These moments are also closely related to the Pearson's random walks. We apply
these analyses on the derived CMB maps and their different morphologies
manifest themselves through these functions. We also comment on rotational
invariance of the trigonometric moments of phases as a non-Gaussianity test.",2005-05-01T17:56:09Z
"Influence of local treatments of convection upon solar p mode excitation
  rates","We compute the rates P at which acoustic energy is injected into the solar
radial p modes for several solar models. The solar models are computed with two
different local treatments of convection: the classical mixing-length theory
(MLT hereafter) and Canuto et al (1996)'s formulation (CGM hereafter). Among
the models investigated here, our best models reproduce both the solar radius
and the solar luminosity at solar age and the observed Balmer line profiles.
For the MLT treatment, the rates P do depend significantly on the properties of
the atmosphere whereas for the CGM's treatment the dependence of P on the
properties of the atmosphere is found smaller than the error bars attached to
the seismic measurements. The excitation rates P for modes associated with the
MLT models are significantly underestimated compared with the solar seismic
constraints. The CGM models yield values for P closer to the seismic data than
the MLT models. We conclude that the solar p-mode excitation rates provide
valuable constraints and according to the present investigation clearly favor
the CGM treatment with respect to the MLT, although neither of them yields
values of P as close to the observations as recently found for 3D numerical
simulations.",2005-07-11T09:51:30Z
"A Hubble Space Telescope Snapshot Survey of Dynamically Close Galaxy
  Pairs in the CNOC2 Redshift Survey","We compare the structural properties of two classes of galaxies at
intermediate redshift: those in dynamically close galaxy pairs, and those which
are isolated. Both samples are selected from the CNOC2 Redshift Survey, and
have redshifts in the range 0.1 < z <0.6. Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 images
were acquired as part of a snapshot survey, and were used to measure bulge
fraction and asymmetry for these galaxies. We find that paired and isolated
galaxies have identical distributions of bulge fractions. Conversely, we find
that paired galaxies are much more likely to be asymmetric (R_T+R_A >= 0.13)
than isolated galaxies. Assuming that half of these pairs are unlikely to be
close enough to merge, we estimate that 40% +/- 11% of merging galaxies are
asymmetric, compared with 9% +/- 3% of isolated galaxies. The difference is
even more striking for strongly asymmetric (R_T+R_A >= 0.16) galaxies: 25% +/-
8% for merging galaxies versus 1% +/- 1% for isolated galaxies. We find that
strongly asymmetric paired galaxies are very blue, with rest-frame B-R colors
close to 0.80, compared with a mean (B-R)_0 of 1.24 for all paired galaxies. In
addition, asymmetric galaxies in pairs have strong [OII]3727 emission lines. We
conclude that close to half of the galaxy pairs in our sample are in the
process of merging, and that most of these mergers are accompanied by triggered
star formation.",2005-07-18T21:27:22Z
The properties of Galactic globular cluster sub-systems,"In this paper we compare the properties of three sub-systems of Galactic
globular clusters, which are defined according to metallicity and HB
morphology. We focus on cluster luminosities, structures, surface brightnesses
(SB) and ellipticities. It is shown that the so-called ""young"" halo (YH)
clusters, which may have been formed in external satellite galaxies, exhibit
characteristics clearly distinct from those of the ""old"" halo (OH) and
bulge/disk (BD) clusters, the majority of which are believed to be Galactic
natives. The YH clusters have properties most similar to those of clusters
belonging to several present day satellite dwarf galaxies. The OH and BD
populations have apparently been modified by destructive tidal forces in the
inner Galaxy. We estimate that the present population of Galactic natives may
only represent some two-thirds of the original population. Several low SB
clusters are highly flattened. We briefly speculate that this ellipticity may
represent the intrinsic flattening of dark matter mini-halos in which such
optically dim clusters might be embedded. Finally, we examine the distribution
of clusters on the size vs.luminosity plane. Three objects fall above the sharp
upper envelope of the main distribution on this plane: Omega Cen, M54, and NGC
2419. All three have previously, and independently, been suggested to be the
stripped cores of former dwarf galaxies. This suspicion is strengthened by the
observation that the massive cluster G1 in M31, plus a number of the most
luminous clusters in NGC 5128 also fall in the same region of the plane. All of
these objects have also previously been suggested to be the stripped cores of
now-defunct dwarf galaxies.",2005-04-06T11:02:00Z
Neutrino Processes in Strong Magnetic Fields,"The processes of electron neutrino capture on neutron and electron
anti-neutrino capture on proton, and their reverse processes provide the
dominant mechanisms for heating and cooling the material below the stalled
shock in a core-collapse supernova. We summarize the major effects of strong
magnetic fields on the rates of the above reactions and illustrate these
effects with a simple supernova model. Due to parity violation of weak
interaction the heating rates are asymmetric even for a uniform magnetic field.
The cooling rates are also asymmetric for nonuniform fields. The most dramatic
effect of strong magnetic fields of 10^16 G is suppression of the cooling rates
by changing the equations of state through the phase space of electrons and
positrons.",2005-06-07T00:31:58Z
A near-IR spectrum of the DO white dwarf RE J0503-285,"We present a near-IR spectroscopic analysis of the intriguing DO white dwarf
RE J0503-285. The IR spectrum fails to reveal evidence of the presence of a
spatially unresolved, cool, late-type companion. Hence we have placed an
approximate limit on the spectral-type and mass of a putative companion (later
than M8, M<0.085Msun). This result rules out ongoing interaction between the
white dwarf and a close companion with M>0.085Msun as responsible for the
discrepancies between the observed photospheric abundances and model
predictions. As the possibility remains that there is a cooler companion lying
beyond the detection threshold of this study we use our modelling to estimate
the improvement in sensitivity offered by a Spitzer observation.",2005-06-16T14:45:51Z
"The oscillation effects on thermalization of the neutrinos in the
  universe with low reheating temperature","We study how the oscillations of the neutrinos affect their thermalization
process during the reheating period with temperature O(1) MeV in the early
universe. We follow the evolution of the neutrino density matrices and
investigate how the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis vary with the
reheating temperature. For the reheating temperature of several MeV, we find
that including the oscillations makes different predictions, especially for
$^4$He abundance. Also, the effects on the lower bound of the reheating
temperature from cosmological observations are discussed.",2005-05-19T07:26:54Z
The BeppoSAX catalog of GRB X-ray afterglow observations,"We present the X-ray afterglow catalog of BeppoSAX from the launch of the
satellite to the end of the mission. Thirty-three X-ray afterglows were
securely identified based on their fading behavior out of 39 observations. We
have extracted the continuum parameters (decay index, spectral index, flux,
absorption) for all available afterglows. We point out a possible correlation
between the X-ray afterglow luminosity and the energy emitted during the prompt
$\gamma$-ray event. We do not detect a significant jet signature within the
afterglows, implying a lower limit on the beaming angle, neither a standard
energy release when X-ray fluxes are corrected for beaming. Our data support
the hypothesis that the burst should be surrounded by an interstellar medium
rather than a wind environment, and that this environment should be dense. This
may be explained by a termination shock located near the burst progenitor. We
finally point out that some dark bursts may be explained by an intrinsic
faintness of the event, while others may be strongly absorbed.",2005-07-29T16:23:52Z
"Tentative Identification of Interstellar Dust in the Nose of the
  Heliosphere","Observations of the weak polarization of light from nearby stars, reported by
Tinbergen (1982), are consistent with polarization by small, radius <0.14
microm, interstellar dust grains entrained in the magnetic wall of the
heliosphere. The direction of maximum polarization is offset by ~35 deg from
the heliosphere nose, and extends to low ecliptic latitudes. An offset is found
between the direction of the best aligned dust grains, and the upwind direction
of the undeflected large interstellar grains seen by Ulysses and Galileo. In
the aligned-grain region, the strength of polarization anti-correlates with
ecliptic latitude, indicating that the magnetic wall is predominantly at
negative ecliptic latitudes, which is consistent with predictions of Linde
(1998). These data are consistent with an interstellar magnetic field tilt of
60 deg with respect to the ecliptic plane, and parallel to the galactic plane.
Interstellar dust grains captured in the heliosheath may also introduce a weak,
but important, large scale contaminant for the cosmic microwave background
signal with a symmetry consistent with the relative tilts of \Bis and the
ecliptic.",2005-06-13T22:30:30Z
"Color Gradients in Early-type Galaxies: Dependence on Environment and
  Redshift","Color gradients in early-type galaxies contain valuable clues about their
formation and evolutionary histories and mechanisms. We examine color gradients
in 1,700 early-type galaxies in 159 galaxy clusters spanning a redshift range
of 0.05 to 0.2. We find that color gradients strongly depend on the environment
where galaxies reside, with steeper color gradients in poor rather than rich
clusters. No dependence of color gradients on galaxy luminosity is found in
either rich or poor clusters. The difference in color gradients can be
explained by a change in the internal metallicity and/or an age gradient in
these galaxies. Our results support a reasonable picture whereby young
early-type galaxies form in a dissipative collapse process, and then undergo
increased (either major or minor) merging activity in richer rather than in
poor clusters.",2005-04-28T09:27:20Z
"Multipole vector anomalies in the first-year WMAP data: a cut-sky
  analysis","We apply the recently defined multipole vector framework to the
frequency-specific first-year WMAP sky maps, estimating the low-l multipole
coefficients from the high-latitude sky by means of a power equalization
filter. While most previous analyses of this type have considered only heavily
processed (and foreground-contaminated) full-sky maps, the present approach
allows for greater control of residual foregrounds, and therefore potentially
also for cosmologically important conclusions. The low-l spherical harmonics
coefficients and corresponding multipole vectors are tabulated for easy
reference.
  Using this formalism, we re-assess a set of earlier claims of both
cosmological and non-cosmological low-l correlations based on multipole
vectors. First, we show that the apparent l=3 and 8 correlation claimed by Copi
et al. (2004) is present only in the heavily processed map produced by Tegmark
et al. (2003), and must therefore be considered an artifact of that map.
Second, the well-known quadrupole-octopole correlation is confirmed at the 99%
significance level, and shown to be robust with respect to frequency and sky
cut. Previous claims are thus supported by our analysis. Finally, the low-l
alignment with respect to the ecliptic claimed by Schwarz et al. (2004) is
nominally confirmed in this analysis, but also shown to be very dependent on
severe a-posteriori choices. Indeed, we show that given the peculiar
quadrupole-octopole arrangement, finding such a strong alignment with the
ecliptic is not unusual.",2005-07-08T16:27:55Z
"Recovery of the orbital parameters and pulse evolution of V0332+53
  during a huge outburst","The high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) V0332+53 became active at the end of 2004
and the outburst was observed at hard X-rays by RXTE and INTEGRAL. Based on
these hard X-ray observations, the orbital parameters are measured through
fitting the Doppler-shifted spin periods. The derived orbital period and
eccentricity are consistent with those of Stella et al. (1985) obtained from
EXOSAT observations, whereas the projected semimajor axis and the periastron
longitude are found to have changed from 48$\pm$4 to 86$^{+6}_{-10}$ lt-s and
from 313$^{\circ}$$\pm$10 to 283$^{\circ}$$\pm$14, respectively. This would
indicate an angular speed of $\geq$ 1.5$^{\circ}$$\pm$0.8 yr$^{-1}$ for
rotation of the orbit over the past 21 years. The periastron passage time of
MJD 53367$\pm$1 is just around the time when the intensity reached maximum and
an orbital period earlier is the time when the outburst started. This
correlation resembles the behavior of a Type I outburst. During outburst the
source spun up with a rate of 8.01$^{+1.00}_{-1.14}$$\times10^{-6}$ s
day$^{-1}$. The evolution of pulse profile is highly intensity dependent. The
separation of double pulses remained almost constant ($\sim$ 0.47) when the
source was bright, and dropped to 0.37 within $\leq$ 3 days as the source
became weaker. The pulse evolution of V0332+53 may correlate to the change in
dominance of the emission between fan-beam and pencil-beam mechanisms.",2005-07-20T07:09:49Z
Unifying XRFs and GRBs with a Fisher-Shaped Universal Jet Model,"We show analytically that GRB jets with an emissivity profile given by the
Fisher distribution, epsilon(theta) = A * e^(B cos(theta)), have the unique
property of producing equal numbers of bursts per logarithmic interval in Eiso,
and therefore in most burst properties. Since this broad distribution of burst
properties is a key feature found by HETE-2, a Fisher-shaped universal jet
model can explain many of the observed properties of XRFs, X-ray-rich GRBs, and
GRBs reasonably well, in contrast to a power-law universal model. For small
viewing angles, the Fisher distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian,
whose properties have been explored by Zhang et al. (2004). We also show that
the Fisher universal jet model produces a broad distribution in the inferred
radiated energy Egamma_inf, in contrast to the narrow distribution predicted by
the uniform variable opening-angle jet model Lamb, Donaghy & Graziani (2005).
Here we present Monte Carlo simulations of both a Fisher-shaped universal jet
model and a Fisher-shaped variable opening-angle jet model.",2005-05-08T16:49:45Z
"A Compiled Catalogue of Spectroscopically Determined Elemental
  Abundances for Stars with Accurate Parallaxes. I.Magnesium","We present a compiled catalogue of effective temperatures, surface gravities,
iron and magnesium abundances, distances, velocity components, and orbital
elements for stars in the solar neighborhood. The atmospheric parameters and
iron abundances are averages of published values derived from model synthetic
spectra for a total of about 2000 values in 80 publications. Our relative
magnesium abundances were found from 1412 values in 31 publications for 876
dwarfs and subgiants using a three-step iteration averaging procedure, with
weights assigned to each source of data as well as to each individual
determination and taking into account systematic deviations of each scale
relative to the reduced mean scale. The estimated assumed completeness for data
sources containing more than five stars, up to late December 2003, exceeds 90%.
For the vast majority of stars in the catalogue, the spatial velocity
components were derived from modern high-precision astrometric observations,
and their Galactic orbit elements were computed using a three-component model
of the Galaxy, consisting of a disk, a bulge, and a massive extended halo.",2005-03-28T15:51:59Z
Pulsating stars in the ASAS-3 database. I. Beta Cephei stars,"We present results of an analysis of the ASAS-3 data for short-period
variables from the recently published catalogue of over 38 000 stars. Using the
data available in the literature we verify the results of the automatic
classification related to $\beta$ Cephei pulsators. In particular, we find that
14 stars in the catalogue can be classified unambiguously as new $\beta$ Cephei
stars. By means of periodogram analysis we derive the frequencies and
amplitudes of the excited modes. The main modes in the new $\beta$ Cephei stars
have large semi-amplitudes, between 35 and 80 mmag. Up to four modes were found
in some stars. Two (maybe three) new $\beta$ Cephei stars are members of
southern young open clusters: ASAS 164409-4719.1 belongs to NGC 6200, ASAS
164630-4701.2 is a member of Hogg 22, and ASAS 164939-4431.7 could be a member
of NGC 6216.
  We also analyze the photometry of four known $\beta$ Cephei stars in the
ASAS-3 catalogue, namely IL Vel, NSV 24078, V1449 Aql and SY Equ. Finally, we
discuss the distribution of $\beta$ Cephei stars in the Galaxy.",2005-06-14T17:12:02Z
"STEREO ARRAY of 30 m Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes: A
  Next-Generation Detector for Ground-Based High Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy","The construction of the H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System), a
superior system of four 12 m imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, has been
completed recently in the Namib desert close to Windhoek, at 1800 m above sea
level. This new generation of ground-based gamma-ray detectors has an energy
threshold of about 100 GeV in observations at zenith and a sensitivity of about
1% Crab flux for a point-like gamma-ray source. Such high sensitivity was
achieved due to 0.1 degree angular resolution, as well as, severe cosmic ray
background rejection acquired from multi-fold imaging of individual atmospheric
showers. In addition H.E.S.S. has a rather good energy resolution of 15%.
H.E.S.S. has been taking routine observations of the gamma-ray sources since
December 2003. The outstanding physics results achieved with H.E.S.S. already
in a first year of its exploitation strongly encourage further development of
imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique for high-quality gamma-ray
observations, which is basically driven by father reduction of the energy
threshold of a forthcoming major future gamma-ray detector. Here we are dealing
with such a detector. Basic results on performance and sensitivity for a single
stand-alone 30 m imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope, as well as for a
system of two and five telescopes, are discussed here.",2005-06-20T17:12:15Z
"KASCADE measurements of energy spectra for elemental groups of cosmic
  rays: Results and open problems","A composition analysis of KASCADE air shower data is performed by means of
unfolding the two-dimensional frequency spectrum of electron and muon numbers.
Aim of the analysis is the determination of energy spectra for elemental groups
representing the chemical composition of primary cosmic rays. Since such an
analysis depends crucially on simulations of air showers the two different
hadronic interaction models QGSJet and SIBYLL are used for their generation.
The resulting primary energy spectra show that the knee in the all particle
spectrum is due to a steepening of the spectra of light elements but, also,
that neither of the two simulation sets is able to describe the measured data
consistently over the whole energy range with discrepancies appearing in
different energy regions.",2005-05-19T16:28:45Z
"Stochastic chemical enrichment in metal-poor systems II. Abundance
  ratios and scatter","A stochastic model of the chemical enrichment of metal-poor systems by
core-collapse supernovae is used to study the scatter in stellar abundance
ratios. The resulting scatter in abundance ratios, e.g. as functions of the
overall metallicity, is demonstrated to be crucially dependent on the as yet
uncertain supernovae yields. The observed abundance ratios and their scatters
therefore have diagnostic power as regards the yields. The relatively small
star-to-star scatter observed in many chemical abundance ratios, e.g. by Cayrel
et al. (2004) for stars down to [Fe/H] = -4, is tentatively explained by the
averaging of a large number of contributing supernovae and by the cosmic
selection effects favoring contributions from supernovae in a certain mass
range for the most metal-poor stars. The scatter in observed abundances of
alpha-elements is understood in terms of observational errors only, while
additional spread in yields or sites of nucleosynthesis may affect the odd-even
elements Na and Al. For the iron-group elements we find systematically too high
predicted Cr/Fe and Cr/Mg ratios, as well as differences between the different
sets of yields, both in terms of predicted abundance ratios and scatter. The
semi-empirical yields recently suggested by Francois et al. (2004) are found to
lead to scatter in abundance ratios significantly greater than observed, when
applied in the inhomogeneous models. ""Spurs"", very narrow sequences in
abundance-ratio diagrams, may disclose a single-supernova origin of the
elements of the stars on the sequence. Verification of the existence of such
features, called single supernova sequences (SSSs), is challenging. This will
require samples of several hundred stars with abundance ratios observed to
accuracies of 0.05 dex or better.",2005-04-27T20:39:05Z
"Search for nearby stars among proper motion stars selected by
  optical-to-infrared photometry III. Spectroscopic distances of 322 NLTT stars","Distance estimates based on low-resolution spectroscopy and Two Micron All
Sky Survey (2MASS) J magnitudes are presented for a large sample of 322 nearby
candidates from Luyten's NLTT catalogue. Mainly relatively bright (typically 7
< K_s < 11) and red high proper motion stars have been selected according to
their 2MASS magnitudes and optical-to-infrared colours (+1 < R-K_s < +7). Some
LHS stars previously lacking spectroscopy have also been included. We have
classified the majority of the objects as early-M dwarfs (M2-M5). More than 70%
of our targets turned out to lie within the 25 pc horizon of the catalogue of
nearby stars, with 50 objects placed within 15 pc and 8 objects being closer
than 10 pc. Three objects in the 10 pc sample have no previously published
spectral type: LP 876-10 (M4), LP 870-65 (M4.5), and LP 869-26 (M5). A large
fraction of the objects in our sample (57%) have independent distance
estimates, mainly by the recent efforts of Reid and collaborators. Our distance
determinations are generally in good agreement with theirs. 11 rather distant
(d > 100 pc) objects have also been identified, including a probable halo, but
relatively hot (T_eff = 13000 K) white dwarf (LHS 1200) and 10 red dwarfs with
extremely large tangential velocities (250 < v_t < 1150 km/s). Altogether,
there are 11 red dwarfs (including one within 70 pc) with tangential velocities
larger than about 250 km/s. All these objects are suspected to be in fact
subdwarfs, if so, their distances would be only about half of our original
estimates. The three most extreme objects in that respect are the K and early M
dwarfs LP 323-168, LHS 5343 and LP 552-21 with corrected distances between 180
pc and 400 pc and resulting tangential velocities still larger than about 400
km/s.",2005-07-12T13:17:56Z
"A Multi-wavelength View of the TeV Blazar Markarian 421: Correlated
  Variability, Flaring, and Spectral Evolution","We report results from a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign on Mrk 421 over
the period of 2003-2004. The source was observed simultaneously at TeV and
X-ray energies, with supporting observations frequently carried out at optical
and radio wavelengths. The large amount of simultaneous data has allowed us to
examine the variability of Mrk 421 in detail. The variabilities are generally
correlated between the X-ray and gamma-ray bands, although the correlation
appears to be fairly loose. The light curves show the presence of flares with
varying amplitudes on a wide range of timescales both at X-ray and TeV
energies. Of particular interest is the presence of TeV flares that have no
coincident counterparts at longer wavelengths, because the phenomenon seems
difficult to understand in the context of the proposed emission models for TeV
blazars. We have also found that the TeV flux reached its peak days before the
X-ray flux during a giant flare in 2004. Such a difference in the development
of the flare presents a further challenge to the emission models. Mrk 421
varied much less at optical and radio wavelengths. Surprisingly, the normalized
variability amplitude in optical seems to be comparable to that in radio,
perhaps suggesting the presence of different populations of emitting electrons
in the jet. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of Mrk 421 is seen to vary
with flux, with the two characteristic peaks moving toward higher energies at
higher fluxes. We have failed to fit the measured SEDs with a one-zone SSC
model; introducing additional zones greatly improves the fits. We have derived
constraints on the physical properties of the X-ray/gamma-ray flaring regions
from the observed variability (and SED) of the source. The implications of the
results are discussed. (Abridged)",2005-05-16T16:16:03Z
"Black hole-neutron star binaries in general relativity: effects of
  neutron star spin","We present new sequences of general relativistic, quasiequilibrium black
hole-neutron star binaries. We solve for the gravitational field in the
conformal thin-sandwich decomposition of Einstein's field equations, coupled to
the equations of relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium for a perfect fluid. We
account for the black hole by solving these equations in the background metric
of a Schwarzschild black hole whose mass is much larger than that of the
neutron star. The background metric is treated in Kerr-Schild as well as
isotropic coordinates. For the neutron star, we assume a polytropic equation of
state with adiabatic index Gamma=2, and solve for both irrotational and
corotational configurations. By comparing the results of irrotational and
synchronized configurations with the same background metric, we conclude that
the effect of the rotation on the location of tidal break-up is only on the
order of a few percent. The different choices in the background also lead to
differences of order a few percent, which may be an indication of the level to
which these configurations approximate quasiequilibrium.",2005-05-20T20:00:12Z
"Robust determination of optical path difference: fringe tracking at the
  IOTA interferometer","We describe the fringe packet tracking system used to equalise the optical
path lengths at the Infrared Optical Telescope Array (IOTA) interferometer. The
measurement of closure phases requires obtaining fringes on three baselines
simultaneously. This is accomplished using an algorithm based on double Fourier
interferometry for obtaining the wavelength-dependent phase of the fringes and
a group delay tracking algorithm for determining the position of the fringe
packet. The comparison between data acquired with and without the fringe packet
tracker shows about a factor 3 reduction of the error on the closure-phase
measurement. The fringe packet tracker has been able so far to track fringes of
signal-to-noise as low as 1.8 for stars as faint as mH=7.0.",2005-04-05T21:23:01Z
"Oxygen isotopic ratios in galactic clouds along the line of sight
  towards Sagittarius B2","As an independent check on previous measurements of the isotopic abundance of
oxygen through the Galaxy, we present a detailed analysis of the ground state
rotational lines of 16OH and 18OH in absorption towards the giant molecular
cloud complex, Sagittarius B2. We have modelled the line shapes to separate the
contribution of several galactic clouds along the line of sight and calculate
16OH/18OH ratios for each of these features. The best fitting values are in the
range 320-540, consistent with the previous measurements in the Galactic Disk
but slightly higher than the standard ratio in the Galactic Centre. They do not
show clear evidence for a gradient in the isotopic ratio with galactocentric
distance. The individual 16OH column densities relative to water give ratios of
[H2O/OH]=0.6-1.2, similar in magnitude to galactic clouds in the sight lines
towards W51 and W49. A comparison with CH indicates [OH/CH] ratios higher than
has been previously observed in diffuse clouds. We estimate OH abundances of
10^-7 - 10^-6 in the line of sight features.",2005-04-07T10:27:20Z
"Confidence limits of evolutionary synthesis models. IV Moving forward to
  a probabilistic formulation","Synthesis models predict the integrated properties of stellar populations.
Several problems exist in this field, mostly related to the fact that
integrated properties are distributed. To date, this aspect has been either
ignored (as in standard synthesis models, which are inherently deterministic)
or interpreted phenomenologically (as in Monte Carlo simulations, which
describe distributed properties rather than explain them). We approach
population synthesis as a problem in probability theory, in which stellar
luminosities are random variables extracted from the stellar luminosity
distribution function (sLDF). We derive the population LDF (pLDF) for clusters
of any size from the sLDF, obtaining the scale relations that link the sLDF to
the pLDF. We recover the predictions of standard synthesis models, which are
shown to compute the mean of the sLDF. We provide diagnostic diagrams and a
simplified recipe for testing the statistical richness of observed clusters,
thereby assessing whether standard synthesis models can be safely used or a
statistical treatment is mandatory. We also recover the predictions of Monte
Carlo simulations, with the additional bonus of being able to interpret them in
mathematical and physical terms. We give examples of problems that can be
addressed through our probabilistic formalism. Though still under development,
ours is a powerful approach to population synthesis. In an era of resolved
observations and pipelined analyses of large surveys, this paper is offered as
a signpost in the field of stellar populations.",2005-04-21T20:00:15Z
"Growth of Hydrodynamic Perturbations in Accretion Disks: Possible Route
  to Non-Magnetic Turbulence","We study the possible origin of hydrodynamic turbulence in cold accretion
disks such as those in star-forming systems and quiescent cataclysmic
variables. As these systems are expected to have neutral gas, the turbulent
viscosity is likely to be hydrodynamic in origin, not magnetohydrodynamic.
Therefore MRI will be sluggish or even absent in such disks. Although there are
no exponentially growing eigenmodes in a hydrodynamic disk, because of the
non-normal nature of the eigenmodes, a large transient growth in the energy is
still possible, which may enable the system to switch to a turbulent state. For
a Keplerian disk, we estimate that the energy will grow by a factor of 1000 for
a Reynolds number close to a million.",2005-07-02T01:53:08Z
The Low-Redshift Lyman Alpha Forest toward PKS 0405-123,"We present STIS 7km/s resolution data of the Ly-a forest toward PKS0405-123
(z=0.574). We make two samples. The strong sample (60 systems) has column
density logNHI>13.3 over 0.002<z<0.423, and the weak sample (44) has
logNHI>13.1 at 0.020<z<0.234; 7 absorbers show metals, all with OVI, but often
offset in velocity from HI. The strong sample Doppler parameters show
<b>=47+-22km/s; for the weak, <b>=44+-21km/s. Line blending and s/n effects
likely inflate b. The redshift density dN/dz is consistent with previous, lower
resolution results for logNHI>14.0. For 13.1<logNHI<14.0, we find a dN/dz
overdensity of ~0.2-0.3 dex at 0.127<z<0.234, which we believe arises from
cosmic variance. We find Ly-a clustering over Delta v<250km/s for logNHI>13.3,
consistent with a numerical model. There is a void in the strong sample at
0.0320<z<0.0814. We detect radial velocity correlations for Delta v<250km/s
between Ly-a absorbers and 39 galaxies in a 10' field. The correlation grows
with minimum NHI, peaking for logNHI ~> 13.5-14.0. The strength is similar to
that of the galaxy-galaxy correlation for our sample, implying that such Ly-a
systems have mass log M/Msun= 11.3+1.0-0.6. Including lower column density
systems in the sample shows correlations only out to Delta v <125km/s, as would
be expected for smaller density perturbations. Galaxy counts and local HI
column density appear correlated, peaking at ~5000km/s. We also give column
densities for Galactic species. (Abridged)",2005-05-29T21:40:21Z
The inflationary prediction for primordial non-gaussianity,"We extend the \delta N formalism so that it gives all of the stochastic
properties of the primordial curvature perturbation \zeta if the initial field
perturbations are gaussian. The calculation requires only the knowledge of some
family of unperturbed universes. A formula is given for the normalisation \fnl
of the bispectrum of \zeta, which is the main signal of non-gaussianity.
Examples of the use of the formula are given, and its relation to cosmological
perturbation theory is explained.",2005-04-02T21:44:44Z
Secular Evolution of Galaxies,"In current $\Lambda$CDM galaxy formation scenarios, at least three physical
phenomena could contribute to the mass assembly: monolithic collapse,
hierarchical mergers and more quiescent external gas accretion, with secular
evolution. The three processes are described, and their successes and problems
are reviewed. It is shown that monolithic collapse is likely to be quite
restricted to sub-components of galaxies, while the two main scenarii,
hierarchical merging and secular evolution, might have comparable roles,
depending on environment. Evidences are reviewed for the important role of gas
accretion, followed by secular evolution. In particular the existence of thin
and cold disks, the occurence of bars and spiral structure, the frequency of
lopsided instabilities, and the history of star formation, all point towards
large amounts of cold gas accretion. Some examples of N-body simulations are
reviewed in support of secular evolution.",2005-06-13T09:19:49Z
The Limits of Quintessence,"We present evidence that the simplest particle-physics scalar-field models of
dynamical dark energy can be separated into distinct behaviors based on the
acceleration or deceleration of the field as it evolves down its potential
towards a zero minimum. We show that these models occupy narrow regions in the
phase-plane of w and w', the dark energy equation-of-state and its
time-derivative in units of the Hubble time. Restricting an energy scale of the
dark energy microphysics limits how closely a scalar field can resemble a
cosmological constant. These results, indicating a desired measurement
resolution of order \sigma(w')\approx (1+w), define firm targets for
observational tests of the physics of dark energy.",2005-05-24T20:00:12Z
"Structural Parameters of the Hot Pulsating B Subdwarf PG 1219+534 from
  Asteroseismology","We have carried out a detailed asteroseismic analysis of PG 1219+534. Our
analysis leads to the identification of the (k,l) indices of nine periods
observed in the star PG 1219+534, and to the determination of its structural
parameters. The periods all correspond to low-order acoustic modes with
adjacent values of k and with l=0, 1, 2, and 3. They define a band of unstable
modes, in close agreement with nonadiabatic pulsation theory. Furthermore, the
average dispersion between the nine observed periods and the periods of the
corresponding nine theoretical modes of the optimal model is only ~0.6%,
comparable to the results of a similar analysis carried out by Brassard et al.
(2001) on the rapid sdB pulsator PG 0014+067. On the basis of our combined
spectroscopic and asteroseismic analysis, the inferred global structural
parameters of PG 1219+534 are Teff = 33,600 +/- 370 K, log g = 5.8071 +/-
0.0057, log Menv/M* = -4.254 +/- 0.147, M* = 0.457 +/- 0.012 Msun, R/Rsun =
0.1397 +/- 0.0028, and L/Lsun = 22.01 +/- 1.85. Combined with detailed model
atmosphere calculations, we estimate, in addition, that this star has an
absolute visual magnitude MV = 4.62 +/- 0.06 and is located at a distance d =
531 +/- 23 pc (using V = 13.24 +/- 0.20). Finally, if we interpret the absence
of fine structure (frequency multiplets) as indicative of a slow rotation rate
of that star, we further find that PG 1219+534 rotates with a period longer
than 3.4 days, and has a maximum rotational broadening velocity of Vsin i <~
2.1 km/s.",2005-03-17T17:46:01Z
The Vertical Structure of Stars in Edge-on Galaxies,"We present a summary of our recent work on the vertical distribution of the
resolved stellar populations in six low mass, edge-on, spiral galaxies observed
with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS). In each
galaxy we find evidence for an extraplanar stellar component extending up to 15
scale heights (~3.5 kpc) above the plane. We analyze the vertical distribution
as a function of stellar age by tracking changes in the color-magnitude
diagram. The young stellar component (< 10^8 yrs) is found to have a scale
height larger than the young component in the Milky Way, suggesting that stars
in these low mass galaxies form in a thicker disk. We also find that the scale
height of a stellar population increases with age, with young main sequence
stars, intermediate age asymptotic giant branch stars, and old red giant branch
stars having succesively larger scale heights in each galaxy. The color
distributions of the red giant branch (RGB) stars well above the midplane
indicate that the extended stellar components we see are moderately metal-poor,
with peak metallicities of [Fe/H] ~ -1 and with little or no metallicity
gradient with height. The lack of metallicity gradient can be explained if a
majority of extraplanar RGB stars were formed at early times and are not
dominated by a younger heated population. Our observations suggest that, like
the Milky Way, low mass disk galaxies also have multiple stellar components. We
examine our results in light of disk heating and merger scenarios and conclude
that both mechanisms likely played a role in forming the disks of our sample
galaxies.",2005-06-17T21:57:27Z
An old quasar in a young dark energy-dominated universe?,"Dark energy is the invisible fuel that seems to drive the current
acceleration of the Universe. Its presence, which is inferred from an
impressive convergence of high-quality observational results along with some
apparently sucessful theoretical predictions, is also supported by the current
estimates of the age of the Universe from dating of local and high-$z$ objects.
In this paper we test the viability of several dark energy scenarios in the
light of the age estimates of the high redshift ($z=3.91$) quasar APM
08279+5255. Using a chemodinamical model for the evolution of spheroids, we
first reevaluate its current estimated age, as given by Hasinger et al. (2002).
An age of 2.1 Gyr is set by the condition that Fe/O abundance ratio (normalized
to solar values) of the model reaches 3.3, which is the best fit value obtained
in the above reference. It is shown that for the currently accepted value of
the matter density parameter, most of the existing dark energy scenarios cannot
accomodate this old high redshift object unless the Hubble parameter is as low
as $H_o = 58$ $\rm{km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}}$, as recently advocated by Sandage and
collaborators. Even considering less stringent age limits, only cosmological
models that predicts a considerably old Universe at high-$z$ can be compatible
with the existence of this object. This is the case of the conventional
$\Lambda$CDM scenario and some specific classes of brane world cosmologies.",2005-04-01T17:47:50Z
"Detection of steam in the circumstellar disk around a massive Young
  Stellar Object","We report on the observation of hot water vapor (steam) in the inner AU of a
young massive star located in the star-forming region IRAS 08576-4334. The
water lines are detected in a medium resolution (R=10,000) K-band spectrum
taken by the infrared spectrometer ISAAC mounted on the VLT-ANTU. The water
vapor is at a mean temperature of 1565+/-510 K, cooler than the hot CO found in
the same object, which is at 1660K and the column density is N(H2O)=(2.5 +/-
0.4)x1E18 cm-2. The profile of both H2O and CO lines is best reproduced by the
emission from a Keplerian disk. To interpret the data, we also investigate the
formation of molecules and especially CO and water vapor in the inner hot and
dense part of disks around young high mass stars using a pseudo time-dependent
gas-phase chemical model. Molecules are rapidly photodissociated but this
destruction is compensated by an efficient formation due to fast
neutral-neutral reactions. The ability of CO molecules to self-shield
significantly enhances its abundance. Water molecules are sufficiently abundant
to be detectable. The observed H2O/CO ratio is reproduced by gas at 1600K and
an enhanced UV field over gas density ratio I_UV/nH=1E(-4)- 1E(-6). The
simulations support the presence of CO and H2O molecules in the inner disks
around young massive stars despite the strong UV radiation and show that the OH
radical plays an essential role in hot gas chemistry.",2005-03-24T16:18:08Z
The faint-end of the galaxy luminosity function in groups,"We compute the galaxy luminosity function in spectroscopically selected
nearby groups and clusters. Our sample comprises 728 systems extracted from the
third release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the redshift range $0.03 < z <
0.06$ with virial mass range $10^{11}M_\odot < M_{vir} < 2\times
10^{14}M_\odot$. In order to compute the galaxy luminosity function, we apply a
statistical background subtraction method following usually adopted techniques.
In the $r$ band, the composite galaxy luminosity function shows a slope
$\alpha=-1.3$ in the bright--end, and an upturn of the slope in the faint--end,
$M_r\ga -18+5log(h)$, to slopes $-1.9<\alpha<-1.6$. We find that this feature
is present also in the $i,g$ and $z$ bands, and for all explored group
subsamples, irrespective of the group mass, number of members, integrated color
or the presence of a hot intra-cluster gas associated to X-ray emission.",2005-07-06T18:11:32Z
"Deep Photometry of the Globular Cluster M5: Distance Estimates from
  White Dwarf and Main Sequence Stars","We present deep VI photometry of stars in the globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904)
based on images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting
color-magnitude diagram reaches below V ~ 27 mag, revealing the upper 2-3
magnitudes of the white dwarf cooling sequence, and main sequence stars eight
magnitudes and more below the turn-off. We fit the main sequence to subdwarfs
of known parallax to obtain a true distance modulus of (m-M)_0 = 14.45 +/- 0.11
mag. A second distance estimate based on fitting the cluster white dwarf
sequence to field white dwarfs with known parallax yielded (m-M)_0 = 14.67 +/-
0.18 mag. We couple our distance estimates with extensive photometry of the
cluster's RR Lyrae variables to provide a calibration of the RR Lyrae absolute
magnitude yielding M_V(RR) = 0.42 +/- 0.10 mag at [Fe/H] = -1.11 dex. We
provide another luminosity calibration in the form of reddening-free Wasenheit
functions. Comparison of our calibrations with predictions based on recent
models combining stellar evolution and pulsation theories shows encouraging
agreement. (Abridged)",2005-06-29T15:42:19Z
The tidal stripping of satellites,"We present an improved analytic calculation for the tidal radius of
satellites and test our results against N-body simulations.
  The tidal radius in general depends upon four factors: the potential of the
host galaxy, the potential of the satellite, the orbit of the satellite and
{\it the orbit of the star within the satellite}. We demonstrate that this last
point is critical and suggest using {\it three tidal radii} to cover the range
of orbits of stars within the satellite. In this way we show explicitly that
prograde star orbits will be more easily stripped than radial orbits; while
radial orbits are more easily stripped than retrograde ones. This result has
previously been established by several authors numerically, but can now be
understood analytically. For point mass, power-law (which includes the
isothermal sphere), and a restricted class of split power law potentials our
solution is fully analytic. For more general potentials, we provide an equation
which may be rapidly solved numerically. Over short times ($\simlt 1-2$ Gyrs
$\sim 1$ satellite orbit), we find excellent agreement between our analytic and
numerical models. Over longer times, star orbits within the satellite are
transformed by the tidal field of the host galaxy. In a Hubble time, this
causes a convergence of the three limiting tidal radii towards the prograde
stripping radius. Beyond the prograde stripping radius, the velocity dispersion
will be tangentially anisotropic.",2005-06-28T09:45:49Z
Spatially Resolved Spectral Analysis of Vela Shrapnel D,"The ROSAT all-sky survey discovered several `shrapnels', showing boomerang
structures outside the Vela supernova remnant. We observed shrapnel D with the
XMM-Newton satellite. There is an X-ray bright ridge structure in our FOV
running from north to south. Applying the VNEI model to X-ray spectra of
various regions, we find that the plasma in the eastern part from the X-ray
ridge is significantly different from that in the western part. The X-ray
spectra in the western part can be represented by a single-temperature
component. The abundances of heavy elements are almost uniform, whereas they
are heavily overabundant, except for Fe; the relative abundances to the solar
values are O about 5, Ne about 10, Mg about 10, Fe about 1. This indicates that
shrapnel D originated from the ejecta of the supernova. We find that the plasma
in the eastern part from the ridge consists of two components with different
temperatures; the hot component comes from the ejecta, while the cold component
comes from the interstellar matter. These two components are considered to be
in contact with each other, forming a contact discontinuity. Around the
northern part of the contact discontinuity, we find wave-like structures of
which the typical scale are comparable with that of the Rayleigh--Taylor
instability.",2005-07-14T13:30:57Z
"VLT K-band spectroscopy of massive stars deeply embedded in IRAS sources
  with UCHII colours","We have obtained high resolution (R = 10,000) K-band spectra of candidate
young massive stars deeply embedded in (ultra-) compact HII regions (UCHIIs).
In these clusters, three types of objects are identified. The first type (38
objects) consists of ``naked'' OB stars whose K-band spectra are dominated by
photospheric emission. We classify the K-band spectra of the OB-type cluster
members using near-infrared classification criteria. The spectral
classification provides an important constraint on the distance to the embedded
cluster. The ionising power of the population thus derived is compared to the
information obtained from the infrared and radio flux of these sources. In most
cases these two different determinations of the ionising flux are consistent,
from which we conclude that we have identified the ionising star(s) in about
50% of the embedded clusters. The second type (7 objects) are point sources
associated with UCHII radio emission, that exhibit nebular emission lines in
the near-infrared. Six of the objects in this group produce HeI emission
indicative of an embedded O-type star. These objects are more embedded than the
OB stars and probably do not dominate the infrared flux as measured by IRAS.
The third type (20 objects) is characterised by broad (100--200 km/s) Brgamma
emission and no photospheric absorption profiles. Bik et al (2005) show that
these objects are massive YSO candidates surrounded by dense circumstellar
disks.",2005-05-13T18:03:55Z
Superstellar clusters and their impact on their host galaxies,"We review the properties of young superstellar clusters and the impact that
their evolution has in their host galaxies. In particular we look at the two
different star-forming feedback modes: positive and negative feedback. The
development of strong isotropic winds emanating from massive clusters, capable
of disrupting the remains of the parental cloud as well as causing the
large-scale restructuring of the surrounding ISM, has usually been taken as a
negative feedback agent. Here we show the impact that radiative cooling has on
the resultant outflows and then, as an extreme example, we infer from the
observations of M82 the detailed inner structure of supergalactic winds and
define through numerical simulations the ingredients required to match such
structures.We also show how when radiative cooling becomes significant within
the star cluster volume itself (~ 30% of the deposited energy), the force of
gravity takes over and drives in situ all the matter deposited by winds and
supernovae into several generations of star formation. A situation in which the
mass deposition rate from the star cluster instead of causing a wind as in the
adiabatic solution, turns into a positive feedback star-forming mode equal to
the star formation rate.",2005-06-06T19:37:16Z
Rapid growth of high redshift black holes,"We discuss a model for the early assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical build-up far up in the
dark halo `merger tree'. Motivated by the observations of luminous quasars
around redshift z=6 with SMBH masses of billion solar masses, we assess the
possibility of an early phase of stable super-critical quasi-spherical
accretion in the BHs hosted by metal free halos with virial temperature larger
than 10000 K. We assume that the first `seed' black holes formed with
intermediate masses following the collapse of the first generation of stars, in
mini-halos collapsing at z=20-30 from high peaks of density fluctuations. In
high redshift halos with virial temperature larger than 10000 K, conditions
exist for the formation of a fat disc of gas at T_gas=5000-10000 K. Cooling via
hydrogen atomic lines is in fact effective in these comparatively massive
halos. The cooling and collapse of an initially spherical configuration of gas
leads to a rotationally supported disc at the center of the halo if baryons
preserve their specific angular momentum during collapse. The conditions for
the formation of the gas disc and accretion onto a central black holes out of
this supply of gas are investigated, as well as the feedback of the emission
onto the host and onto the intergalactic medium. We find that even a short
phase of supercritical accretion eases the requirements set by the z=6 quasars.",2005-06-02T14:38:08Z
"Atmosphere, Interior, and Evolution of the Metal-Rich Transiting Planet
  HD 149026b","We investigate the atmosphere and interior of the new transiting planet HD
149026b, which appears to be very rich in heavy elements. We first compute
model atmospheres at metallicities ranging from solar to ten times solar, and
show how for cases with high metallicity or inefficient redistribution of
energy from the day side, the planet may develop a hot stratosphere due to
absorption of stellar flux by TiO and VO. The spectra predicted by these models
are very different than cooler atmosphere models without stratospheres. The
spectral effects are potentially detectable with the Spitzer Space Telescope.
In addition the models with hot stratospheres lead to a large limb brightening,
rather than darkening. We compare the atmosphere of HD 149026b to other
well-known transiting planets, including the recently discovered HD 189733b,
which we show have planet-to-star flux ratios twice that of HD 209458 and
TrES-1. The methane abundance in the atmosphere of HD 189733b is a sensitive
indicator of atmospheric temperature and metallicity and can be constrained
with Spitzer IRAC observations. We then turn to interior studies of HD 149026b
and use a grid of self-consistent model atmospheres and high-pressure equations
of state for all components to compute thermal evolution models of the planet.
We estimate that the mass of heavy elements within the planet is in the range
of 60 to 93 M_earth. Finally, we discuss trends in the radii of transiting
planets with metallicity in light of this new member of the class.",2005-07-18T21:49:23Z
The bound $r \leq 16ε$ on the primordial tensor perturbation,"I recall the well-known sufficient conditions for the bound $r<16\epsilon$ on
the spectrum of the primordial tensor perturbation. Two recent papers claim a

sufficient conditions.",2005-08-04T08:43:42Z
"NGC 146: A young open cluster with a Herbig Be star and intermediate
  mass pre-main sequence stars","We present UBV CCD photometry and low-resolution spectra of stars in the
field of the young open cluster NGC 146. UBV photometry of 434 stars were used
to estimate the E(B$-$V) reddening of 0.55 $\pm$ 0.04 mag and BV photometry of
976 stars were used to estimate a distance modulus of (m$-$M)$_0$ = 12.7
$\pm$0.2 mag, corresponding to a distance of 3470$^{+335}_{-305}$ pc. We
estimated 10 -- 16 Myr as the turn-off age for the upper main sequence of the
cluster using isochrones and synthetic colour magnitude diagrams. We identified
two B type stars with H$_\alpha$ in emission and located on the MS using
slit-less spectra. A higher resolution spectrum of the brighter Be star
indicated the presence of a number of emission lines, with some lines showing
the signature of gas infall. This star was found to be located in the region of
Herbig Ae/Be stars in the (J$-$H) vs (H$-$K) colour-colour diagram. Thus, we
identify this star as a Herbig Be star. On the other hand, 54 stars were found
to show near infrared excess, of which 17 were found to be located in the
region of Herbig Ae/Be stars and 18 stars were found to be located in the
region of Be stars in the NIR colour-colour diagram. Thus NGC 146 is a young
cluster with a large number of intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars. The
turn-on age of the cluster is found to be $\sim$ 3 Myr. Though NGC 146 shows an
older turn off, the bulk of stars in this cluster seems to belong to the
younger population of 3 Myr.",2005-05-16T04:36:07Z
"A Radio Counterpart for the Unidentified TeV Source HESS J1813-178: The
  Radio-Gamma-Ray Connection","We discovered independently the shell-type supernova remnant G12.82-0.02,
recently reported by Brogan et al. (2005), which is coincident with the
unidentified TeV gamma-ray source revealed in the HESS survey of the Galactic
plane. Estimating the ambient starlight at the location of this source from the
integrated Ly alpha luminosity of the nearby H II region W33, we conclude that
inverse Compton emission is a viable explanation for the observed TeV emission.
Examining remnants in the survey of Aharonian et al. (2005a) including those
detected above 200 Gev and those not detected, we find a strikingly large range
of more than three orders of magnitude in the radio to TeV flux ratios. We
briefly explore the possible explanations of this range and the implications
for the TeV emission mechanism.",2005-05-18T20:17:53Z
"On the Estimation of Solar Energetic Particle Injection Timing from
  Onset Times near Earth","We examine the accuracy of a common technique for estimating the start time
of solar energetic particle injection based on a linear fit to the observed
onset time versus 1/(particle velocity). This is based on a concept that the
first arriving particles move directly along the magnetic field with no
scattering. We check this by performing numerical simulations of the transport
of solar protons between 2 and 2000 MeV from the Sun to the Earth, for several
assumptions regarding interplanetary scattering and the duration of particle
injection, and analyzing the results using the inverse velocity fit. We find
that in most cases, the onset times align close to a straight line as a
function of inverse velocity. Despite this, the estimated injection time can be
in error by several minutes. Also, the estimated path length can deviate
greatly from the actual path length along the interplanetary magnetic field.
The major difference between the estimated and actual path lengths implies that
the first arriving particles cannot be viewed as moving directly along the
interplanetary magnetic field.",2005-03-18T04:11:28Z
"Early-time Spitzer observations of the type II-Plateau supernova, 2004dj","We present mid-infrared observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope of the
nearby type II-P supernova, SN 2004dj, at epochs of 89 to 129 days. We have
obtained the first mid-IR spectra of any supernova apart from SN 1987A. A
prominent [NiII] 6.64 micron line is observed, from which we deduce that the
mass of stable nickel must be at least 2.2e10(-4) Msun. We also observe the red
wing of the CO-fundamental band. We relate our findings to possible progenitors
and favour an evolved star, most likely a red supergiant, with a probable
initial mass between ~10 and 15 Msun.",2005-06-17T10:31:08Z
"The XMM-Newton Detection of Diffuse Inverse Compton X-rays from Lobes of
  the FR-II Radio Galaxy 3C98","The XMM-Newton observation of the nearby FR-II radio galaxy 3C 98 is
reported. In two exposures on the target, faint diffuse X-ray emission
associated with the radio lobes was significantly detected, together with a
bright X-ray active nucleus, of which the 2 -- 10 keV intrinsic luminosity is
(4 -- 8) \times 10^{42} erg s-1. The EPIC spectra of the northern and southern
lobes are reproduced by a single power law model modified by the Galactic
absorption, with a photon index of 2.2-0.5+0.6 and 1.7-0.6+0.7 respectively.
These indices are consistent with that of the radio synchrotron spectrum, 1.73
+- 0.01 The luminosity of the northern and southern lobes are measured to be
8.3-2.6+3.3 \times 10^{40} erg s-1 and 9.2-4.3+5.7 \times 10^{40} erg s-1,
respectively, in the 0.7 -- 7 keV range. The diffuse X-ray emission is
interpreted as an inverse-Compton emission, produced when the
synchrotron-emitting energetic electrons in the lobes scatter off the cosmic
microwave background photons. The magnetic field in the lobes is calculated to
be about 1.7 \mu G, which is about 2.5 times lower than the value estimated
under the minimum energy condition. The energy density of the electrons is
inferred to exceed that in the magnetic fields by a factor of 40 -- 50.",2005-06-28T06:00:13Z
"Structural properties of dwarf elliptical galaxies and the connection
  with (ordinary) elliptical galaxies","This article reviews the popular reasons for the belief that dwarf elliptical
galaxies and (ordinary) elliptical galaxies are distinct and separate species.
They include: light-profile shape (or similarly image concentration); the
magnitude-central surface brightness diagram; the magnitude-effective surface
brightness diagram (or similarly the magnitude-effective radius diagram); and
the Fundamental Plane. It is shown how a continuous trend between luminosity
and a) light-profile shape, and b) central surface brightness (until the onest
of core formation at M_B ~ -20.5 mag, results in a unification of the dwarf
elliptical and (ordinary) elliptical galaxies. Neither the above four reasons,
nor the luminosity function (at least in the Virgo cluster) provide evidence
for a division at M_B = -18 mag between the dwarf elliptical and (ordinary)
elliptical galaxies. Instead, they appear to be continuous extensions of each
other.",2005-05-20T08:41:14Z
Kuiper Binary Object Formation,"It has been observed that binary Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) exist contrary to
theoretical expectations. Their creation presents problems to most current
models. However, the inclusion of a third body (for example, one of the outer
planets) may provide the conditions necessary for the formation of these
objects. The presence of a third massive body not only helps to clear the
primordial Kuiper Belt but can also result in long lived binary Kuiper belt
objects. The gravitational interaction between the KBOs and the third body
causes one of four effects; scattering into the Oort cloud, collisions with the
growing protoplanets, formation of binary pairs, or creation of a single Kuiper
belt object. Additionally, the initial location of the progenitors of the
Kuiper belt objects also has a significant effect on binary formation.",2005-07-06T20:27:22Z
High energy astrophysical processes,"We briefly review the high energy astrophysical processes that are related to
the production of high energy $\gamma$-ray and neutrino signals and are likely
to be important for the energy loss of high and ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.
We also give examples for neutrino fluxes generated by different astrophysical
objects and describe the cosmological link provided by cosmogenic neutrinos.",2005-04-18T20:27:45Z
"State transition and flaring activity of IGR J17464-3213/H1743-322 with
  SPI/INTEGRAL telescope","IGR J17464-3213, already known as the HEAO-1 transient source H1743-322, has
been detected during a state transition by the SPI/INTEGRAL telescope. We
describe the spectral evolution and flaring activity of IGR
J17464-3213/H1743-322 from 2003 March 21 to 2003 April 22. During the first
part, the source followed a continuous spectral softening, with the peak of the
spectral energy distribution shifting from 100 keV down to a few keV. However
the thermal disk and the hard X-ray components had a similar intensity,
indicating that the source was in an intermediate state throughout our
observations and evolving toward the soft state. In the second part of our
observations, the ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL light curve showed a strong flaring
activity. Two flare events lasting about 1 day each have been detected with SPI
and are probably due to instabilities in the accretion disk associated with the
state transition. During these flares, the low (1.5-12 keV) and high (20-200
keV) energy fluxes monitored with ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL, are correlated and
the spectral shape (above 20 keV) remains unchanged while the luminosity
increases by a factor greater than 2.",2005-05-19T15:05:38Z
"Is the Bursting Radio-source GCRT J1745-3009 a Double Neutron Star
  Binary ?","GCRT J1745-3009 is a peculiar transient radio-source in the direction of the
Galactic Center. It was observed to emit a series of ~ 1 Jy bursts at 0.33 GHz,
with typical duration ~ 10 min and at apparently regular intervals of ~ 77 min.
If the source is indeed at the distance of the Galactic Center as it seems
likely, we show that its observational properties are compatible with those
expected from a double neutron star binary, similar to the double pulsar system
J0737-3039. In the picture we propose the (coherent) radio emission comes from
the shock originating in the interaction of the wind of the more energetic
pulsar with the magnetosphere of the companion. The observed modulation of the
radio signal is the consequence of an eccentric orbit, along which the
separation between the two stars varies. This cyclically drives the shock
inside the light cylinder radius of the less energetic pulsar.",2005-06-09T12:36:14Z
Two-dimensional Kinematics of a Bar and Central Disk in NGC5448,"We analyse SAURON kinematic maps of the inner kpc of the early-type (Sa)
barred spiral galaxy NGC 5448. The observed morphology and kinematics of the
emission-line gas is patchy and perturbed, indicating clear departures from
circular motion. The kinematics of the stars is more regular, and displays a
small inner disk-like system embedded in a large-scale rotating structure. We
focus on the [OIII] gas, and use a harmonic decomposition formalism to analyse
the gas velocity field. The higher-order harmonic terms and the main kinematic
features of the observed data are consistent with an analytically constructed
simple bar model, which is derived using linear theory. Our study illustrates
how the harmonic decomposition formalism can be used as a powerful tool to
quantify non-circular motions in observed gas velocity fields.",2005-08-04T13:34:45Z
The pressure distribution in thermally bistable turbulent flows,"We present a systematic numerical study of the effect of turbulent velocity
fluctuations on the thermal pressure distribution in thermally bistable flows.
The simulations employ a random turbulent driving generated in Fourier space
rather than star-like heating. The turbulent fluctuations are characterized by
their rms Mach number M and the energy injection wavenumber, k_for. Our results
are consistent with the picture that as either of these parameters is
increased, the local ratio of turbulent crossing time to cooling time
decreases, causing transient structures in which the effective behavior is
intermediate between the thermal-equilibrium and adiabatic regimes. As a
result, the effective polytropic exponent gamma_ef ranges between ~0.2 to ~1.1.
The fraction of high-density zones with P>10^4 Kcm^-3 increases from roughly
0.1% at k_for=2 and M=0.5 to roughly 70% for k_for=16 and M=1.25. A preliminary
comparison with the pressure measurements of Jenkins (2004) favors our case
with M=0.5 and k_for=2. In all cases, the dynamic range of the pressure summed
over the entire density range, typically spans 3-4 orders of magnitude. The
total pressure histogram widens as the Mach number is increased, and develops
near-power-law tails at high (resp.low) pressures when gamma_ef<~ 0.5 (resp.
gamma_ef>~ 1), which occurs at k_for=2 (resp.k_for=16) in our simulations. The
opposite side of the pressure histogram decays rapidly, in an approx. lognormal
form. Our results show that turbulent advection alone can generate large
pressure scatters, with power-law high-P tails for large-scale driving, and
provide validation for approaches attempting to derive the shape of the
pressure histogram through a change of variable from the known form of the
density histogram, such as that performed by MacLow et al.(2004).",2005-04-20T16:27:26Z
"RR Lyrae stars: Kinematics, orbits and z-distribution","RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way are good tracers to study the kinematic
behaviour and spatial distribution of older stellar populations. A recently
established well documented sample of 217 RR Lyr stars with V<12.5 mag, has
been used to reinvestigate these structural parameters. The kinematic
parameters allowed to calculate the orbits of the stars. Nearly 1/3 of the
stars of our sample has orbits staying near the Milky Way plane. Of the 217
stars, 163 have halo-like orbits fulfilling one of the following criteria:
Theta < 100 km/s, orbit eccentricity >0.4, and normalized maximum orbital
z-distance >0.45. Of these stars roughly half have retrograde orbits. The
z-distance probability distribution of this sample shows scale heights of 1.3
+-0.1 kpc for the disk component and 4.6 +-0.3 kpc for the halo component. With
our orbit statistics method we found a (vertical) spatial distribution which,
out to z=20 kpc, is similar to that found with other methods. This distribution
is also compatible with the ones found for blue (HBA and sdB) halo stars. The
circular velocity Theta, the orbit eccentricity, orbit z-extent and [Fe/H] are
employed to look for possible correlations. If any, it is that the metal poor
stars with [Fe/H] <1.0 have a wide symmetric distribution about Theta=0. We
conclude that the Milky Way possesses a halo component of old and metal poor
stars with a scale height of 4-5 kpc having random orbits. The presence in our
sample of a few metal poor stars (thus part of the halo population) with thin
disk-like orbits is statistically not surprising. The midplane density ratio of
halo to disk stars is found to be 0.16, a value very dependent on proper sample
statistics. Keywords: astrometry -- Stars: kinematics -- Stars: variables --

Dynamical One-Armed Spiral Instability in Differentially Rotating Stars,"We investigate the dynamical one-armed spiral instability in differentially
rotating stars with both eigenmode analysis and hydrodynamic simulations in
Newtonian gravity. We find that the one-armed spiral mode is generated around
the corotation radius of the star, and the distribution of angular momentum
shifts inwards the corotation radius during the growth of one-armed spiral
mode. We also find by investigating the distribution of the canonical angular
momentum density that the low T/|W| dynamical instability for both m=1 and m=2
mode, where T is the rotational kinetic energy and W is the gravitational
potential energy, is generated around the corotation point. Finally, we discuss
the feature of gravitational waves generated from these modes.",2005-03-31T21:22:53Z
Dark Matter from Early Decays,"Two leading dark matter candidates from supersymmetry and other theories of
physics beyond the standard model are WIMPs and weak scale gravitinos. If the
lightest stable particle is a gravitino, then a WIMP will decay into it with a
natural lifetime of order a month ~ M_{pl}^2/M_{weak}^3. We show that if the
bulk of dark matter today came from decays of neutral particles with lifetimes
of order a year or smaller, then it could lead to a reduction in the amount of
small scale substructure, less concentrated halos and constant density cores in
the smallest mass halos. Such beneficial effects may therefore be realized
naturally, as discussed by Cembranos, Feng, Rajaraman, and Takayama, in the
case of supersymmetry.",2005-07-13T18:58:02Z
Orbital Parameters of the Microquasar LSI +61 303,"New optical spectroscopy of the HMXB microquasar LSI +61 303 is presented.
Eccentric orbital fits to our radial velocity measurements yield updated
orbital parameters in good agreement with previous work. Our orbital solution
indicates that the periastron passage occurs at radio phase 0.23 and the
X-ray/radio outbursts are triggered 2.5--4 days after the compact star passage.
The spectrum of the optical star is consistent with a B0 V spectral type and
contributes ~65 percent of the total light, the remaining due to emission by a
circumstellar disc. We also measure the projected rotational velocity to be v
sin i = 113 km/s.",2005-04-14T16:20:26Z
Search for H3+ in HD141569A,"A search for H3+ line emission, reported to have been detected toward the
young star HD 141569A and possibly originating in a clump of planet-forming gas
orbiting the star, has yielded negative results. Observations made at the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and at the Subaru Telescope during 2001-2005
covered 11 major transitions of H3+ from 3.42 to 3.99 um. No H3+ emission lines
were detected; one marginal detection at 3.9855 um in June 2002 was not
confirmed in later spectra. The upper limits to the line strengths are
significantly lower than the previously reported detections. Supplemental
slit-scanning spectroscopy using adaptive optics was performed within 0.38 of
HD 141569A to search for extended emission from H3+, but no emission was
detected. We compare our upper limit to the luminosity in H3+ from HD 141569A
with that possible from a gas giant protoplanet and also from a jovian mass
exoplanet in close orbit about its central star.",2005-04-22T22:42:34Z
"Internal Alignment of the Halos of Disk Galaxies in Cosmological
  Hydrodynamic Simulations","Seven cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of disk galaxy formation are
analyzed to determine the alignment of the disk within the dark matter halo and
the internal structure of the halo. We find that the orientation of the outer
halo, beyond ~0.1 r_vir, is unaffected by the presence of the disk. In
contrast, the inner halo is aligned such that the halo minor axis aligns with
the disk axis. The relative orientation of these two regions of the halo are
uncorrelated. The alignment of the disk and inner halo appears to take place
simultaneously through their joint evolution. The disconnect between these two
regions of the halo should be taken into account when modelling tidal streams
in the halos of disk galaxies and when calculating intrinsic alignments of disk
galaxies based on the properties of dark matter halos.",2005-05-26T00:43:40Z
"Rest-frame optical and far-infrared observations of extremely bright
  Lyman-break galaxy candidates at z ~ 2.5","We have investigated the rest-frame optical and far-infrared properties of a
sample of extremely bright candidate Lyman-break galaxies (LBG) identified in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Their high ultraviolet luminosities and lack of
strong ultraviolet emission lines are suggestive of massive starbursts,
although it is possible that they are more typical luminosity LBGs which have
been highly magnified by strong gravitational lensing. Alternatively, they may
be an unusual class of weak-lined quasars. If the ultraviolet and submillimetre
properties of these objects mirror those of less luminous, starburst LBGs, then
they should have detectable rest-frame far-infrared emission. However, our
submm photometry fails to detect such emission, indicating that these systems
are not merely scaled-up (either intrinsically or as a result of lensing)
examples of typical LBGs. In addition we have searched for the morphological
signatures of strong lensing, using high-resolution, near-infrared imaging, but
we find none. Instead, near-infrared spectroscopy reveals that these systems
are, in fact, a rare class of broad absorption-line (BAL) quasars.",2005-06-21T13:02:06Z
"A new estimate of the Galactic interstellar radiation field between 0.1
  microns and 1000 microns","Cosmic-ray electrons and positrons propagating in the Galaxy produce diffuse
gamma-rays via the inverse Compton (IC) process. The low energy target photon
populations with which the cosmic-rays interact during propagation are produced
by stars, this stellar light being reprocessed by Galactic dust. Detailed
modelling of the Galactic stellar distribution, dust distribution, and
treatment of the absorption and scattering of light is therefore required to
obtain accurate models for the low energy Galactic photon distribution and
spectrum. Using a realistic Galactic stellar distribution model, and dust
distribution, we calculate the diffuse radiation field from stars in the Galaxy
(the `optical' radiation field), including absorption and scattering. Using a
dust heating code, we self-consistently calculate the infra-red radiation field
for the same dust model used for the optical calculation; both transient and
equilibrium heating are included. We present the calculated radiation field
spectra and distributions, and will use these to calculate the expected
Galactic diffuse IC gamma-ray spectrum.",2005-07-06T04:31:05Z
"Eclipsing binaries in the Galactic Bulge: candidates for distance
  estimates","The 222~000 I-band light curves of variable stars detected by the OGLE-II
survey in the direction of the Galactic Bulge have been searched for eclipsing
binaries (EBs). A previously developed code to analyze lightcurve shapes and
identify long period variables (LPVs) has been adapted to identify EBs. The
parameters in the modified code have been optimised to recover a list of about
140 detached EBs in the Small Magellanic Cloud previously identified in the
literature as particularly well suited for distance estimates (and wich have
periods \more 0.85 days). The power of the code is demonstrated by identifying
16 and 178 previously uncatalogued EBs in the SMC and LMC, respectively. Among
the 222~000 variable stars in the direction of the Galactic Bulge 3053 EBs have
been identified. Periods and phased lightcurves are presented.",2005-05-06T14:08:32Z
"Sgr A East as a possible high energy neutron factory in the Galactic
  Centre","Sgr A East is a supernova remnant located within few parsecs from the
Galactic Centre (GC). There are good reasons to believe that this object is the
source of the gamma-ray excess detected by HESS in the direction of the GC
meaning that Sgr A East is likely to be an efficient Cosmic Ray accelerator.
Some observations suggest that strong magnetic fields may be present in that
region allowing the acceleration of composite nuclei in Sgr A East beyond the
EeV. We show that, if this is case, EeV neutrons should be effectively produced
by the photo-disintegration of Ultra High Energy nuclei onto the IR photon
background (with temperature $\sim 40$ K) in which Sgr A East is embedded.
  Neutrons with such an energy can reach the Earth before decaying and may be
detectable under the form of a CR point-like excess in the direction of the GC.
  We determine the expected energy spectrum and the amplitude of this signal
showing that it may be measurable by the AUGER observatory.",2005-04-14T12:56:35Z
Time-Variable Complex Metal Absorption Lines in the Quasar HS1603+3820,"We present a new spectrum of the quasar HS1603+3820 taken 1.28 years (0.36
years in the quasar rest frame) after a previous observation with Subaru+HDS.
The new spectrum enables us to search for time variability as an identifier of
intrinsic narrow absorption lines (NALs). This quasar shows a rich complex of C
IV NALs within 60,000 km/s of the emission redshift. Based on covering factor
analysis, Misawa et al. found that the C IV NAL system at z_abs= 2.42--2.45
(System A, at a shift velocity of v_sh = 8,300--10,600 km/s relative to the
quasar) was intrinsic to the quasar. With our new spectrum, we perform time
variability analysis as well as covering factor analysis to separate intrinsic
NALs from intervening NALs for 8 C IV systems. Only System A, which was
identified as an intrinsic system in the earlier paper by Misawa et al., shows
a strong variation in line strength (W_obs ~ 10.4A -> 19.1A). We speculate that
a broad absorption line (BAL) could be forming in this quasar. We illustrate
the plausibility of this suggestion with the help of a simulation. Under the
assumption that a change of ionization state causes the variability, a lower
limit can be placed on the electron density (n_e > 3x10^4 cm^-3) and an upper
limit on the distance from the continuum source (r < 6 kpc). On the other hand,
if the motion of clumpy gas causes the variability (a more likely scenario),
the crossing velocity and the distance from the continuum source are estimated
to be v_cross > 8,000 km/s and r < 3 pc. In this case, the absorber does not
intercept any flux from the broad emission line region, but only flux from the
UV continuum source. If we adopt the dynamical model of Murray et al., we can
obtain a much more strict constraint on the distance of the gas parcel from the
continuum source, r < 0.2 pc.",2005-04-29T14:29:12Z
Detailed Chemical Abundances of Extragalactic Globular Clusters,"We outline a method to measure the detailed chemical composition of
extragalactic (unresolved) globular clusters (GCs) from echelle spectra of
their integrated light. Our goal is to use this method to measure abundance
patterns of GCs in distant spiral and elliptical galaxies to constrain their
formation histories. To develop this technique we have obtained a ``training
set'' of integrated-light spectra of resolved GCs in the Milky Way and LMC by
scanning across the clusters during exposures. Our training set also include
spectra of individual stars in those GCs from which abundances can be obtained
in the normal way to provide a check on our integrated-light results. We
present here the preliminary integrated-light analysis of one GC in our
training set, NGC 104 (47 Tuc), and outline some of the techniques utilized and
problems encountered in that analysis.",2005-07-01T21:07:15Z
"Astrophysical Production of Microscopic Black Holes in a Low
  Planck-scale World","In the framework of brane-world models lowering the Planck scale to the TeV
range, it has recently been pointed out that small black holes could be formed
at particle colliders or by neutrinos interactions in the atmosphere. This
article aims at reviewing other places and epochs where microscopic black holes
could be formed : the interstellar medium and the early Universe. The related
decay channels and the propagation of the emitted particles are studied to
conclude that, in spite of the large creation rate for such black holes, the
amount of produced particles do not conflict with experimental data. This
shows, from the astronomical viewpoint, that models with large extra dimensions
making the gravity scale much lower are compatible with observations.",2005-05-20T13:18:34Z
The Cosmological History of Accretion onto Supermassive Black Holes,"It is argued that supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies most
likely have grown coevally with their host dark matter halos. A calculation
based on Press-Schechter within this framework shows that the mean rate of
accretion of matter onto such black holes varies from a value about 0.003 of
the Eddington rate at the present epoch to a value around 0.08 at redshift 3.
The bulk of AGN evolution may be explained as a reflection of the diminishing
rate of accretion of material onto galaxies. The result is almost independent
of mass of host dark matter halo and is only weakly dependent on the values of
cosmological parameters. At high redshifts, z greater than about 5, black holes
in galaxies would have been accreting close to the Eddington limit, which is
likely to lead to galactic outflows being ubiquitous at those epochs.",2005-06-24T12:50:41Z
"Confirmation of two extended objects along the line of sight to
  PKS1830-211 with ESO-VLT adaptive optics imaging","We report on new high-resolution near-infrared images of the gravitationally
lensed radio source PKS1830-211, a quasar at z=2.507. These adaptive optics
observations, taken with the Very Large Telescope (VLT), are further improved
through image deconvolution. They confirm the presence of a second object along
the line of sight to the quasar, in addition to the previously known spiral
galaxy. This additional object is clearly extended in our images. However, its
faint luminosity does not allow to infer any photometric redshift. If this
galaxy is located in the foreground of PKS1830-211, it complicates the modeling
of this system and decreases the interest in using PKS1830-211 as a means to
determine H0 via the time delay between the two lensed images of the quasar.",2005-06-27T12:45:13Z
Chandra Observations of the Interacting Galaxies NGC 3395/3396 (Arp 270),"In this paper we present the results of a 20 ks high resolution Chandra X-ray
observation of the peculiar galaxy pair NGC 3395/3396, a system at a very early
stage of merging, and less evolved than the famous Antennae and Mice merging
systems. Previously unpublished ROSAT HRI data are also presented. The point
source population and the hot diffuse gas in this system are investigated, and
compared with other merging galaxy pairs. 16 X-ray point sources are detected
in Arp 270, 7 of which are classified as ULXs (Lx > 10^39 erg/s). From spectral
fits and the age of the system it seems likely that these are predominantly
high mass X-ray binaries. The diffuse gas emits at a global temperature of ~0.5
keV, consistent with temperatures observed in other interacting systems, and we
see no evidence of the starburst-driven hot gaseous outflows seen in more
evolved systems such as The Mice and The Antennae. It is likely that these
features are absent from Arp 270 as the gas has had insufficient time to break
out of the galaxy disks. 32% of the luminosity of Arp 270 arises from the
diffuse gas in the system, this is low when compared to later stage merging
systems and gives further credence that this is an early stage merger.
Comparing the ULX population of Arp 270 to other merging systems, we derive a
relationship between the star formation rate of the system, indicated by Lfir,
and the number (N(ULX)) and luminosity (Lulx) of its ULX population. We find
Nulx proportional to Lfir^0.18 and Lulx proportional to Lfir^0.54. These
relationships, coupled with the relation of the point source X-ray luminosity
(Lxp) to Lk and Lfir+uv (Colbert et al. 2003), indicate that the ULX sources in
an interacting system have contributions from both the old and young stellar
populations.",2005-04-12T21:43:08Z
Inflationary spectra and violations of Bell inequalities,"In spite of the macroscopic character of the primordial fluctuations, the
standard inflationary distribution (that obtained using linear mode equations)
exhibits inherently quantum properties, that is, properties which cannot be
mimicked by any stochastic distribution. This is demonstrated by a Gedanken
experiment for which certain Bell inequalities are violated. These violations
are {\it in principle} measurable because, unlike for Hawking radiation from
black holes, in inflationary cosmology we can have access to both members of
correlated pairs of modes delivered in the same state. We then compute the
effect of decoherence and show that the violations persist provided the
decoherence level (and thus the entropy) lies below a certain non-vanishing
threshold. Moreover, there exists a higher threshold above which no violation
of any Bell inequality can occur. In this regime, the distributions are
``separable'' and can be interpreted as stochastic ensembles of fluctuations.
Unfortunately, the precision which is required to have access to the quantum
properties is so high that, {\it in practice}, an observational verification
seems excluded.",2005-05-18T13:49:01Z
Observations of Selected AGN with H.E.S.S,"A sample of selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) was observed in 2003 and
2004 with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), an array of imaging
atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia. The redshifts of these candidate
very-high-energy (VHE, >100 GeV) gamma-ray emitters range from z=0.00183 to
z=0.333. Significant detections were already reported for some of these
objects, such as PKS 2155-304 and Markarian 421. Marginal evidence (3.1 sigma)
for a signal is found from large-zenith-angle observations of Markarian 501,
corresponding to an integral flux of I(>1.65 TeV) = (1.5 +/- 0.6 (stat) +/- 0.3
(syst)) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} or ~15% of the Crab Nebula flux. Integral
flux upper limits for 19 other AGN, based on exposures of ~1 to ~8 hrs live
time, and with average energy thresholds between 160 GeV and 610 GeV, range
from 0.4% to 5.1% of the Crab Nebula flux. All the upper limits are the most
constraining ever reported for these objects.",2005-07-08T13:01:22Z
Cluster scaling and its redshift evolution from XMM-Newton,"We put together the results of XMM-Newton observations of a number of
representative group and cluster samples at low and high redshifts. These
results confirm the entropy ramp as an explanation of the observed scaling
relations. We observe a mild evolution in the entropy of clusters. The observed
degree of evolution is consistent with expectations of the shock heating at a
fixed overdensity (500) with respect to the critical density in LCDM. The study
of the evolution in the pressure scaling imposes strong requirements in the
definition of the average temperature of the cluster. The scaling temperature
should be consistent to better than the 10% level. Once such a consistency is
achieved, no additional evolution in the pressure has been detected in addition
to the prediction of the shock heating in the LCDM Universe.",2005-05-19T20:00:00Z
"Non-Gaussianity of one-point distribution functions in extended
  Lagrangian perturbation theory","We study the one-point probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the
peculiar velocity and the density fluctuation in a cosmological fluid. Within
the perturbative approach to the structure formation scenario, the effect of
``pressure'' has recently been an area of research interest. The velocity
dispersion of the cosmological fluid creates effective ``pressure'' or
viscosity terms. From this viewpoint, because the pressure reflects a nonlinear
effect of the motion of the fluid, the pressure model would include nonlinear
effects. Here we analyze the Lagrangian linear perturbation PDFs for both the
Zel'dovich approximation and the pressure model. We find that the PDFs of the
peculiar velocity remain Gaussian, even if we consider the pressure. For the
PDFs of the density fluctuation, the occurrence of non-Gaussianity depends on
the ``equation of state'' for the fluid. Therefore we distinguish the
``equation of state'' using the PDFs.",2005-04-08T15:45:34Z
Initial Conditions for Massive Star Birth -- Infrared Dark Clouds,"We summarize the properties of Infrared Dark Clouds, massive, dense, and cool
aggregations of interstellar gas and dust that are found througout the Galaxy
in projection against the strong mid-infrared background. We describe their
distribution and give an overview of their physical properties and chemistry.
These objects appear to be the progenitors of high-mass stars and star
clusters, but seem to be largely devoid of star formation, which however is
taking place in localized spots.",2005-08-01T10:14:39Z
"Lepton asymmetry and primordial nucleosynthesis in the era of precision
  cosmology","We calculate and display the primordial light-element abundances as a
function of a neutrino degeneracy parameter \xi common to all flavors. It is
the only unknown parameter characterizing the thermal medium at the primordial
nucleosynthesis epoch. The observed primordial helium abundance Y_p is the most
sensitive cosmic ``leptometer.'' Adopting the conservative Y_p error analysis
of Olive and Skillman implies -0.04 \alt \xi \alt 0.07 whereas the errors
stated by Izotov and Thuan imply \xi=0.0245+-0.0092 (1 sigma). Improved
determinations of the baryon abundance have no significant impact on this
situation. A determination of Y_p that reliably distinguishes between a
vanishing or nonvanishing \xi is a crucial test of the cosmological standard
assumption that sphaleron effects equilibrate the cosmic lepton and baryon
asymmetries.",2005-06-08T08:39:57Z
Metal Abundances in the ICM as a Diagnostics of the Cluster History,"Galaxy clusters with a dense cooling core exhibit a central increase in the
metallicity of the intracluster medium. Recent XMM-Newton studies with detailed
results on the relative abundances of several heavy elements show that the high
central abundances are mostly due to the contribution from supernovae type Ia.
The dominant source is the stellar population of the central cluster galaxy.
With this identification of the origin of heavy elements and the observed rates
of SN Ia in elliptical galaxies, the central abundance peak can be used as a
diagnostic for the history of the cluster core region. We find for four nearby
cooling core clusters that the enrichment times for the central peaks are
larger than 6 - 10 Gyrs even for a higher SN Ia rate in the past. This points
to an old age and a relatively quiet history of these cluster core regions. A
detailed analysis of the element abundance ratios provides evidence that the SN
Ia yields in the central cluster galaxies are more rich in intermediate mass
elements, like Si and S, compared to the SN Ia models used to explain the heavy
element enrichment in our Galaxy.",2005-07-19T09:08:33Z
"Very compact radio emission from high-mass protostars. II. Dust disks
  and ionized accretion flows","This paper reports 43 GHz imaging of the high-mass protostars W33A, AFGL 2591
and NGC 7538 IRS9 at 0.04'' and 0.6'' resolution. In each case, weak (~mJy),
compact (~100 AU) emission is detected, which has an elongated shape (axis
ratio ~3). For AFGL 2591 and NGC 7538 IRS9, the emission is single-peaked,
while for the highest luminosity source, W33A, a `mini-cluster' of three
sources is detected. The derived sizes, flux densities, and broad-band radio
spectra of the sources support recent models where the initial expansion of HII
regions around very young O-type stars is prevented by stellar gravity. In
these models, accretion flows onto high-mass stars originate in large-scale
molecular envelopes and become ionized close to the star. These models
reproduce our observations of ionized gas as well as the structure of the
molecular envelopes of these sources on 10^3--10^4 AU scales derived previously
from single-dish submillimeter continuum and line mapping. For AFGL 2591, the
43 GHz flux density is also consistent with dust emission from a disk seen in
near-infrared `speckle' images. However, the alignment of the 43 GHz emission
with the large-scale molecular outflow argues against an origin in a disk for
AFGL 2591 and NGC 7538 IRS9. In contrast, the outflow from W33A does not appear
to be collimated. Together with previously presented case studies of W3 IRS5
and AFGL 2136, our results indicate that the formation of stars and stellar
clusters with luminosities up to ~10^5 L0 proceeds through accretion and
produces collimated outflows as in the solar-type case, with the `additional
feature' that the accretion flow becomes ionized close to the star. Above ~10^5
L0, clusters of HII regions appear, and outflows are no longer collimated,
possibly as the result of mergers of protostars or pre-stellar cores.",2005-04-01T14:53:31Z
H2CO and CH3OH abundances in the envelopes around low-mass protostars,"This paper presents the third in a series of single-dish studies of molecular
abundances in the envelopes around a large sample of 18 low-mass pre- and
protostellar objects. It focuses on typical grain mantle products and organic
molecules, including H2CO, CH3OH and CH3CN. With a few exceptions, all H2CO
lines can be fit by constant abundances of 7e(-11)-8e(-9) throughout the
envelopes if ortho- and para lines are considered independently. The current
observational dataset does not require a large H2CO abundance enhancement in
the inner warm regions, but this can also not be ruled out. Through comparison
of the H2CO abundances of the entire sample, the H2CO ortho-para ratio is
constrained to be 1.6+/-0.3 consistent with thermalization on grains at
temperatures of 10-15 K. The H2CO abundances can be related to the empirical
chemical network established on the basis of our previously reported survey of
other species and is found to be closely correlated with that of the
nitrogen-bearing molecules. These correlations reflect the freeze-out of
molecules at low temperatures and high densities. An improved fit to the data
is obtained with a `drop' abundance structure in which the abundance decrease
when the temperature is lower than the evaporation temperature and the density
high enough so that the timescale for depletion is less than the lifetime of
the core. The derived abundance structures for CH3OH are consistent with a
scenario where CH3OH probes the action of compact outflows on the envelopes,
which is further supported by comparison to high frequency, high excitation CS
J=10-9 and HDO line profiles. The extent to which the outflow dominates the
abundance enhancements compared with the passively heated inner envelope
depends on the filling factors of the two components in the observing beam.",2005-03-28T21:25:09Z
"UVBLUE: a new high-resolution theoretical library of ultraviolet stellar
  spectra","We present an extended ultraviolet-blue (850-4700 AA) library of theoretical
stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) computed at high resolution, R=
50,000. The UVBLUE grid, as we named the library, is based on LTE calculations
carried out with ATLAS9 and SYNTHE codes developed by R. L. Kurucz and consists
of nearly 1800 entries that cover a large volume of the parameter space. It
spans a range in effective temperature from 3000 to 50,000 K, the surface
gravity ranges from log g= 0.0 to 5.0 with a step of 0.5 dex, while seven
chemical compositions are considered: [Fe/H]= -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, +0.0,
+0.3 and +0.5 dex. For its coverage across the H-R diagram, this library is the
most comprehensive one ever computed at high resolution in the short-wavelength
spectral range, and useful application can be foreseen both for the study of
single stars and in population synthesis models of galaxies and other stellar
systems.",2005-04-13T20:14:40Z
Low Power Compact Radio Galaxies at High Angular Resolution,"We present sub-arcsecond resolution multi-frequency (8 and 22 GHz)
  VLA images of five low power compact (LPC) radio sources, and phase
referenced VLBA images at 1.6 GHz of their nuclear regions. At the VLA
resolution we resolve the structure and identify component positions and flux
densities. The phase referenced VLBA data at 1.6 GHz reveals flat-spectrum,
compact cores (down to a few milliJansky) in four of the five sources. The
absolute astrometry provided by the phase referencing allows us to identify the
center of activity on the VLA images. Moreover, these data reveal rich
structures, including two-sided jets and secondary components. On the basis of
the arcsecond scale structures and of the nuclear properties, we rule out the
presence of strong relativistic effects in our LPCs, which must be
intrinsically small (deprojected linear sizes <~ 10 kpc). Fits of continuous
injection models reveal break frequencies in the GHz domain, and ages in the
range 10^5-10^7 yrs. In LPCs, the outermost edge may be advancing more slowly
than in more powerful sources or could even be stationary; some LPCs might also
have ceased their activity. In general, the properties of LPCs can be related
to a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: youth, frustration, low
kinematic power jets, and short-lived activity in the radio.",2005-06-21T14:33:00Z
"Can Remote Observing be Good Observing? Reflections on Procrustes and
  Antaeus","Remote observing seeks to simulate the presence of the astronomer at the
telescope. While this is useful, and necessary in some circumstances,
simulation is not reality. The drive to abstract the astronomer from the
instrument can have unpleasant consequences, some of which are prefigured in
the ancient tales of Procrustes and Antaeus. This article, written in 1992 for
a conference proceedings on remote observing, is reprinted here with only
slight editorial changes and the addition of a short Afterword. I consider some
of the human factors involved in remote observing, and suggest that our aim be
to enhance rather than supplant the astronomer at the telescope.",2005-07-06T17:37:28Z
Smoothing spline primordial power spectrum reconstruction,"We reconstruct the shape of the primordial power spectrum (PPS) using a
smoothing spline. Our adapted smoothing spline technique provides a
complementary method to existing efforts to search for smooth features in the
PPS, such as a running spectral index. With this technique we find no
significant indication with WMAP first-year data that the PPS deviates from
Harrison-Zeldovich and no evidence for loss of power on large scales. We also
examine the effect on the cosmological parameters of the additional PPS
freedom. Smooth variations in the PPS are not significantly degenerate with
other cosmological parameters, but the spline reconstruction greatly increases
the errors on the optical depth and baryon fraction.",2005-06-28T20:59:55Z
"Gamma-Ray Bursts and the Earth: Exploration of Atmospheric, Biological,
  Climatic and Biogeochemical Effects","Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are likely to have made a number of significant
impacts on the Earth during the last billion years. We have used a
two-dimensional atmospheric model to investigate the effects on the Earth's
atmosphere of GRBs delivering a range of fluences, at various latitudes, at the
equinoxes and solstices, and at different times of day. We have estimated DNA
damage levels caused by increased solar UVB radiation, reduction in solar
visible light due to $\mathrm{NO_2}$ opacity, and deposition of nitrates
through rainout of $\mathrm{HNO_3}$. For the ``typical'' nearest burst in the
last billion years, we find globally averaged ozone depletion up to 38%.
Localized depletion reaches as much as 74%. Significant global depletion (at
least 10%) persists up to about 7 years after the burst. Our results depend
strongly on time of year and latitude over which the burst occurs. We find DNA
damage of up to 16 times the normal annual global average, well above lethal
levels for simple life forms such as phytoplankton. The greatest damage occurs
at low to mid latitudes. We find reductions in visible sunlight of a few
percent, primarily in the polar regions. Nitrate deposition similar to or
slightly greater than that currently caused by lightning is also observed,
lasting several years. We discuss how these results support the hypothesis that
the Late Ordovician mass extinction may have been initiated by a GRB.",2005-05-23T13:14:53Z
"Stars beyond Galaxies: The Origin of Extended Luminous Halos around
  Galaxies","(Abridged) We use numerical simulations to investigate the origin and
structure of the luminous halos that surround isolated galaxies. These stellar
structures extend out to several hundred kpc away from a galaxy, and consist of
stars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion events that
characterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies. Such origin suggests that
outer luminous halos are ubiquitous and that they should appear as an excess of
light over extrapolations of the galaxy's inner profile beyond its traditional
luminous radius. The mass profile of the accreted stellar component is well
approximated by a model where the logarithmic slope steepens monotonically with
radius; from -3 at the luminous edge of the galaxy to -4 or steeper near the
virial radius of the system. Such spatial distribution is consistent with that
of Galactic and M31 globular clusters, suggesting that many of the globulars
were brought in by accretion events, in a manner akin to the classic
Searle-Zinn scenario. The outer stellar spheroid is supported by a velocity
dispersion tensor with a substantial and radially increasing radial anisotropy.
These properties distinguish the stellar halo from the dark matter component,
which is more isotropic in velocity space, as well as from some tracers of the
outer spheroid such as satellite galaxies. Most stars in the outer halo formed
in progenitors that have since merged with the central galaxy; very few stars
in the halo are contributed by satellites that survive as self-bound entities
at the present. These features are in reasonable agreement with recent
observations of the outer halo of the MW, of M31, and of other isolated
spirals, and suggest that all of these systems underwent an early period of
active merging, as envisioned in hierarchical models of galaxy formation.",2005-06-27T19:56:00Z
The Spatial Distribution of Metals in the Intergalactic Medium,"We investigate the impact of environment on the metallicity of the diffuse
intergalactic medium. We use pixel correlation techniques to search for weak
CIV and OVI absorption in the spectrum of quasar Q1422+231 in regions of the
spectrum close to and far from galaxies at z ~ 3. This is achieved both by
using the positions of observed Lyman break galaxies and by using strong CIV
absorption as a proxy for the presence of galaxies near the line of sight. We
find that the metal line absorption is a strong function of not only the HI
optical depth (and thus gas density) but also proximity to highly enriched
regions (and so proximity to galaxies). The parameter ``proximity to galaxies''
can account for some, but not all, of the scatter in the strength of CIV
absorption for fixed HI. Finally, we find that even if we limit our analysis to
the two thirds of the pixels that are at least 600 km/s from any CIV line that
is strong enough to detect unambiguously (tau_CIV > 0.1), our statistical
analysis reveals only slightly less CIV for fixed HI than when we analyze the
whole spectrum. We conclude that while the metallicity is enhanced in regions
close to (Lyman-break) galaxies, the enrichment is likely to be much more
widespread than their immediate surroundings.",2005-07-04T20:22:12Z
Asteroids. From Observations to Models,"We will discuss some specific applications to the rotation state and the

"Discovery of a Galaxy Cluster in the Foreground of the Wide-Separation
  Quasar Pair UM425","We report the discovery of a cluster of galaxies in the field of UM425, a
pair of quasars separated by 6.5arcsec. Based on this finding, we revisit the
long-standing question of whether this quasar pair is a binary quasar or a
wide-separation lens. Previous work has shown that both quasars are at z=1.465
and show broad absorption lines. No evidence for a lensing galaxy has been
found between the quasars, but there were two hints of a foreground cluster:
diffuse X-ray emission observed with Chandra, and an excess of faint galaxies
observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we show, via VLT spectroscopy,
that there is a spike in the redshift histogram of galaxies at z=0.77. We
estimate the chance of finding a random velocity structure of such significance
to be about 5%, and thereby interpret the diffuse X-ray emission as originating
from z=0.77, rather than the quasar redshift. The mass of the cluster, as
estimated from either the velocity dispersion of the z=0.77 galaxies or the
X-ray luminosity of the diffuse emission, would be consistent with the
theoretical mass required for gravitational lensing. The positional offset
between the X-ray centroid and the expected location of the mass centroid is
about 40kpc, which is not too different from offsets observed in lower redshift
clusters. However, UM425 would be an unusual gravitational lens, by virtue of
the absence of a bright primary lensing galaxy. Unless the mass-to-light ratio
of the galaxy is at least 80 times larger than usual, the lensing hypothesis
requires that the galaxy group or cluster plays a uniquely important role in
producing the observed deflections.

Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile.",2005-05-12T10:35:16Z
"Asymptotic behavior of Cardassian cosmologies with exponential
  potentials","In this paper we analyze the asymptotic behavior of Cardassian cosmological
models filled with a perfect fluid and a scalar field with an exponential
potential. Cardassian cosmologies arise from modifications of the Friedmann
equation, and among the different proposals within that framework we will
choose those of the form $3H^2-\rho\propto \rho^n$ with $n<1$. We construct two
three dimensional dynamical systems arising from the evolution equations,
respectively adapted for studying the high and low energy limits. Using
standard dynamical systems techniques we find the fixed points and characterize
the solutions they represent. We pay especial attention to the properties
inherent to the modifications and compare with the (standard) unmodified
scenario. Among other interesting results, we find there are no late-time
tracking attractors.",2005-03-22T16:31:01Z
"Evidence for the presence of dust in intervening QSO absorbers from the
  Sloan Digital Sky Survey","We find evidence for dust in the intervening QSO absorbers from the spectra
of QSOs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 1. No evidence is found
for the 2175 A feature which is present in the Milky Way dust extinction curve.
The extinction curve resembles the SMC extinction curve. The observed
Delta(g-i) excess for QSOs with strong absorption systems appears to be a
result of the reddening due to dust in the intervening absorbers.",2005-04-25T05:40:22Z
Time dependent non-LTE calculations of ionisation in the early universe,"We present a new implicit numerical algorithm for the calculation of the time
dependent non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium of a gas in an external radiation
field that is accurate, fast and unconditionally stable for all spatial and
temporal increments. The method is presented as a backward difference scheme in
1-D but can be readily generalised to 3-D. We apply the method for calculating
the evolution of ionisation domains in a hydrogen plasma with plane-parallel
Gaussian density enhancements illuminated by sources of UV radiation. We
calculate the speed of propagation of ionising fronts through different ambient
densities and the interaction of such ionising fronts with density
enhancements. We show that for a typical UV source that may be present in the
early universe, the introduction of a density enhancement of a factor ~10 above
an ambient density 10^{-4} atoms/cm^3 could delay the outward propagation of an
ionisation front by millions of years. Our calculations show that within the
lifetime of a single source (~a few million years), and for ambient
intergalactic densities appropriate to redshifts z~6-20, neutral fractions of
of ~10^{-3}-10^{-5} can be achieved within its zone of influence. We also
present calculations which demonstrate that once started, ionisation will
proceed very efficiently as multiple sources are subsequently introduced, even
if the time between the appearence of such sources may be much longer than
their lifetimes.",2005-07-14T22:41:27Z
Measurement of Spin-Orbit Alignment in an Extrasolar Planetary System,"We determine the stellar, planetary, and orbital properties of the transiting
planetary system HD 209458, through a joint analysis of high-precision radial
velocities, photometry, and timing of the secondary eclipse. Of primary
interest is the strong detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, the
alteration of photospheric line profiles that occurs because the planet occults
part of the rotating surface of the star. We develop a new technique for
modeling this effect, and use it to determine the inclination of the planetary
orbit relative to the apparent stellar equator [lambda = (-4.4 +/- 1.4)
degrees], and the line-of-sight rotation speed of the star [v*sin(I) = (4.70
+/- 0.16) km/s]. The uncertainty in these quantities has been reduced by an
order of magnitude relative to the pioneering measurements by Queloz and
collaborators. The small but nonzero misalignment is probably a relic of the
planet formation epoch, because the expected timescale for tidal
coplanarization is larger than the age of the star. Our determination of
v*sin(I) is a rare case in which rotational line broadening has been isolated
from other broadening mechanisms.",2005-04-25T19:05:25Z
The counterparts of Local Group dwarf spheroidals in nearby clusters,"In this contribution, we report on the discovery of dwarf spheroidals (dSphs)
in the core of the Fornax cluster. Their photometric properties -- like
magnitude, colour, surface brightness -- are very similar to those of Local
Group dSphs. However, at a given total magnitude, dSphs in Fornax seem to be
more extended than their Local Group counterparts. The membership of several
dwarf galaxy candidates in Fornax has been confirmed by surface brightness
fluctuation measurements on deep wide-field images taken with the Magellan
telescope. The analysis of these images also confirms the flat faint end slope
of the luminosity function for dSphs in Fornax which contradicts the expected
large number of small dark matter halos connected to dwarf galaxies in
LambdaCDM theory. Dwarf spheroidals have also been detected in the Hydra I and
Centaurus cluster. A preliminary analysis of their photometric properties shows
that they obey similar scaling relations as their counterparts in Fornax and
the Local Group.",2005-05-10T12:07:02Z
XMM-Newton observations of four millisecond pulsars,"I present an analysis of the XMM-Newton observations of four millisecond
pulsars, J0437-4715, J2124-3358, J1024-0719, and J0034-0534. The new data
provide strong evidence of thermal emission in the X-ray flux detected from the
first three objects. This thermal component is best interpreted as radiation
from pulsar polar caps covered with a nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere. A
nonthermal power-law component, dominating at energies E>3 keV, can also be
present in the detected X-ray emission. For PSR J0437-4715, the timing analysis
reveals that the shape and pulsed fraction of the pulsar light curves are
energy dependent. This, together with the results obtained from the
phase-resolved spectroscopy, supports the two-component (thermal plus
nonthermal) interpretation of the pulsar's X-ray radiation. Highly significant
pulsations have been found in the X-ray flux of PSRs J2124-3358 and J1024-0719.
For PSR J0034-0534, a possible X-ray counterpart of the radio pulsar has been
suggested. The inferred properties of the detected thermal emission are
compared with predictions of radio pulsar models.",2005-07-10T16:47:03Z
"Non-Gaussianity in Multi-field Stochastic Inflation with the Scaling
  Approximation","The statistics of multi-field inflation are investigated using the stochastic
approach. We analytically obtain the probability distribution function of
fields with the scaling approximation by extending the previous work by
Amendola. The non-Gaussian nature of the probability distribution function is
investigated decomposing the fields into the adiabatic and isocurvature
components. We find that the non-Gaussianity of the isocurvature component can
be large compared with that of the adiabatic component. The adiabatic and
isocurvature components may be correlated at nonlinear order in the skewness
and kurtosis even if uncorrelated at linear level.",2005-06-16T08:33:59Z
"Hypernovae, Black-Hole-Forming Supernovae, and First Stars","Recent studies of core-collapse supernovae have revealed the existence of two
distinct classes of massive supernovae (SNe): 1) very energetic SNe
(Hypernovae), whose kinetic energy (KE) exceeds $10^{52}$ erg, about 10 times
the KE of normal core-collapse SNe, and 2) very faint and low energy SNe (E <
0.5 $\times$ $10^{51}$ erg; Faint supernovae). These two classes of supernovae
are likely to be ""black-hole-forming"" supernovae with rotating or non-rotating
black holes. We compare their nucleosynthesis yields with the abundances of
extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars to identify the Pop III (or first) supernovae.
We show that the EMP stars, especially the C-rich type, are likely to be
enriched by black-hole-forming supernovae.",2005-06-24T14:11:09Z
Mass Loss Due to Sputtering and Thermal Processes in Meteoroid Ablation,"Conventional meteoroid theory assumes that the dominant mode of ablation is
by evaporation following intense heating during atmospheric flight. In this
paper we consider the question of whether sputtering may provide an alternative
disintegration process of some importance.For meteoroids in the mass range from
10^-3 to 10^-13 kg and covering a meteor velocity range from 11 to 71 km/s, we
numerically modeled both thermal ablation and sputtering ablation during
atmospheric flight. We considered three meteoroid models believed to be
representative of asteroidal (3300 kg m^-3 mass density), cometary (1000 kg
m^-3) and porous cometary (300 kg m^-3) meteoroid structures. Atmospheric
profiles which considered the molecular compositions at different heights were
used in the sputtering calculations. We find that while in many cases
(particularly at low velocities and for relatively large meteoroid masses)
sputtering contributes only a small amount of mass loss during atmospheric
flight, in some cases sputtering is very important. For example, a 10^-10 kg
porous meteoroid at 40 km/s will lose nearly 51% of its mass by sputtering,
while a 10^-13 kg asteroidal meteoroid at 60 km/s will lose nearly 83% of its
mass by sputtering. We argue that sputtering may explain the light production
observed at very great heights in some Leonid meteors. The impact of this work
will be most dramatic for very small meteoroids such as those observed with
large aperture radars.",2005-05-13T15:16:23Z
WINGS: a WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey. I - Optical imaging,"This is the first paper of a series that will present data and scientific
results from the WINGS project, a wide-field, multiwavelength imaging and
spectroscopic survey of galaxies in 77 nearby clusters. The sample was
extracted from the ROSAT catalogs with constraints on the redshift
(0.04<z<0.07) and distance from the galactic plane (|b|>20). The global goal of
the WINGS project is the systematic study of the local cosmic variance of the
cluster population and of the properties of cluster galaxies as a function of
cluster properties and local environment. This data collection will allow to
define a local 'Zero-Point' reference against which to gauge the cosmic
evolution when compared to more distant clusters. The core of the project
consists of wide-field optical imaging of the selected clusters in the B and V
bands. We have also completed a multi-fiber, medium resolution spectroscopic
survey for 51 of the clusters in the master sample. In addition, a NIR (JK)
survey of ~50 clusters and an H_alpha + UV survey of some 10 clusters are
presently ongoing, while a very-wide-field optical survey has also been
programmed. In this paper we briefly outline the global objectives and the main
characteristics of the WINGS project. Moreover, the observing strategy and the
data reduction of the optical imaging survey (WINGS-OPT) are presented. We have
achieved a photometric accuracy of ~0.025mag, reaching completeness to V~23.5.
Field size and resolution (FWHM) span the absolute intervals (1.6-2.7)Mpc and
(0.7-1.7)kpc, respectively, depending on the redshift and on the seeing. This
allows the planned studies to get a valuable description of the local
properties of clusters and galaxies in clusters.",2005-07-11T10:54:17Z
"Gravitomagnetic Effects on Collective Plasma Oscillations in Compact
  Stars","The effects of gravitomagnetic force on plasma oscillations are investigated
using the kinetic theory of homogeneous electrically neutral plasma in the
absence of external electric or magnetic field. The random phase assumption is
employed neglecting the thermal motion of the electrons with respect to a fixed
ion background. It is found that the gravitomagnetic force reduces the
characteristic frequency of the plasma thus enhancing the refractive index of
the medium. The estimates for the predicted effects are given for a typical
white dwarf, pulsar, and neutron star.",2005-05-11T12:34:43Z
Kaon condensation in the quark-meson coupling model and compact stars,"The properties of neutron stars constituted of a crust of hadrons and an
internal part of hadrons and kaon condensate are calculated within the
quark-meson-coupling model. We have considered stars with nucleons only in the
hadron phase and also stars with hyperons as well. The results are compared
with the ones obtained from the non-linear Walecka model for the hadronic
phase.",2005-06-09T09:38:55Z
A dual emission mechanism in Sgr A*/L' ?,"We have collected in 2004 adaptive optics corrected L' images of the Galactic
Center region with NAOS-CONICA at VLT. A strong variability was observed as
well as a correlation between the photocenter positions and fluxes of the
L'-band counterpart of Sgr A*. It is interpreted as the combined emission of a
point-like flaring source at the position of Sgr A*/IR itself and an extended
dust structure, 75 mas south west of Sgr A*/IR, which we name Sgr A*-f. We
examine the different possible mechanisms to explain this dual Sgr A* L'
emission and conclude it is likely a flaring emission associated to energetic
events in the close environment of the black hole plus a quiescent emission
resulting from the collision of Sgr A*-f by a jet from Sgr A*.",2005-07-05T07:23:53Z
"Detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background using pulsar
  timing","The direct detection of gravitational waves is a major goal of current
astrophysics. We provide details of a new method for detecting a stochastic
background of gravitational waves using pulsar timing data. Our results show
that regular timing observations of 40 pulsars each with a timing accuracy of
100 nano-seconds will be able to make a direct detection of the predicted
stochastic background from coalescing black holes within five years. With an
improved pre-whitening algorithm, or if the background is at the upper end of
the predicted range, a significant detection should be possible with only 20
pulsars.",2005-04-21T05:49:46Z
Relic abundance of mass-varying cold dark matter particles,"In models of coupled dark energy and dark matter the mass of the dark matter
particle depends on the cosmological evolution of the dark energy field. In
this note we exemplify in a simple model the effects of this mass variation on
the relic abundance of cold dark matter.",2005-04-05T18:10:05Z
"Cooling of Quark Stars in the Color Superconductive Phase: Effect of
  Photons from Glueball decay","The cooling history of a quark star in the color superconductive phase is
investigated. Here we specifically focus on the 2-flavour color (2SC) phase
where novel process of photon generation via glueball (GLB) decay have been
already investigated (Ouyed & Sannino 2001). The picture we present here can in
principle be generalized to quark stars entering a superconductive phase where
similar photon generation mechanisms are at play. As much as 10^{45}-10^{47}
erg of energy is provided by the GLB decay in the 2SC phase. The generated
photons slowly diffuse out of the quark star keeping it hot and radiating as a
black-body (with possibly a Wien spectrum in gamma-rays) for millions of years.
We discuss hot radio-quiet isolated neutron stars in our picture (such as RX
J185635-3754 and RX J0720.4-3125) and argue that their nearly blackbody spectra
(with a few broad features) and their remarkably tiny hydrogen atmosphere are
indications that these might be quark stars in the color superconductive phase
where some sort of photon generation mechanism (reminiscent of the GLB decay)
has taken place. Fits to observed data of cooling compact stars favor models
with superconductive gaps of Delta_2SC = 15-35 MeV and densities
rho_2SC=(2.5-3.0)rho_N (rho_N being the nuclear matter saturation density) for
quark matter in the 2SC phase. If correct, our model combined with more
observations of isolated compact stars could provide vital information to
studies of quark matter and its exotic phases.",2005-04-18T14:41:46Z
"An unexpectedly rapid decline in the X-ray afterglow emission of long
  gamma-ray bursts","Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are commonly accepted to originate in the
explosion of particularly massive stars, which gives rise to a highly
relativistic jet. Internal inhomogeneities in the expanding flow give rise to
internal shock waves that are believed to produce the gamma-rays we see. As the
jet travels further outward into the surrounding circumstellar medium
`external' shocks give rise to the afterglow emission seen in the X-ray,
optical and radio bands. Here we report on the early phases of the X-ray
emission of five GRBs. Their X-ray light curves are characterised by a rapid
fall-off for the first few hundred seconds, followed by a less rapid decline
lasting several hours. This steep decline, together with detailed spectral
properties of two particular bursts, shows that violent shock interactions take
place in the early jet outflows.",2005-06-16T13:08:38Z
"The Molecular Condensations Ahead of Herbig-Haro Objects. III. Radiative
  and dynamical perturbations of the HH 2 condensation","We have carried out an extensive observational study (from BIMA data) and
made a preliminary theoretical investigation of the molecular gas around HH2.
The molecular maps show a very complex morphological, kinematical and chemical
structure. The overall main conclusion of this work confirms the findings of
Paper I and II, by demonstrating that in addition to the strong photochemical
effects caused by penetration of the UV photons from HH2 into molecular cloud,
a range of complex radiative and dynamical interactions occur. Thus, despite
the apparent `quiescent' nature of the molecular cloud ahead of HH2, the
kinematical properties observed within the field of view suggest that it is
possibly being driven out by powerful winds from the VLA 1 protostar.",2005-04-15T13:41:58Z
"Effective equation of state for dark energy: mimicking quintessence and
  phantom energy through a variable Lambda","While there is mounting evidence in all fronts of experimental cosmology for
a non-vanishing dark energy component in the Universe, we are still far away
from understanding its ultimate nature. A fundamental cosmological constant,
Lambda, is the most natural candidate, but many dynamical mechanisms to
generate an effective Lambda have been devised which postulate the existence of
a peculiar scalar field (so-called quintessence, and generalizations thereof).
These models are essentially ad hoc, but they lead to the attractive
possibility of a time-evolving dark energy with a non-trivial equation of state
(EOS). Most, if not all, future experimental studies on precision cosmology
(e.g. the SNAP and PLANCK projects) address very carefully the determination of
an EOS parametrized ``a la quintessence''. Here we show that by fitting
cosmological data to an EOS of that kind can also be interpreted as a hint of a
fundamental, but time-evolving, cosmological term: Lambda=Lambda(t). We
exemplify this possibility by studying the effective EOS associated to a
renormalization group (RG) model for Lambda. We find that the effective EOS can
correspond to both normal quintessence and phantom dark energy, depending on
the value of a single parameter of the RG model. We conclude that behind a
non-trivial EOS of a purported quintessence or phantom scalar field there can
actually be a running cosmological term of a fundamental quantum field theory.",2005-05-06T18:28:51Z
"Erupting Cataclysmic Variable Stars in the Nearest Globular Cluster, NGC
  6397: Intermediate Polars?","NGC 6397 is the closest globular cluster, and hence the ideal place to search
for faint stellar populations such as cataclysmic variables (CVs). HST and
Chandra observers have identified nine certain and likely CVs in this nearby
cluster, including several magnetic CV candidates. We have combined our recent
UV imagery with archival HST images of NGC 6397 to search for new CV candidates
and especially to look for dwarf nova-like eruptive events. We find remarkable
and somewhat unexpected dwarf nova-like eruptions of the two well-known
cataclysmic systems CV2 and CV3. These two objects have been claimed to be {\it
magnetic} CVs, as indicated by their helium emission-line spectra. Magnetic
fields in CVs are usually expected to prevent the disk instability that leads
to dwarf nova eruptions. In fact, most field magnetic CVs are observed to not
undergo eruptions. Our observations of the dwarf nova eruptions of CV2 and CV3
can be reconciled with these objects' HeII emission lines if both objects are
infrequently-erupting intermediate polars, similar to EX Hya. If this is the
case for most globular cluster CVs then we can reconcile the many X-ray and UV
bright CV candidates seen by Chandra and HST with the very small numbers of
erupting dwarf novae observed in cluster cores.",2005-06-28T22:29:09Z
Inflation with violation of the null energy condition,"Inflation may have been driven by a component which violated the Null-Energy
Condition, thereby leading to {\it super inflation}. We provide the formalism
to study cosmological perturbations when such a component is described by a
scalar field with arbitrary Lagrangian. Since the background curvature grows
with time, gravitational waves always have a blue spectrum. Scalar
perturbations may also have a blue spectrum, {\em albeit} in single field
models. We apply our formalism to the case of phantom inflation with an
exponential potential (whose pole-like inflationary stage is an attractor for
inhomogeneous cosmological models for any value of the potential slope). We
finally compare the predictions of super inflation with those of standard
inflation stressing the role of gravitational waves.",2005-05-27T13:07:36Z
Optical Sources Near the Bright X-Ray Source in NGC 1073,"New HST observations show that the bright X-ray source in the face-on spiral
galaxy NGC 1073 is located near a ring of recent star formation with an age of
8-16 Myr. This strengthens the association of X-ray sources in spiral galaxies
emitting near or above the Eddington limit for a 20 solar mass black hole with
recent star formation events. Two candidate optical counterparts of the X-ray
source are found. The X-ray to optical flux ratios of both are consistent with
those of low-mass X-ray binaries and higher than most high-mass X-ray binaries,
suggesting that reprocessing of X-rays contributes to the optical light. The
optical magnitude and color of one candidate is consistent with that predicted
for an X-ray binary with an initial donor mass of 6-8 solar masses. However,
the same X-ray binary evolution model underestimates the X-ray luminosity. An
X-ray source list for the field is presented which includes detections of the
nucleus of NGC 1073, three quasars, and an M3e brown dwarf star with high
proper motion.",2005-05-02T16:12:14Z
A Multiplicity Survey of the Rho Ophiuchi Molecular Clouds,"We present a volume-limited multiplicity survey with magnitude cutoff (K =<
10.5 mag) of 158 young stellar objects located within or in the vicinity of the
Rho Ophiuchi Dark Cloud. With exception of eleven already well observed
objects, all sources have been observed by us in the K-band with 3.5m
telescopes by using speckle techniques. The separation range covered by our
survey is [0.13'',6.4''], where the lower limit is given by the diffraction
limit of the telescopes and the upper limit by confusion with background stars.
The multiplicity survey is complete for flux ratios => 0.1 (=< 2.5 mag) at the
diffraction limit. After taking the background density into account the degree
of multiplicity is 29.1%+-4.3% and thus only marginally higher than the value
23.5%+-4.8%derived for the given separation range for the main-sequence
solar-like stars in the solar neighbourhood (Duquennoy & Mayor 1991). We
discuss the implications of these findings.",2005-04-27T12:38:32Z
Probing the interior of neutron stars with gravitational waves,"We show here how the internal structure of a neutron star can be inferred
from its gravitational wave spectrum. Under the premise that the frequencies
and damping rates of a few $w$-mode oscillations are found, we apply an
inversion scheme to determine its mass, radius and density distribution. In
addition, accurate equation of state of nuclear matter can also be determined.",2005-06-28T02:41:28Z
"Discovery of an M4 Spectroscopic Binary in Upper Scorpius: A Calibration
  Point for Young Low-Mass Evolutionary Models","We report the discovery of a new low-mass spectroscopic (SB2) stellar binary
system in the star-forming region of Upper Scorpius. This object, UScoCTIO5,
was discovered by Ardila (2000), who assigned it a spectral class of M4. A
KeckI HIRES spectrum revealed it to be double-lined, and we then carried out a
program at several observatories to determine its orbit. The orbital period is
34 days, and the eccentricity is nearly 0.3. The importance of such a discovery
is that it can be used to help calibrate evolutionary models at low masses and
young ages. This is one of the outstanding problems in the study of formation
mechanisms and initial mass functions at low masses. The orbit allows us to
place a lower limit of 0.64 +- 0.02 M_sol on the total system mass. The
components appear to be of almost equal mass. We are able to show that this
mass is significantly higher than predicted by evolutionary models for an
object of this luminosity and age, in agreement with other recent results. More
precise determination of the temperature and surface gravity of the components
would be helpful in further solidifying this conclusion.",2005-06-21T17:14:38Z
"Spectroscopy and Stellar Populations of Star-forming Galaxies at z~3 in
  the Hubble Deep Field - South","We present results of VLT/FORS2 spectroscopy of galaxies at z~3 in the Hubble
Deep Field-South (HDF-S). A sample of galaxies was drawn from the photo-z
catalogue based on the HST/WFPC2 optical images and the deep near-infrared
images obtained with VLT/ISAAC as a part of the FIRES project. We selected
galaxies with photometric redshift between 2.5 and 4. Most of the selected
galaxies are bright in rest-frame UV wavelengths and satisfy color selection
criteria of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3. The number of target galaxies
with I(AB)<25.0 was 15. We identified new 5 firm and 2 probable redshifts in
addition to confirmations of previously known 6 galaxies at z~3. We found 6
among these 13 galaxies lie at a quite narrow redshift range at z = 2.80+-0.01.
We examined stellar populations of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts
through comparisons of their optical and near-IR photometry data with template
spectra generated by a population synthesis code. The ages from the onset of
star formation for these star-forming galaxies with I<=25.0 are typically
50-200 Myr, and their stellar masses are between (0.5-5) x 10^10 M_sun,
consistent with previous studies. We also compared these SED fitting results
with those for distant red galaxies (DRGs) at z>2 discovered by FIRES. DRGs
have larger stellar masses, larger dust attenuation than our UV-luminous LBG
sample, and their star formation rates are often comparable to LBGs. These
trends suggest that majority of DRGs are indeed the most massive systems at the
redshift and are still in the active star-forming phase. Unless the number
density of DRGs is much smaller than LBGs, estimates based on UV selected
sample could miss substantial part of stellar mass density at z~3.",2005-05-26T10:21:48Z
"An Investigation of Diffuse Interstellar Gas toward a Large, Low
  Extinction Window into the Inner Galaxy","Halpha and Hbeta spectroscopy with the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM)
reveals a strong concentration of high velocity emission in a ~ 5 by 5 deg area
centered near (l.b) = (27,-3), known as the Scutum Cloud. The high velocities
imply that we are detecting optical emission from near the plane of the Galaxy
out to the tangent point at heliocentric distances of D \gtrsim 6 kpc, assuming
the gas participates in circular Galactic rotation. The ratio of the Halpha to
Hbeta emission as a function of velocity suggests that dust along these lines
of sight produces a total visual extinction of A_v ~ 3 at D ~ 6 kpc. This makes
it possible to use optical emission lines to explore the physical conditions of
ionized gas in the inner Galaxy. At a Galactocentric distance R_G ~ 4 kpc, for
example, we find that the H^+ has an rms midplane density of ~ 1 cm^-3 with a
vertical scale height of ~ 300 pc. We also find evidence for an increase in the
flux of Lyman continuum photons and an increase in the ratio of ionized to
neutral hydrogen toward the inner Galaxy. We have extended the measurements of
E(B-V) in this direction to distances far beyond what has been accessible
through stellar photometry and find E(B-V)/N_H to be near the local mean of 1.7
x 10^-22 cm^2 mag, with evidence for an increase in this ratio at R_G ~ 4 kpc.
Finally, our observations of [NII] 6583, [SII] 6716, and [OIII] 5007 toward the
window reveal that in the inner Galaxy the temperature of the gas and the
ionization state of oxygen increase with increasing height from the midplane.",2005-05-24T05:50:47Z
Diffraction Analysis of 2-D Pupil Mapping for High-Contrast Imaging,"Pupil-mapping is a technique whereby a uniformly-illuminated input pupil,
such as from starlight, can be mapped into a non-uniformly illuminated exit
pupil, such that the image formed from this pupil will have suppressed
sidelobes, many orders of magnitude weaker than classical Airy ring
intensities. Pupil mapping is therefore a candidate technique for coronagraphic
imaging of extrasolar planets around nearby stars. Unlike most other
high-contrast imaging techniques, pupil mapping is lossless and preserves the
full angular resolution of the collecting telescope. So, it could possibly give
the highest signal-to-noise ratio of any proposed single-telescope system for
detecting extrasolar planets. Prior analyses based on pupil-to-pupil
ray-tracing indicate that a planet fainter than 10^{-10} times its parent star,
and as close as about 2 lambda/D, should be detectable. In this paper, we
describe the results of careful diffraction analysis of pupil mapping systems.
These results reveal a serious unresolved issue. Namely, high-contrast pupil
mappings distribute light from very near the edge of the first pupil to a broad
area of the second pupil and this dramatically amplifies diffraction-based edge
effects resulting in a limiting attainable contrast of about 10^{-5}. We hope
that by identifying this problem others will provide a solution.",2005-06-22T22:20:25Z
The Nature of Dark Matter,"The observed strong dark-to-luminous matter coupling suggests the existence
of a some functional relation between visible and DM sources which leads to
biased Einstein equations. We show that such a bias appears in the case when
the topological structure of the actual Universe at very large distances does
not match properly that of the Friedman space. We introduce a bias operator
$\rho_{DM} = B \rho_{vis}$ and show that the simple bias function $b \~1/r^{2}$
(the kernel of $B$) allows to account for all the variety of observed DM halos
in astrophysical systems. In galaxies such a bias forms the cored DM
distribution with the radius $R_{C}\sim R_{opt}$ (which explains the recently
observed strong correlation between $R_{C}$ and $R_{opt}$), while for a point
source it produces the logarithmic correction to the Newton's potential (which
explains the observed flat rotation curves in spirals). Finally, we show that
in the theory suggested the galaxy formation process leads to a specific
variation with time of all interaction constants and, in particular, of the
fine structure constant.",2005-05-06T17:37:36Z
"On the relationship between auroral and nebular oxygen line intensities
  in spectra of HII regions","We investigate relationships between observed auroral and nebular oxygen line
fluxes in spectra of HII regions. We find a relation that is
metallicity-dependent at low metallicities, but becomes independent of
metallicity (within the uncertainties of the available data) above 12+logO/H ~
8.25, i.e. there is one-to-one correspondance (the ff - relation) between
auroral and nebular oxygen line fluxes in spectra of high-metallicity HII
regions. The ff - relation allows one to estimate the flux in the auroral line
from strong oxygen line measurements. This solves the problem of the electron
temperature (and, consequently, abundance) determination in high-metallicity
HII regions. The ff - relation confirms the basic idea of the empirical method,
proposed by Pagel et al. (1979) a qurter of a century ago, that the oxygen
abundance in HII region can be estimated from the strong oxygen lines
measurements only.",2005-04-18T11:10:20Z
"Pulsar timing and the detection of black hole binary systems in globular
  clusters","The possible existence of intermediate mass binary black holes (IMBBHs) in
globular clusters (GCs) offers a unique geometry in which to detect space-time
oscillations. For certain pulsar-IMBBH configurations possible within a GC, the
usual far-field plane wave approximation for the IMBBH metric perturbation
severely underestimates the magnitude of the induced pulsar pulse
time-of-arrival (TOA) fluctuations. In this letter, the expected TOA
fluctuations induced by an IMBBH lying close to the line-of-sight between a
pulsar and the Earth are calculated for the first time. For an IMBBH consisting
of 10 Msolar and 10^3 Msolar components, a 10 year orbital period, and located
0.1 lyr from the Earth-Pulsar line of sight, the induced pulsar timing residual
amplitude will be of order 5 to 500 ns.",2005-05-29T20:45:47Z
X-ray Emission from the Weak-lined T Tauri Binary System KH 15D,"The unique eclipsing, weak-lined T Tauri star KH 15D has been detected as an
X-ray source in a 95.7 ks exposure from the Chandra X-ray Observatory archives.
A maximum X-ray luminosity of 1.5 x 10^{29} erg s$^{-1}$ is derived in the
0.5--8 keV band, corresponding to L_{X}/L_bol = 7.5 x 10^{-5}. Comparison with
samples of stars of similar effective temperature in NGC 2264 and in the Orion
Nebula Cluster shows that this is about an order of magnitude low for a typical
star of its mass and age. We argue that the relatively low luminosity cannot be
attributed to absorption along the line of sight but implies a real deficiency
in X-ray production. Possible causes for this are considered in the context of
a recently proposed eccentric binary model for KH 15D. In particular, we note
that the visible component rotates rather slowly for a weak-lined T Tauri star
and has possibly been pseudosynchronized by tidal interaction with the primary
near periastron.",2005-06-08T12:53:11Z
Nanodiamond dust and the far-ultraviolet quasar break,"We explore the possibility that the steepening observed shortward of 1000A in
the energy distribution of quasars may result from absorption by dust, being
either intrinsic to the quasar environment or intergalactic. We find that a
dust extinction curve consisting of nanodiamonds, composed of terrestrial cubic
diamonds or with surface impurities as found in carbonaceous chondrite
meteorites, such as Allende, is successful in reproducing the sharp break
observed. The intergalactic dust model is partially successful in explaining
the shape of the composite energy distribution, but must be discarded in the
end, as the amount of crystalline dust required is unreasonable and would imply
an improbable fine tuning among the dust formation processes. The alternative
intrinsic dust model requires a mixture of both cubic diamonds and Allende
nanodiamonds and provide a better fit of the UV break. The gas column densities
implied are of the order 10^{20} cm^{-2} assuming solar metallicity for carbon
and full depletion of carbon into dust. The absorption only occurs in the
ultraviolet and is totally negligible in the visible. The minimum dust mass
required is of the order ~ 0.003 r_{pc}^{2}M_o, where r_{pc} is the distance in
parsec between the dust screen and the continuum source. The intrinsic dust
model reproduces the flux {\it rise} observed around 660A in key quasar spectra
quite well. We present indirect evidence of a shallow continuum break near 670A
(18.5 eV), which would be intrinsic to the quasar continuum.",2005-05-29T23:48:15Z
Lectures on High-Energy Neutrino Astronomy,"Kilometer-scale neutrino detectors such as IceCube are discovery instruments
covering nuclear and partile physics, cosmology and astronomy. Examples of
their multidisciplinary mission include the search for the particle nature of

kilometer-scale detectors and the status and methodologies of current
detectors.",2005-06-10T19:45:40Z
Understanding our Origins: Star Formation in H II Region Environments,"Recent analysis of the decay products of short-lived radiounclides (SLRs) in
meteorites, in particular the confirmation of the presence of live 60Fe in the
early Solar System, provides unambiguous evidence that the Sun and Solar System
formed near a massive star. We consider the question of the formation of
low-mass stars in environments near massive stars, presenting a scenario for
the evolution of a star and its disk around the periphery of an expanding H II
region. The stages in this scenario begin with compression of molecular gas
around the edge of an H II region, continue as forming stars are overrun by the
advancing ionization front, and culminate when ejecta from one or more nearby
supernova explosions sweeps over YSO disks located in the low density interior
of the H II region, injecting SLRs including 26Al and 60Fe. We review the
evidence that this mode of star formation is more characteristic of formation
of low-mass stars than is the mode of star formation seen in regions such as
the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud. We discuss the implications of this scenario
for our understanding of star formation, as well as the effects of the young
Sun's astrophysical environment on the formation and evolution of the Solar
System. We conclude that low-mass stars and their accompanying disks form and
evolve very differently near massive stars than they do in regions like
Taurus-Auriga, and that these differences have profound implications for our
understanding of our origins.",2005-06-09T00:27:34Z
ISO observations and models of galaxies with Hidden Broad Line Regions,"We present ISO mid-infrared spectrophotometry and far-infrared photometry of
galaxies with Hidden Broad Line Regions (HBLR). We also present radiative
transfer models of their spectral energy distributions which enable us to
separate the contributions from the dusty disc of the AGN and the dusty
starbursts. We find that the combination of tapered discs (discs whose
thickness increases with distance from the central source in the inner part but
stays constant in the outer part) and starbursts provide good fits to the data.
The tapered discs dominate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum and the
starbursts in the far-infrared. After correcting the AGN luminosity for
anisotropic emission we find that the ratio of the AGN luminosity to the
starburst luminosity, L(AGN)/L(SB), ranges from about unity for IRAS14454-4343
to about 13 for IRAS01475-0740. Our results suggest that the warm IRAS colours
of HBLR are due to the relatively high L(AGN)/L(SB). Our fits are consistent
with the unified model and the idea that the infrared emission of AGN is
dominated by a dusty disc in the mid-infrared and starbursts in the
far-infrared.",2005-04-20T07:56:11Z
DDO 43: A Prototypical Dwarf Irregular Galaxy?,"We present sensitive and high resolution 21 cm observations of the dwarf
irregular (dIm) galaxy DDO 43, in conjunction with optical broad and narrow
band images in U, B, V, and Halpha. The observations are used to examine the
relationship between its HI morphology and kinematics to past and present star
formation. Optically, it is a small (R_25 = 990 pc), faint (M_B of -14.0) Im
with a slightly boxy shape. In HI, DDO 43 has an extended (R_HI/R_Ho = 2.8) gas
envelope. There is a high density ridge associated with the optical body of the
galaxy, containing several higher density knots and lower density holes. The
largest hole is ~850x530 pc. No expansion is detected, so it must be relatively
old. The largest and potentially oldest (7-70 Myr) of the six identified star
clusters is located at the western edge of the hole. Four of the other clusters
are located near high density peaks. There are several HII regions, most of
which are associated with peaks in the HI surface density. The overall star
formation rate is average for its type. In many ways, DDO 43 is a very typical
dwarf irregular galaxy. Its HI morphology is consistent with a history of
episodes of localized star ormation that create holes and shells in the ISM,
some of which can overlap. These features are located within the area of
solid-body rotation in the galaxy; the lack of shear in these small systems
allows such structures to persist for long periods of time.",2005-06-06T16:07:38Z
Atmospheric dynamics in carbon-rich Miras. II. Models meet observations,"Originating in different depths of the very extended atmospheres of AGB
stars, various molecular spectral lines observable in the near-infrared show
diverse behaviours and can be used to probe atmospheric dynamics throughout the
outer layers of these pulsating red giants. In Nowotny et al. (2005, Paper I)
time series of synthetic high-resolution spectra were presented, computed from
a dynamic model atmosphere for a typical carbon-rich Mira. In this work, line
profile shapes, their variations during the lightcycle and radial velocities
derived from wavelength shifts are analyzed and compared with results from
observed FTS spectra of the C-rich Mira S Cep and other Miras. It is found that
the global velocity structure of the model is in qualitative agreement with
observations. Radial velocities of molecular lines sampling different layers
behave comparably, although some differences are apparant concerning absolute
values. A correction factor of p=1.36 between measured RVs and actual gas
velocities is derived for CO dv=3 lines. It is shown that dynamic model
atmospheres are capable of reproducing Mira spectra without introducing an
additional ''static layer'' proposed by several authors.",2005-03-30T12:43:37Z
"Simulating the High Energy Gamma-ray sky seen by the GLAST Large Area
  Telescope","This paper presents the simulation of the GLAST high energy gamma-ray
telescope. The simulation package, written in C++, is based on the Geant4
toolkit, and it is integrated into a general framework used to process events.
A detailed simulation of the electronic signals inside Silicon detectors has
been provided and it is used for the particle tracking, which is handled by a
dedicated software. A unique repository for the geometrical description of the
detector has been realized using the XML language and a C++ library to access
this information has been designed and implemented. A new event display based
on the HepRep protocol was implemented. The full simulation was used to
simulate a full week of GLAST high energy gamma-ray observations. This paper
outlines the contribution developed by the Italian GLAST software group.",2005-03-24T15:42:54Z
Did Boomerang hit MOND?,"Purely baryonic dark matter dominated models like MOND based on modification
of Newtonian gravity have been successfully in reproducing some dynamical
properties of galaxies. More recently, a relativistic formulation of MOND
proposed by Bekenstein seems to agree with cosmological large scale structure
formation. In this work, we revise the agreement of MOND with observations in
light of the new results on the Cosmic Microwave Anisotropies provided by the
2003 flight of Boomerang. The measurements of the height of the third acoustic
peak, provided by several small scale CMB experiments have reached enough
sensitivity to severely constrain models without cold dark matter. Assuming
that acoustic peak structure in the CMB is unchanged and that local
measurements of the Hubble constant can be applied, we find that the cold dark
matter is strongly favoured with Bayesian probability ratio of about one in two
hundred.",2005-08-02T18:33:02Z
A Spectroscopic Study of HL Canis Majoris,"We present optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova HL Canis Majoris over a
span of four years. The observations were made during standstill, outburst, and
quiescence. We determine an orbital period of 0.2167867 +/- 0.0000017 days,
based on radial velocities determined from H-alpha, H-beta, and He I 5876
emission. We also present equivalent widths of the spectral features in
outburst and in quiescence.",2005-06-02T22:01:15Z
Fast directional continuous spherical wavelet transform algorithms,"We describe the construction of a spherical wavelet analysis through the
inverse stereographic projection of the Euclidean planar wavelet framework,
introduced originally by Antoine and Vandergheynst and developed further by
Wiaux et al. Fast algorithms for performing the directional continuous wavelet
analysis on the unit sphere are presented. The fast directional algorithm,
based on the fast spherical convolution algorithm developed by Wandelt and
Gorski, provides a saving of O(sqrt(Npix)) over a direct quadrature
implementation for Npix pixels on the sphere, and allows one to perform a
directional spherical wavelet analysis of a 10^6 pixel map on a personal
computer.",2005-06-14T15:01:53Z
"Fluorescence and Hybrid Detection Aperture of the Pierre Auger
  Observatory","The aperture of the Fluorescence Detector (FD) of the Pierre Auger
Observatory is evaluated from simulated events using different detector
configurations: mono, stereo, 3-FD and 4-FD. The trigger efficiency has been
modeled using shower profiles with ground impacts in the field of view of a
single telescope and studying the trigger response (at the different levels) by
that telescope and by its neighbours. In addition, analysis cuts imposed by
event reconstruction have been applied. The hybrid aperture is then derived for
the Auger final extension. Taking into account the actual Surface Detector (SD)
array configuration and its trigger response, the aperture is also calculated
for a typical configuration of the present phase.",2005-07-05T17:24:07Z
Heavy element abundances in DAO white dwarfs measured from FUSE data,"We present heavy element abundance measurements for 16 DAO white dwarfs,
determined from Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer {FUSE} spectra. Evidence
of absorption by heavy elements was found in the spectra of all the objects.
Measurements were made using models that adopted the temperatures, gravities
and helium abundances determined from both optical and FUSE data by Good et al.
(2004). Despite the different evolutionary paths that the types of DAO white
dwarfs are thought to evolve through, their abundances were not found to vary
significantly, apart from for the silicon abundances. Abundances measured when
the FUSE derived values of temperature, gravity and helium abundance were
adopted were, in general, a factor 1-10 higher than those determined when the
optical measure of those parameters was used. Satisfactory fits to the
absorption lines were achieved in approximately equal number. The models that
used the FUSE determined parameters seemed better at reproducing the strength
of the nitrogen and iron lines, while for oxygen, the optical parameters were
better.",2005-07-14T18:27:52Z
The ALHAMBRA Survey: For a systematic Study of Cosmic Evolution,"ALHAMBRA is a project to gather data to sample a fraction of the Universe
with enough precision to follow the evolution of its content and properties
with z, a kind of Cosmic Tomography. It is defined as a 4 square degrees
photometric survey with 20 contiguous, equal width, medium band filters
covering from 3500 to 9700 A, plus the JHKs NIR bands. It was optimized to get
(for a fixed observing time) the maximum number of objects with accurate
classification and redshift and to be sensitive to relatively faint emission
features. The observations will be carried out with the 3.5m telescope in Calar
Alto (Spain). We intend to reach the limit AB=25 in all the optical filters
from the bluest to 8300 A, and from 24.7 to 23.4 for the remainder. The
expected limit in the NIR is fixed at Ks=20, H=21, J=22. The homogeneous and
contiguous spectral coverage will result in several hundred thousand objects
with accurate SED identification and z-values. The accuracy of the survey will
allow to make detailed studies, including galactic, without the need for any
further follow-up. Indeed, it will provide exciting targets for large
telescopes, the GTC in particular.",2005-04-25T15:23:58Z
X-ray Emission from NGC 1808: More than a Complex Starburst,"Earlier observations of NGC 1808 in various wavebands (X-ray, optical,
near-infrared, radio) provided evidence for the existence of either a starburst
or a Seyfert 2 nucleus. We here present the results of multiwavelength
XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, which directly prove the co-existence of
thermal diffuse plasma and non-nuclear unresolved point-like sources associated
with the starburst activity, along with a Low Luminosity Active Galactic
Nucleus (LLAGN) or an Ultra Luminous X-ray source (ULX). The broad bandwidth of
XMM-Newton allows us to show that the unresolved nuclear source in NGC 1808
dominates the hard X-ray spectrum, while the emission in the soft regime, below
1 keV, is dominated by a thermal component associated to an extended starburst.
Both EPIC and RGS data provide reliable detections of a number of emission
lines from heavy elements, with abundances ranging from roughly 0.7 to 2.2
Z_sol for different elements. However, no 6.4 keV Fe K-alpha fluorescence line
emission was detected. The analysis of the nuclear region of NGC 1808 allows us
to detect and disentangle the contribution of an unresolved nuclear X-ray
source and the starburst region, but the exact nature of the nucleus remains
unknown. The observed luminosity of NGC 1808 is L(2-10 keV)=(1.61+/-0.06)E+40
erg/s. A comparison of our OM 212 nm image with a CTIO 4-m telescope H-alpha
frame shows a good general correspondence between the emission from massive
stars and warm ionized gas, with minor deviations near the ends of the bar in
NGC 1808. An aditional, very soft thermal spectral component with kT~0.1 keV
has been discovered in the XMM-Newton spectral analysis, which most likely
originates from the halo of NGC 1808.",2005-06-30T16:44:43Z
The Birth of Massive Stars and Star Clusters,"In the present-day universe, it appears that most, and perhaps all, massive
stars are born in star clusters. It also appears that all star clusters contain
stars drawn from an approximately universal initial mass function, so that
almost all rich young star clusters contain massive stars. In this review I
discuss the physical processes associated with both massive star formation and
with star cluster formation. First I summarize the observed properties of
star-forming gas clumps, then address the following questions. How do these
clumps emerge from giant molecular clouds? In these clustered environments, how
do individual stars form and gain mass? Can a forming star cluster be treated
as an equilibrium system or is this process too rapid for equilibrium to be
established? How does feedback affect the formation process?",2005-04-11T21:36:10Z
Probing dark matter caustics with weak lensing,"Caustics are high-density structures that form frequently in collisionless
media. Under self-gravity, cold dark matter flows focus onto caustics which are
yet to be resolved in numerical simulations and or observed in the real world.
If detected, caustics would provide a strong evidence for dark matter and would
rule out alternative models such as those with modified dynamics. Here, we
demonstrate how they might be observed in the weak lensing data. We evaluate
the shear distortion and show that its radial profile is marked by a
characteristic sawtooth pattern due to the caustics in dark matter haloes that
form by selfsimilar accretion. We discuss the observational complications,
mainly due to the poor knowledge of the virial radii of the haloes and
demonstrate that a superposition of about 300 cluster-size haloes would give a
signal-to-noise ratio which is sufficiently large for the detection of caustics
with ground-based observations. This number is reduced to 100 for space-based
observations. These bounds can be easily achieved by the ongoing wide field
optical surveys such as CFHTLS and the future space-based projects SNAP and
DUNE which have to be accompanied by a X-ray follow-up of the selected clusters
for a precise determination of their virial radii.",2005-06-02T15:36:22Z
Limits on stochastic magnetic fields: A defense of our paper [1],"In their recent paper ``Faraday rotation of the cosmic microwave background

amplitude of a primordial magnetic field from gravitational wave production.
They argue that our limits are erroneous. In this short comment we defend our

Brief history of the metal accumulation in the intracluster medium,"We use models of the rates of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and core-collapse
supernovae, built in such a way that both are consistent with recent
observational constraints at z<1.6 and can reproduce the measured cosmic star
formation rate, to recover the history of the metals accumulation in the
intra-cluster medium. We show that these SN rates, in unit of SN number per
comoving volume and rest-frame year, provide on average a total amount of Iron
that is marginally consistent with the value measured in galaxy clusters in the
redshift range 0-1, and a relative evolution with redshift that is in agreement
with the observational constraints up to z~1.2. Moreover, we verify that the
predicted metals to Iron ratios reproduce the measurements obtained in nearby
clusters through X-ray analysis, implying that (1) about half of the Iron mass
and >75 per cent of the Nickel mass observed locally are produced by SN Ia
ejecta, (2) the SN Ia contribution to the metal budget decreases steeply with
redshift and by z~1 is already less than half of the local amount and (3) a
transition in the abundance ratios relative to the Iron is present between
redshifts ~0.5 and 1.4, with core-collapse SN products becoming dominant at
higher redshifts.",2005-06-13T14:31:24Z
Open issues in gamma-ray bursts: polarimetry and dark GRBs,"We review some open problems in the physics of afterglows, namely their
polarization properties and the existence of dark/faint bursts. Polarization
studies yield precious insights in the physical structure and dynamical
evolution of GRB jets, revealing their magnetization properties and their
energy profile. Polarimetric observations of GRB 020813 already allowed to
exclude a homogeneous jet for this event. We then present observations of
faint/dark bursts, showing that some of them may be obscured by dust, while
others are possibly just intrinsically dim.",2005-05-13T18:17:57Z
Gamma-ray and neutrino emission from misaligned microquasars,"Microquasars are accreting X-ray binary systems with non-thermal radio jets.
In some of these systems the jet is expected to be strongly misaligned with the
perpendicular to the orbital plane. If the donor star is an early-type star,
the jet could collide with the stellar wind producing a standing shock between
the compact object and the stellar surface. Relativistic particles injected by
the jet can be re-accelerated and isotropized at the colliding region. If the
jet has hadronic content, TeV protons will diffuse into the inner, dense wind
leading to gamma-ray and neutrino production from interactions with the matter
of the wind. In the case of very powerful jets, the wind pressure can be
overbalanced and the jet might impact directly onto the stellar surface. We
present estimates of the gamma-ray and neutrino luminosities for different sets
of parameters in these scenarios and we briefly discuss the effects of this
radiation on the donor star and its detectability with current instruments.",2005-05-13T15:15:22Z
"Source blending effects on microlensing time-histograms and optical
  depth determination","Source blending in microlensing experiments is known to modify the Einstein
time of the observed events. In this paper, we have conducted Monte-Carlo
calculations, using the analytical relationships derived by Han (1999) to
quantify the effect of blending on the observed event time distribution and
optical depth. We show that short-time events are affected significantly by
source blending and that, for moderately blended sources, the optical depth
$\tau$ is globally overestimated, because of an underestimation of the
exposure. For high blending situations, on the opposite, blending leads to an
{\it under}estimation of the optical depth. Our results are in agreement with
the most recent optical depth determinations toward the Galactic Center of the
MACHO collaboration (Popowski et al. 2004) and the OGLE-II collaboration (Sumi
et al. 2005) that use clump giants (less affected by the blending effect) as
sources. The blending-corrected, lower optical depth toward the Galactic Bulge
is now in good agreement with the value inferred from galactic models,
reconciling theoretical and observational determinations.",2005-07-07T17:06:59Z
"Feedback and metal enrichment in cosmological SPH simulations I. A model
  for chemical enrichment","We discuss a model for treating chemical enrichment by SNII and SNIa
explosions in simulations of cosmological structure formation. Our model
includes metal-dependent radiative cooling and star formation in dense
collapsed gas clumps. Metals are returned into the diffuse interstellar medium
by star particles using a local SPH smoothing kernel. A variety of chemical
abundance patterns in enriched gas arise in our treatment owing to the
different yields and lifetimes of SNII and SNIa progenitor stars. In the case
of SNII chemical production, we adopt metal-dependent yields. Because of the
sensitive dependence of cooling rates on metallicity, enrichment of galactic
haloes with metals can in principle significantly alter subsequent gas infall
and the build up of the stellar components. Indeed, in simulations of isolated
galaxies we find that a consistent treatment of metal-dependent cooling
produces 25% more stars outside the central region than simulations with a
primordial cooling function. In the highly-enriched central regions, the
evolution of baryons is however not affected by metal cooling, because here the
gas is always dense enough to cool. A similar situation is found in
cosmological simulations because we include no strong feedback processes which
could spread metals over large distances and mix them into unenriched diffuse
gas. We demonstrate this explicitly with test simulations which adopt
super-solar cooling functions leading to large changes both in the stellar mass
and in the metal distributions. We also find that the impact of metallicity on
the star formation histories of galaxies may depend on their particular
evolutionary history. Our results hence emphasise the importance of feedback
processes for interpreting the cosmic metal enrichment.",2005-05-20T14:47:47Z
"Smoothing Supernova Data to Reconstruct the Expansion History of the
  Universe and its Age","We propose a non-parametric method of smoothing supernova data over redshift
using a Gaussian kernel in order to reconstruct important cosmological
quantities including H(z) and w(z) in a model independent manner. This method
is shown to be successful in discriminating between different models of dark
energy when the quality of data is commensurate with that expected from the
future SuperNova Acceleration Probe (SNAP). We find that the Hubble parameter
is especially well-determined and useful for this purpose. The look back time
of the universe may also be determined to a very high degree of accuracy (\lleq
0.2 %) in this method. By refining the method, it is also possible to obtain
reasonable bounds on the equation of state of dark energy. We explore a new
diagnostic of dark energy-- the `w-probe'-- which can be calculated from the
first derivative of the data. We find that this diagnostic is reconstructed
extremely accurately for different reconstruction methods even if \Omega_m is
marginalized over. The w-probe can be used to successfully distinguish between
$\Lambda$CDM and other models of dark energy to a high degree of accuracy.",2005-05-16T20:01:52Z
Debris Disk Radiative Transfer Simulation Tool (DDS),"A WWW interface for the simulation of spectral energy distributions of

"The nature of the X-ray halo of the plerion G21.5-0.9 unveiled by
  XMM-Newton and Chandra","The nature of the radio-quiet X-ray halo around the plerionic SNR G21.5-0.9
is under debate. On the basis of spatial and spectral analysis of a large
Chandra and XMM-Newton dataset of this source, we have developed a
self-consistent scenario which explains all the observational features. We
found that the halo is composed by diffuse extended emission due to dust
scattering of X-rays from the plerion, by a bright limb which traces particle
acceleration in the fast forward shock of the remnant, and by a bright spot
(the ``North Spur'') which may be a knot of ejecta in adiabatic expansion. By
applying a model of interaction between the PWN, the SNR and supernova
environment, we argue that G21.5-0.9 progenitor may be of Type IIP or Ib/Ic,
and that the remnant may be young (200-1000 yr).",2005-07-21T17:59:58Z
Star Formation Histories of Local Group Dwarf Galaxies,"We report preliminary results of a project to homogeneously measure star
formation histories for the majority of Local Group dwarf galaxies, based on
archival WFPC2 observations. For the dwarf spheroidal and elliptical galaxies,
we find that the more luminous systems all show extended star formation
episodes, while the less luminous systems typically formed most of their stars
over ten Gyr ago. Irregular galaxies show no comparable trend. We find that a
galaxy's classification as an irregular or spheroidal is entirely explained by
its star formation within the past Gyr or less. Several elliptical/spheroidal
systems actively formed stars within the past two Gyr, and would have been
indistinguishable from present-day irregulars if observed two Gyr ago.",2005-06-17T22:11:24Z
"Measuring the primordial power spectrum: Principal component analysis of
  the cosmic microwave background","We implement and investigate a method for measuring departures from
scale-invariance, both scale-dependent as well as scale-free, in the primordial
power spectrum of density perturbations using cosmic microwave background (CMB)
C_l data and a principal component analysis technique. The primordial power
spectrum is decomposed into a dominant scale-invariant Gaussian adiabatic
component plus a series of orthonormal modes whose detailed form only depends
the noise model for a particular CMB experiment. However, in general these
modes are localised across wavenumbers with 0.01 < k < 0.2 Mpc^-1, displaying
rapid oscillations on scales corresponding the acoustic peaks where the
sensitivity to primordial power spectrum is greatest. The performance of this
method is assessed using simulated data for the Planck satellite, and the full
cosmological plus power spectrum parameter space is integrated out using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo. As a proof of concept we apply this data compression
technique to the current CMB data from WMAP, ACBAR, CBI and VSA. We find no
evidence for the breaking of scale-invariance from measurements of four PCA
mode amplitudes, which is translated to a constraint on the scalar spectral
index n_S(k_0=0.04 Mpc^-1)=0.94+-0.04 in accordance with WMAP studies.",2005-06-16T17:48:08Z
"Tracing large-scale structure at high redshift with Lyman-alpha
  emitters: the effect of peculiar velocities","We investigate the effect of peculiar velocities on the redshift space
distribution of z>~2 galaxies, and we focus in particular on Ly-alpha emitters.
We generate catalogues of dark matter (DM) halos and identify emitters with
halos of the same co-moving space density (M(Ly-alpha emitters) ~ 3x10^11
M_sun). We decompose the peculiar velocity field of halos into streaming,
gradient and random components, and compute and analyse these as a function of
scale. Streaming velocities are determined by fluctuations on very large
scales, strongly affected by sample variance, but have a modest impact on the
interpretation of observations. Gradient velocities are the most important as
they distort structures in redshift space, changing the thickness and
orientation of sheets and filaments. Random velocities are typically below or
of the same order as the typical observational uncertainty on the redshift. We
discuss the importance of these effects for the interpretation of data on the
large-scale structure as traced by Ly-alpha emitters (or similar kinds of
astrophysical high-redshift objects), focusing on the induced errors in the
viewing angles of filaments. We compare our predictions of velocity patterns
for Ly-alpha emitters to observations and find that redshift clumping of
Ly-alpha emitters, as reported for instance in the fields of high-redshift
radio galaxies, does not allow to infer whether an observed field is sampling
an early galaxy overdensity.",2005-05-23T16:05:35Z
"Correlations from Galactic foregrounds in the 1-year Wilkinson Microwave
  Anisotropy Probe WMAP data","We study a specific correlation in spherical harmonic multipole domain for
cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis. This group of correlation between
\Delta l=4n, n=1,2... is caused by symmetric signal in the Galactic coordinate
system. An estimator targeting such correlation therefore helps remove the
localized bright point-like sources in the Galactic plane and the strong
diffused component down to the CMB level. We use 3 toy models to illustrate the
significance of these correlations and apply this estimator on some derived CMB
maps with foreground residuals. In addition, we show that our proposed
estimator significantly damp the phase correlations caused by Galactic
foregrounds. This investigation provides the understanding of mode correlations
caused by Galactic foregrounds, which is useful for paving the way for
foreground cleaning methods for the CMB.",2005-06-20T18:06:50Z
Galactic Globular Cluster Relative Ages. II,"We present accurate relative ages for a sample of 55 Galactic globular
clusters. The ages have been obtained by measuring the difference between the
horizontal branch and the turnoff in two, internally photometrically
homogeneous databases. The mutual consistency of the two data sets has been
assessed by comparing the ages of 16 globular clusters in common between the
two databases. We have also investigated the consistency of our relative age
determination within the recent stellar model framework. All clusters with
[Fe/H]<-1.7 are found to be old, and coeval, with the possible exception of two
objects, which are marginally younger. The age dispersion for the metal poor
clusters is 0.6 Gyr (rms), consistent with a null age dispersion. Intermediate
metallicity clusters (-1.7<[Fe/H]<-0.8) are on average 1.5 Gyr younger than the
metal poor ones, with an age dispersion of 1.0 Gyr (rms), and a total age range
of ~3 Gyr. About 15% of the intermediate metallicity clusters are coeval with
the oldest clusters. All the clusters with [Fe/H]>-0.8 are ~1 Gyr younger than
the most metal poor ones, with a relatively small age dispersion, though the
metal rich sample is still too small to allow firmer conclusions. There is no
correlation of the cluster age with the Galactocentric distance. We briefly
discuss the implication of these observational results for the formation
history of the Galaxy.",2005-03-28T18:36:14Z
Introduction to Higher Order Spatial Statistics in Cosmology,"In this lecture notes I concentrate on the classic and widely applicable

"A Neutral Hydrogen Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud: Aperture
  Synthesis and Multibeam Data Combined","Using a Fourier-plane technique, we have merged HI ATCA and Parkes data sets
providing an accurate set of images of the LMC sensitive to structure on scales
of 15 pc (for an LMC distance of 55 kpc) upwards. The spatial dynamic range
(2.8 orders of magnitude), velocity resolution (1.649 km/s), brightness
temperature sensitivity (2.4 K) and column density sensitivity ($8.9 \times 10^
{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ per 1.649 km/s channel) allow for the studies of phenomena
ranging from the galaxy-wide interaction of the LMC with its close neighbours
to the small-scale injection of energy from supernovae and stellar associations
into the ISM of the LMC. We find that a previous analysis of the holes and
shells (Kim et al. 1999) in the HI distribution shows the same power- law
behavior with that of clumps. The measured perimeter P and measured enclosed
area A of each HI cloud in a log-log plot give us a set of points lying along
with a slope of D/2 = 0.73 $\pm$ 0.1. The relation between area and perimeter
of each identified HI cloud, P $\propto$ $A^{D/2}$, can determine the fractal
dimension D=1.47 $\pm$ 0.2 of a cloud boundary (Vogelaar & Wakker 1994;

the LMC is similar to the dimension, D=1.4, found in many studies of the
molecular ISM.",2005-06-10T02:17:00Z
Sulphur abundance in Galactic stars,"We investigate sulphur abundance in 74 Galactic stars by using high
resolution spectra obtained at ESO VLT and NTT telescopes. For the first time
the abundances are derived, where possible, from three optical multiplets:
Mult. 1, 6, and 8. By combining our own measurements with data in the
literature we assemble a sample of 253 stars in the metallicity range -3.2 <
[Fe/H] < +0.5. Two important features, which could hardly be detected in
smaller samples, are obvious from this large sample: 1) a sizeable scatter in
[S/Fe] ratios around [Fe/H] ~ -1 ; 2) at low metallicities we observe stars
with [S/Fe] ~ 0.4, as well as stars with higher [S/Fe] ratios. The latter do
not seem to be kinematically different from the former ones. Whether the latter
finding stems from a distinct population of metal-poor stars or simply from an
increased scatter in sulphur abundances remains an open question.",2005-07-01T14:58:26Z
"W Hya through the eye of Odin Satellite observations of circumstellar
  submillimetre H$_2$O line emission","We present Odin observations of the AGB star W Hya in the ground-state
transition of ortho-H2O, 1(10)-1(01), at 557GHz. The line is clearly of
circumstellar origin. Radiative transfer modelling of the water lines observed
by Odin and ISO results in a mass-loss rate of (2.5 +/- 0.5)E-7 Msol/yr, and a
circumstellar H2O abundance of (2.0 +/- 1.0)E-3. The inferred mass-loss rate is
consistent with that obtained from modelling the circumstellar CO radio line
emission, and also with that obtained from the dust emission modelling combined
with a dynamical model for the outflow. The very high water abundance, higher
than the cosmic oxygen abundance, can be explained by invoking an injection of
excess water from evaporating icy bodies in the system. The required extra mass
of water is quite small, on the order of ~ 0.1 earth mass.",2005-05-11T10:28:09Z
Integral Field Spectroscopy of 23 Spiral Bulges,"We have obtained Integral Field Spectroscopy for 23 spiral bulges using
INTEGRAL on the William Herschel Telescope and SPIRAL on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope. This is the first 2D survey directed solely at the bulges of spiral
galaxies. Eleven galaxies of the sample do not have previous measurements of
the stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*). These data are designed to complement
our Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph program for estimating black hole
masses in the range 10^6-10^8M_sun using gas kinematics from nucleated disks.
These observations will serve to derive the stellar dynamical bulge properties
using the traditional Mgb and CaII triplets. We use both Cross Correlation and
Maximum Penalized Likelihood to determine projected sigma* in these systems and
present radial velocity fields, major axis rotation curves, curves of growth
and sigma* fields. Using the Cross Correlation to extract the low order 2D
stellar dynamics we generally see coherent radial rotation and irregular
velocity dispersion fields suggesting that sigma* is a non-trivial parameter to
estimate.",2005-04-29T12:57:55Z
The Heated Core of the Radio-Quiet Galaxy Cluster A644,"We present an analysis of a Chandra ACIS-I observation of the massive galaxy
cluster A644. This cluster was previously classified as a cooling flow, but no
radio emission has been detected from its cD galaxy. Outside the core (R ~75
kpc ~0.03R_vir) the hot ICM has properties consistent with a (relaxed)
cool-core cluster out to the largest radii investigated (R ~415 kpc ~0.14
R_vir). Over this region the gravitating mass profile is described well by a
Navarro-Frenk-White profile with concentration parameter, c = 6.1 +/- 1.2, and
virial radius, R_vir = 2.9 +/- 0.4 Mpc. However, inside the core the
temperature and entropy profiles reverse their inward radial decline and rise
at the center; the inner temperature profile is inconsistent with a constant at
the 2.3 sigma level. Although the core region does not display X-ray cavities
or filamentary structures characteristic of radio-loud, cool-core clusters, the
peak of the X-ray emission is offset from that of the centroid of the global
X-ray halo by ~60 kpc. The position of the cD galaxy lies approximately between
the X-ray peak and centroid, further testifying to a merger origin for the
properties of the X-ray emission in the core. We discuss the implications of
A644 and the small number of radio-quiet, cool-core clusters for the AGN
feedback paradigm to suppress cooling flows in clusters.",2005-05-19T18:20:25Z
The Importance of Off-Axis Beaming in Jet Models,"Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are widely thought to originate from collimated jets
of material moving at relativistic velocities. Emission from such a jet should
be visible even when viewed from outside the angle of collimation. Using Monte
Carlo population synthesis methods and including the effects of this off-axis
beaming, we can compare various GRB jet models against the global properties of
observed bursts. We explore whether or not the X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) seen by
HETE-2 and BeppoSAX can be explained as classical GRBs viewed off-axis, and
begin to address the more general question of the importance of off-axis
beaming in current burst samples.",2005-05-08T16:55:56Z
"Asteroseismology of the Beta Cephei star Nu Eridani -- IV. The 2003-4
  multisite photometric campaign and the combined 2002-4 data","The second multisite photometric campaign devoted to Nu Eri is reported. For
Nu Eri, analysis of the new data adds four independent frequencies to the nine
derived previously from the 2002-3 data, three in the range from 7.20 to 7.93
c/d, and a low one, equal to 0.614 c/d. Combining the new and the old data
results in two further independent frequencies, equal to 6.7322 and 6.2236 c/d.
Altogether, the oscillation spectrum is shown to consist of 12 high frequencies
and two low ones. The latter have u amplitudes about twice as large as the v
and y amplitudes, a signature of high radial-order g modes. Thus, the
suggestion that Nu Eri is both a Beta Cephei and an SPB star, put forward on
the basis of the first campaign's data, is confirmed.
  Nine of the 12 high frequencies form three triplets, of which two are new.
The triplets represent rotationally split l=1 modes, although in case of the
smallest-amplitude one this may be questioned. Mean separations and asymmetries
of the triplets are derived with accuracy sufficient for meaningful comparison
with models.
  The first comparison star, Mu Eri, is shown to be an SPB variable with an
oscillation spectrum consisting of six frequencies, three of which are
equidistant in period. The star is also found to be an eclipsing variable. The
eclipse is a transit, probably total, the secondary is fainter than the primary
by several magnitudes, and the system is widely detached.
  The second comparison star, Xi Eri, is confirmed to be a Delta Scuti
variable. To the frequency of 10.8742 c/d seen already in the first campaign's
data, another one, equal to 17.2524 c/d, is added.",2005-04-11T12:27:03Z
Crossing of the w=-1 Barrier by D3-brane Dark Energy Model,"We explore a possibility for the Universe to cross the w=-1 cosmological
constant barrier for the dark energy state parameter. We consider the Universe
as a slowly decaying D3-brane. The D3-brane dynamics is approximately described
by a nonlocal string tachyon interaction and a back reaction of gravity is
incorporated in the closed string tachyon dynamics. In a local effective
approximation this model contains one phantom component and one usual field
with a simple polynomial interaction. To understand cosmological properties of
this system we study toy models with the same scalar fields but with modified
interactions. These modifications admit polynomial superpotentials. We find
restrictions on these interactions under which it is possible to reach w=-1
from below at large time. Explicit solutions with the dark energy state
parameter crossing/non-crossing the barrier w=-1 at large time are presented.",2005-07-04T13:05:47Z
"Cosmological parameters from CMB measurements and the final 2dFGRS power
  spectrum","We derive constraints on cosmological parameters using the power spectrum of
galaxy clustering measured from the final two-degree field galaxy redshift
survey (2dFGRS) and a compilation of measurements of the temperature power
spectrum and temperature-polarization cross-correlation of the cosmic microwave
background radiation. We analyse a range of parameter sets and priors, allowing
for massive neutrinos, curvature, tensors and general dark energy models. In
all cases, the combination of datasets tightens the constraints, with the most
dramatic improvements found for the density of dark matter and the
energy-density of dark energy. If we assume a flat universe, we find a matter
density parameter of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.237 \pm 0.020$, a baryon density
parameter of $\Omega_{\rm b} = 0.041 \pm 0.002$, a Hubble constant of
$H_{0}=74\pm2 {\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, a linear theory matter fluctuation
amplitude of $\sigma_{8}=0.77\pm0.05$ and a scalar spectral index of $n_{\rm
s}=0.954 \pm 0.023$ (all errors show the 68% interval). Our estimate of $n_{\rm
s}$ is only marginally consistent with the scale invariant value $n_{\rm s}=1$;
this spectrum is formally excluded at the 95% confidence level. However, the
detection of a tilt in the spectrum is sensitive to the choice of parameter
space. If we allow the equation of state of the dark energy to float, we find
$w_{\rm DE}= -0.85_{-0.17}^{+0.18}$, consistent with a cosmological constant.
We also place new limits on the mass fraction of massive neutrinos: $f_{\nu} <
0.105$ at the 95% level, corresponding to $\sum m_{\nu} < 1.2$ eV.",2005-07-26T12:43:49Z
"The trail of discrete X-ray sources in the early-type galaxy NGC4261:
  anisotropy in the globular cluster distribution?","Chandra images of the elliptical galaxy NGC4261 have revealed an anisotropy
in the spatial distribution of the off-nuclear X-ray sources, interpreted by
Zezas et al. as evidence of an association with a young stellar population. Our
independent analysis of archive X-ray (Chandra) and optical (INT and HST)
observations confirms the anisotropy of the X-ray sources but conducts to a
different interpretation for their origin. We find that nearly half of the
X-ray sources are associated to a globular cluster (optical counterpart)
suggesting that they are accreting low-mass X-ray binaries. Where color index
information is available, the X-ray sources are found to reside in red
(metal-rich) systems. The luminosity function of the X-ray sources is also
consistent with the one drawn from a population of Low Mass X-ray Binaries. We
further investigate the properties of the sample of point-like sources obtained
from archival optical images that we suggest are good globular cluster
candidates and for which we find that the projected spatial distribution is
non-homogeneous. In addition, we show that the distributions of the optical and
X-ray populations are very similar, which leads us to conclude that the spatial
anisotropy of the X-ray sources in NGC4261 is mostly a reflection of the
anisotropy of the globular cluster population.",2005-08-08T13:31:18Z
Hinting at primary composition using asymmetries in time distributions,"Evidence of azimuthal asymmetries in the time structure and signal size have
been found in non-vertical showers at the Pierre Auger Observatory. It has been
previously shown that the asymmetry in time distributions offers a new
possibility for the determination of the mass composition. New studies have
demonstrated that the dependence of the asymmetry parameter in the rise-time
and fall-time distributions with sec(theta) shows a clear peak. Both, the
position of the peak, X_asymax, and the size of the asymmetry at X_asymax are
sensitive to primary mass composition and have a small dependence on energy. In
this paper a study of the discriminating power of the new observables to
separate primary species is presented.",2005-07-07T14:47:01Z
"The Physical Natures of Class I and Flat-Spectrum Protostellar
  Photospheres: A Near-Infrared Spectroscopic Study","We present high resolution (R = 18,000), high signal-to-noise, 2 micron
spectra of 52 infrared-selected Class I and flat-spectrum young stellar objects
in the Taurus-Auriga, $\rho$ Ophiuchi, Serpens, Perseus, and Corona Australis
dark clouds. We detect key absorption lines in 41 objects and fit synthetic
spectra generated from pre-main sequence models to deduce the effective
temperatures, surface gravities, near-infrared veilings, rotation velocities,
and radial velocities of each of these 41 sources. We find these objects to
span ranges in effective temperature, surface gravity, and stellar luminosity
which appear similar to those of late spectral-type Class II sources and
classical T-Tauri stars. We determine that the mean 2 micron veiling of Class I
and flat-spectrum objects is significantly higher than that of Class II objects
in the same region where both types of objects are extensively observed ($\rho$
Oph). We find a significant fraction of our protostellar sample also exhibits
emission lines. Twenty-three objects show H$_2$ emission, usually indicative of
the presence of energetic outflows. Thirty-four sources show HI Br $\gamma$
emission and a number of these exhibit profile asymmetries consistent with
in-fall. Eight sources show significant $\Delta v = 2$ CO emission suggestive
of emission from a circumstellar disk. Overall, these observations indicate
that Class I and flat-spectrum objects are self-embedded protostars undergoing
significant mass accretion, although the objects appear to span a broad range
of mass accretion activity.",2005-05-13T18:53:55Z
Exploring the Hard X-/soft gamma-ray Continuum Spectra with Laue Lenses,"The history of X-ray astronomy has shown that any advancement in our
knowledge of the X-ray sky is strictly related to an increase in instrument
sensitivity. At energies above 60 keV, there are interesting prospects for
greatly improving the limiting sensitivity of the current generation of direct
viewing telescopes (with or without coded masks), offered by the use of Laue
lenses. We will discuss below the development status of a Hard X-Ray focusing
Telescope (HAXTEL) based on Laue lenses with a broad bandpass (from 60 to 600
keV) for the study of the X-ray continuum of celestial sources. We show two
examplesof multi-lens configurations with expected sensitivity orders of
magnitude better ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-8}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$
at 200 keV) than that achieved so far. With this unprecedented sensitivity,
very exciting astrophysical prospects are opened.",2005-07-07T15:44:57Z
Two extreme double-peaked line emitters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"Double-peaked Balmer lines have been observed in about 150 AGNs and were
interpreted preferably as emission from relativistic accretion disks. In this
paper, we report the discovery of extreme double-peaked lines in SDSS
J0942+0900 and SDSS J1417+6141. The FWHM of the Halpha line ~40,600 km/s in the
first object is almost twice as large as the broadest one previously known. By
comparing the line profile with accretion disk models, we find that most of the
line flux is emitted from a narrow annulus around 100Rg in SDSS J0942+0900, and
from a disk of radii between 100 and 400Rg in SDSS J1417+6141. This is the
first time that an accretion disk at radii below 100Rg can be directly probed
through optical emission lines. A certain asymmetry in the disk is required for
both objects. Another much weaker broad Halpha component (EW~20A, and FWHM
4000km/s) is also detected in both objects. Both objects show weak radio
emission and strong high-ionization narrow lines.",2005-04-14T11:01:34Z
"Absorption and scattering by interstellar dust: XMM-Newton observation
  of Cyg X-2","We present results of the XMM-Newton observation on the bright X-ray binary
Cyg X-2. In our analysis we focus upon the absorption and scattering of the
X-ray emission by interstellar dust. The scattering halo around Cyg X-2,
observed with the CCD detector EPIC-pn, is well detected up to ~7 arcmin and
contributes ~5-7% to the total source emission at 1 keV, depending on the dust
size distribution model considered. For the first time spatially resolved
spectroscopy of a scattering halo is performed. In the halo spectrum we clearly
detect the signature of the interstellar dust elements: O, Mg, and Si. The
spectral modeling of the halo shows a major contribution of silicates (olivine
and pyroxene). The spatial analysis of the halo shows that the dust is smoothly
distributed toward Cyg X-2 at least for ~60% of the path to the source. Within
the instrumental limits, the data do not show preference for a specific dust
size distribution; namely the Mathis, Rumpl & Nordsieck (1977) or the
Weingartner & Draine (2001) model. We used the Mie theory to compute the
differential scattering cross section. The RGS data were used to investigate
the ISM absorption, in particular the region of the oxygen edge. Combining the
RGS results with the information on dust grains provided by the EPIC-pn
spectrum of the halo we estimate a column density for dust absorption by
oxygen, provided that it is locked in silicate grains (abridged).",2005-08-04T13:11:05Z
"A FUSE Survey of Interstellar Molecular Hydrogen toward High-Latitude
  AGN","We report results from a FUSE survey of interstellar molecular hydrogen (H2)
along 45 sight lines to AGN at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 20 degrees). Most
(39 of 45) of the sight lines show detectable Galactic H2 absorption from Lyman
and Werner bands between 1000 and 1126 A, with column densities ranging from
N(H2) = 10^(14.17-19.82) cm^-2. In the northern Galactic hemisphere, we
identify many regions of low column, N(H2) < 10^15 cm^-2, between longitude l =
60-180 degrees and at b > 54 degrees. These `""H2 holes"" provide valuable,
uncontaminated sight lines for extragalactic UV spectroscopy, and a few may be
related to the ""Northern Chimney"" (low Na I absorption) and ""Lockman Hole"" with
low N(HI). A comparison of high-latitude H2 with 139 OB-star sight lines
surveyed in the Galactic disk suggests that high-latitude and disk H2 clouds
may have different rates of heating, cooling, and UV excitation. For rotational
states J = 0 and 1, the mean excitation temperature at high latitude,
<T_01(high)> = 124 +/- 8 K, is somewhat above that in the Galactic disk,
<T_01(disk)> = 86 +/- 20 K. For J = 2-4, the <T_exc> = 498 +/- 28 K, and the
column-density ratios, N(3)/N(1), N(4)/N(0), and N(4)/N(2), indicate a
comparable degree of UV excitation in the disk and low halo for sight lines
with N(H2) > 10^18. The distribution of molecular fractions at high latitude
shows a transition at lower total hydrogen column density, log N_H = 20.38 +/-
0.13, than in the Galactic disk, log N_H(disk) = 20.7. If the FUV radiation
fields are similar in disk and low halo, this suggests an enhanced
(dust-catalyzed) H2 formation rate in higher-density, compressed clouds, which
could be detectable as high-latitude, sheetlike infrared cirrus.",2005-07-25T19:50:08Z
Direct search for WIMP dark matter,"We will review the experimental aspects of the direct search for WIMP dark
matter. In thin search, one looks in a terrestrial target for nuclear recoils
produced by the impacts with WIMPs from the galatic halo. After describing the
different search strategies and review the currently running experiments and
the prospects of future experiments",2005-04-11T14:11:47Z
"Cosmological and astrophysical parameters from the SDSS flux power
  spectrum and hydrodynamical simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest","(abridged) The flux power spectrum of the Lyman-alpha forest in quasar (QSO)
absorption spectra is sensitive to a wide range of cosmological and
astrophysical parameters and instrumental effects. Modelling the flux power
spectrum in this large parameter space to an accuracy comparable to the
statistical uncertainty of large samples of QSO spectra is very challenging. We
use here a coarse grid of hydrodynamical simulations run with GADGET-2 to
obtain a ``best guess'' model around which we calculate a finer grid of flux
power spectra using a Taylor expansion of the flux power spectrum to first
order. We find that the SDSS flux power spectrum alone is able to constrain a
wide range of parameters including the amplitude of the matter power spectrum
sigma_8, the matter density Omega_m, the spectral index of primordial density
fluctuations n, the effective optical depth tau_eff and its evolution. The
thermal history of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) is, however, poorly
constrained and the SDSS data favour either an unplausibly large temperature or
an unplausibly steep temperature-density relation. By enforcing a thermal
history of the IGM consistent with that inferred from high-resolution QSO
spectra, we find the following values for the best fitting model (assuming a
flat Universe with a cosmological constant and zero neutrino mass): Omega_
m=0.28 \pm 0.03, n=0.95\pm0.04, \sigma_8=0.91\pm0.07 (1\sigma error bars).We
argue that the major uncertainties in this measurement are still systematic
rather than statistical.",2005-08-08T17:07:30Z
"Search for a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos with the NT200
  neutrino telescope","We present the results of a search for high energy extraterrestrial neutrinos
with the Baikal underwater Cherenkov detector NT200, based on data taken in
1998 - 2002 (1038 live days).Upper limits on the diffuse fluxes of
\nu_e+\nu_{\mu}+\nu_{\tau}, predicted by several models of AGN-like neutrino
sources, are derived. For an E^{-2} behavior of the neutrino spectrum, our
limit is E^2 \Phi_{\nu}(E)<8.1 10^{-7} cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1} GeV over a
neutrino energy range 2 10^4 - 5 10^7 GeV covering 90% of expected events. The

CN and HCN in Dense Interstellar Clouds,"We present a theoretical investigation of CN and HCN molecule formation in
dense interstellar clouds. We study the gas-phase CN and HCN production
efficiencies from the outer photon-dominated regions (PDRs) into the opaque
cosmic-ray dominated cores. We calculate the equilibrium densities of CN and
HCN, and of the associated species C+, C, and CO, as functions of the
far-ultraviolet (FUV) optical depth. We consider isothermal gas at 50 K, with
hydrogen particle densities from 10^2 to 10^6 cm^-3. We study clouds that are
exposed to FUV fields with intensities 20 to 2*10^5 times the mean interstellar
FUV intensity. We assume cosmic-ray H2 ionization rates ranging from 5*10^-17
s^-1, to an enhanced value of 5*10^-16 s^-1. We also examine the sensitivity of
the density profiles to the gas-phase sulfur abundance.",2005-06-22T14:59:39Z
"The orbital statistics of stellar inspiral and relaxation near a massive
  black hole: characterizing gravitational wave sources","We study the orbital parameters distribution of stars that are scattered into
nearly radial orbits and then spiral into a massive black hole (MBH) due to
dissipation, in particular by emission of gravitational waves (GW). This is
important for GW detection, e.g. by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA). Signal identification requires knowledge of the waveforms, which depend
on the orbital parameters. We use analytical and Monte Carlo methods to analyze
the interplay between GW dissipation and scattering in the presence of a mass
sink during the transition from the initial scattering-dominated phase to the
final dissipation-dominated phase of the inspiral. Our main results are (1)
Stars typically enter the GW-emitting phase with high eccentricities. (2) The
GW event rate per galaxy is a few per Gyr for typical central stellar cusps,
almost independently of the relaxation time or the MBH mass. (3) For
intermediate mass black holes (IBHs) of ~a thousand solar masses such as may
exist in dense stellar clusters, the orbits are very eccentric and the inspiral
is rapid, so the sources are very short-lived.",2005-03-30T21:01:04Z
"Black Hole Formation from Collapsing Dust Fluid in a Background of Dark
  Energy","The gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric star, made of a dust
fluid, $\rho_{DM}$, in a background of dark energy, $p = w\rho,\; (w < -1/3)$,
is studied. It is found that when only dark energy is present, black holes are
{\em never} formed. When both of them are present, black holes can be formed,
due to the condensation of the dust fluid. Initially the dust fluid may not
play an important role, but, as time increases, it will dominate the collapse
and finally leads to formation of black holes. This result remains true even
when the interaction between the dust fluid and dark energy does not vanish.
When $w < -1$ (phantoms), some models can also be interpreted as representing
the death of a white hole that ejects both dust and phantoms. The ejected
matter re-collapses to form a black hole.",2005-05-06T19:52:03Z
Low Order Aberrations in Band-Limited Lyot Coronagraphs,"We study the way Lyot coronagraphs with unapodized entrance pupils respond to
small, low order phase aberrations. This study is applicable to ground-based
adaptive optics coronagraphs operating at 90% and higher Strehl ratios, as well
as to some space-based coronagraphs with intrinsically higher Strehl ratio
imaging. We utilize a second order expansion of the monochromatic point-spread
function (written as a power spectrum of a power series in the phase aberration
over clear aperture) to derive analytical expressions for the response of a
`band-limited' Lyot coronagraph (BLC) to small, low order, phase aberrations.
The BLC possesses a focal plane mask with an occulting spot whose opacity
profile is a spatially band-limited function rather than a hard-edged, opaque
disk. The BLC is, to first order, insensitive to tilt and astigmatism.
Undersizing the stop in the re-imaged pupil plane (the Lyot plane) following
the focal plane mask can alleviate second order effects of astigmatism, at the
expense of system throughput and angular resolution. The optimal degree of such
undersizing depends on individual instrument designs and goals. Our analytical
work engenders physical insight, and complements existing numerical work on
this subject. Our methods can be extended to treat the passage of higher order
aberrations through band-limited Lyot coronagraphs, by using our polynomial
decomposition or an analogous Fourier approach.",2005-07-22T14:39:18Z
Neutrino-driven convection versus advection in core collapse supernovae,"A toy model is analyzed in order to evaluate the linear stability of the gain
region immediately behind a stalled accretion shock, after core bounce. This
model demonstrates that a negative entropy gradient is not sufficient to
warrant linear instability. The stability criterion is governed by the ratio
\chi of the advection time through the gain region divided by the local
timescale of buoyancy. The gain region is linearly stable if \chi< 3. The
classical convective instability is recovered in the limit \chi\gg 3. For
\chi>3, perturbations are unstable in a limited range of horizontal wavelengths
centered around twice the vertical size H of the gain region. The threshold
horizontal wavenumbers k_{min} and k_{max} follow simple scaling laws such that
Hk_{min}\propto 1/{\chi} and Hk_{max}\propto \chi. The convective stability of
the l=1 mode in spherical accretion is discussed, in relation with the
asymmetric explosion of core collapse supernovae. The advective stabilization
of long wavelength perturbations weakens the possible influence of convection
alone on a global l=1 mode.",2005-07-27T18:22:11Z
"Non-Gaussianity in the WMAP data using the peak-peak correlation
  function","We present a search for non-Gaussianity in the WMAP first-year data using the
two-point correlation function of maxima and minima in the temperature map. We
find evidence for non-Gaussianity on large scales, whose origin appears to be
associated with unsubstracted foregrounds, but which is not entirely clear. The
signal appears to be associated most strongly with cold spots, and is more
pronounced in the Southern galactic hemisphere. Removal of the region of sky
near the galactic plane, or filtering out large-scale modes removes the signal.
Analysis of individual frequency maps shows strongest signal in the 41GHz Q
band. A study of difference maps tests the hypothesis that the non-Gaussianity
is due to residual foregrounds and noise, but shows no significant detection.
We suggest that the detection is due to large-scale residual foregrounds
affecting more than one frequency band, but a primordial contribution from the
Cosmic Microwave Background cannot be excluded.",2005-07-05T13:34:01Z
"Gravoturbulent Star Formation: Effects of the Equation of State on
  Stellar Masses","Stars form by gravoturbulent fragmentation of interstellar gas clouds. The
supersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in Galactic molecular gas generates
strong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most
massive regions. Collapse sets in to build up stars and star clusters.
  Turbulence plays a dual role. On global scales it provides support, while at
the same time it can promote local collapse. Stellar birth is thus intimately
linked to the dynamic behavior of parental gas clouds, which governs when and
where protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass via
accretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. The equation
of state plays a pivotal role in the fragmentation process. Under typical cloud
conditions, massive stars form as part of dense clusters following the ""normal""
mass function observed, e.g. in the solar neighborhood. However, for gas with
an effective polytropic index greater than unity star formation becomes biased
towards isolated massive stars. This is relevant for understanding the
properties of zero-metallicity stars (Population III) or stars that form under
extreme environmental conditions like in the Galactic center or in luminous
starbursts.",2005-06-15T16:43:05Z
Constraints on the Orbital Evolution of Triton,"We present simulations of Triton's post-capture orbit that confirm the
importance of Kozai-type oscillations in its orbital elements. In the context
of the tidal orbital evolution model, these variations require average
pericenter distances much higher than previously published, and the timescale
for the tidal orbital evolution of Triton becomes longer than the age of the
Solar System. Recently-discovered irregular satellites present a new constraint
on Triton's orbital history. Our numerical integrations of test particles
indicate a timescale for Triton's orbital evolution to be less than $10^5$ yrs
for a reasonable number of distant satellites to survive Triton's passage. This
timescale is inconsistent with the exclusively tidal evolution (time scale of
$>10^8$ yrs), but consistent with the interestion with the debris from
satellite-satellite collisions. Any major regular satellites will quickly
collide among themselves after being perturbed by Triton, and the resulting
debris disk would eventually be swept up by Triton; given that the total mass
of the Uranian satellite system is 40% of that of Triton, large scale evolution
is possible. This scenario could have followed either collisional or the
recently-discussed three-body-interaction-based capture.",2005-05-11T21:15:15Z
The very young planetary nebula LS IV -12 111,"In the last few years we have started a systematic study aimed at detecting
very young Planetary Nebulae (YPNs). The project, based on both radio
(multi-frequency and high resolution) and optical observations, has already
provided interesting results, including the identification of new YPNs and the
observation, for the first time in PN in this very early phase of their
formation, of radio bipolar morphologies.
  In this paper we present radio and optical results on one of our targets,
namely IRAS 19590-1249 (LS IV -12 111). The analysis of spectroscopic
observations, obtained with the Anglo Australian Telescope (AAT) in different
epochs, has allowed us to conclude that the optical spectrum of this object has
evolved quite rapidly, showing, very recently, strong forbidden nebular
emission lines consistent with a young PN. This result confirms that IRAS
19590-1249, has turned into a PN within the last decades and makes this source
a perfect target for studying the early evolution and structure of Planetary
Nebulae.",2005-05-31T10:46:05Z
Properties of Central Caustics in Planetary Microlensing,"To maximize the number of planet detections, current microlensing follow-up
observations are focusing on high-magnification events which have a higher
chance of being perturbed by central caustics. In this paper, we investigate
the properties of central caustics and the perturbations induced by them. We
derive analytic expressions of the location, size, and shape of the central
caustic as a function of the star-planet separation, $s$, and the planet/star
mass ratio, $q$, under the planetary perturbative approximation and compare the
results with those based on numerical computations. While it has been known
that the size of the planetary caustic is \propto \sqrt{q}, we find from this
work that the dependence of the size of the central caustic on $q$ is linear,
i.e., \propto q, implying that the central caustic shrinks much more rapidly
with the decrease of $q$ compared to the planetary caustic. The central-caustic
size depends also on the star-planet separation. If the size of the caustic is
defined as the separation between the two cusps on the star-planet axis
(horizontal width), we find that the dependence of the central-caustic size on
the separation is \propto (s+1/s). While the size of the central caustic
depends both on $s$ and q, its shape defined as the vertical/horizontal width
ratio, R_c, is solely dependent on the planetary separation and we derive an
analytic relation between R_c and s. Due to the smaller size of the central
caustic combined with much more rapid decrease of its size with the decrease of
q, the effect of finite source size on the perturbation induced by the central
caustic is much more severe than the effect on the perturbation induced by the
planetary caustic. Abridged.",2005-05-18T06:35:05Z
"The 2dF QSO Redshift Survey - XV. Correlation analysis of redshift-Space
  distortions","We analyse the redshift-space (z-space) distortions of QSO clustering in the
2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ). To interpret the z-space correlation function,
xi(sigma,pi), we require an accurate model for the QSO real-space correlation
function, xi(r). Although a single power-law xi(r) model fits the projected
correlation function (wp(sigma)) at small scales, it implies somewhat too
shallow a slope for both wp(sigma) and the z-space correlation function, xi(s),
at larger scales > 20 h^(-1) Mpc. Motivated by the form for xi(r) seen in the
2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and in standard LCDM predictions, we use a
double power-law model for xi(r) which gives a good fit to xi(s) and wp(sigma).
The model is parametrized by a slope of gamma=1.45 for 1<r<10 h^(-1) Mpc and
gamma=2.30 for 10<r<40 h^(-1) Mpc. As found for 2dFGRS, the value of beta
determined from the ratio of xi(s)/xi(r) depends sensitively on the form of
xi(r) assumed. With our double power-law form for xi(r), we measure
beta(z=1.4)=0.32(+0.09)(-0.11). Assuming the same model for xi(r) we then
analyse the z-space distortions in the 2QZ xi(sigma,pi) and put constraints on
the values of Omega m and beta(z=1.4), using an improved version of the method
of Hoyle et al. The constraints we derive are Omega m=0.35(+0.19)(-0.13),
beta(z=1.4)=0.50(+0.13)(-0.15), in agreement with our xi(s)/\xi(r) results at
the ~1 sigma level.",2005-04-20T12:43:22Z
Superadiabatic-type magnetic amplification in conventional cosmology,"We consider the evolution of cosmological magnetic fields in FRW models and
outline a geometrical mechanism for their superadiabatic amplification on large
scales. The mechanism operates within standard electromagnetic theory and
applies to FRW universes with open spatial sections. We discuss the general
relativistic nature of the effect and show how it modifies the adiabatic
magnetic evolution. Assuming a universe that is only marginally open today, we
estimate the main features of the superadiabatically amplified residual field.",2005-04-05T16:54:41Z
"Late internal shock model for bright X-ray flares in Gamma-ray Burst
  afterglows and GRB 011121","We explore two possible models which might give rise to bright X-ray flares
in GRBs afterglows. One is an external forward-reverse shock model, in which
the shock parameters of forward/reverse shocks are taken to be quite different.
The other is a so called ""late internal shock model"", which requires a
refreshed unsteady relativistic outflow generated after the prompt $\gamma-$ray
emission. In the forward-reverse shock model, after the time $t_\times$ at
which the RS crosses the ejecta, the flux declines more slowly than
$(t_\oplus/t_\times)^{-(2+\beta)}$, where $t_\oplus$ denotes the observer's
time and $\beta$ is the spectral index of the X-ray emission. In the ``late
internal shock model"", decaying slopes much steeper than $(t_\oplus/t_{\rm e,
\oplus})^{-(2+\beta)}$ are possible if the central engine shuts down after
$t_{\rm e, \oplus}$ and the observed variability timescale of the X-ray flare
is much shorter than $t_{\rm e, \oplus}$.
  The sharp decline of the X-ray flares detected in GRB 011121, XRF 050406, GRB
050502b, and GRB 050730 rules out the external forward-reverse shock model
directly and favors the ""late internal shock model"". These X-ray flares could
thus hint that the central engine operates again and a new unsteady
relativistic outflow is generated just a few minutes after the intrinsic hard
burst.",2005-06-08T00:21:09Z
The Role of Magnetic Fields on Astrophysical Jets,"Highly collimated supersonic jets and less collimated outflows are observed
to emerge from a wide variety of astrophysical objects. They are seen in young
stellar objects (YSOs), proto-planetary nebulae, compact objects (such as
galactic black holes or microquasars, and X-ray binary stars), and in the
nuclei of active galaxies (AGNs). Despite their different physical scales (in
size, velocity, and amount of energy transported), they have strong
morphological similarities. What is the universal mechanism that can explain
their origin? In this lecture, I briefly review the role that magnetic fields
seem to play on the formation, structure, and propagation of these jets.",2005-05-25T22:19:50Z
A new reduction of the raw Hipparcos data,"We present an outline of a new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data,
the justifications of which are described in the accompanying paper. The
emphasis is on those aspects of the data analysis that are fundamentally
different from the ones used for the catalogue published in 1997. The new
reduction uses a dynamical modelling of the satellite's attitude. It
incorporates provisions for scan-phase discontinuities and hits, most of which
have now been identified. Solutions for the final along-scan attitude (the
reconstruction of the satellite's scan phase), the abscissa corrections and the
instrument model, originally solved simultaneously in the great-circle
solution, are now de-coupled. This is made possible by starting the solution
iterations with the astrometric data from the published catalogue. The
de-coupling removes instabilities that affected great-circle solutions for
short data sets in the published data. The modelling-noise reduction implies
smaller systematic errors, which is reflected in a reduction of the
abscissa-error correlations by about a factor 40. Special care is taken to
ensure that measurements from both fields of view contribute significantly to
the along-scan attitude solution. This improves the overall connectivity of the
data and rigidity of the reconstructed sky, which is of critical importance to
the reliability of the astrometric data. The changes in the reduction process
and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the satellite result in
considerable formal-error reductions for stars brighter than 8th magnitude.",2005-05-20T09:19:26Z
"On the temperature profile of radiatively efficient geometrically thin
  disks in black hole binaries with the ASCA GIS","X-ray spectra of black hole binaries(BHBs) in the high/soft state were
studied comprehensively by using ASCA GIS data, and partially RXTE PCA data. A
mathematical disk model was applied to several BHBs to see if the observed
accretion disk temperature profile was consistent with that expected from the
standard accretion disk model. This model is called p-free disk, and assumes
that the spectrum is composed of multi-temperature blackbody emission of which
the local temperature T(r) at radius r is given by T(r) ~ r^-p with p being a
positive free parameter. The standard disk roughly requires p~3/4, while a
small deviation is expected depending on the inner boundary conditions, general
relativistic effects and disk vertical structures.Our sample objects included
LMC X-1, LMC X-3, XTE J2012+381, and GRO J1655-40. During the ASCA
observations, these BHBs showed characteristics of the standard high/soft
state. Under the standard modeling of high-state black hole binaries, the
sources show Tin=0.76-1.17keV, the disk fraction to the total 0.7-10keV flux of
54-98%, and Nh=(0.7--12)E21/cm^2. The best-fit p-values were found in 0.6-0.8,
and the standard value of p=3/4 was accepted for all the sources.The obtained
p-values are also compared with those expected for the standard accretion disk
in the Schwarzschild metric, and they were consistent with those expected from
the standard accretion disk.",2005-05-17T02:47:48Z
Periodic variability and binary black hole systems in blazars,"We consider the periodic modulation of emission from jets in blazar-type
sources. A differential Doppler boosting origin, associated with the helical
motion of a radiating component, is analyzed for different periodic driving
sources including orbital motion and jet precession in a binary black hole
system (BBHS). We emphasize that for non-ballistic helical motion classical
travel time effects can lead to strong shortening effects, such that the
observed period may be a factor $\gamma_b^2$ smaller than the underlying
driving period, where $\gamma_b$ denotes the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet
flow. The relevance of the above noted scenarios is discussed for the BL Lac
object AO 0235+16.",2005-06-29T10:45:41Z
New neighbours VI. Spectroscopy of DENIS nearby stars candidates,"We present spectra of 36 nearby star candidates and 3 red giant candidates,
identified in the DENIS database by Phan-Bao et al. (2003). 32 of the dwarf
candidates are indeed nearby red dwarfs, with spectral types from M5.5 to M8.5.
Out of 11 targets with low proper motion (mu < 0.1$ arc-sec/yr) but a Reduced
Proper Motion above an inclusive threshold, 9 are red dwarfs. The 4
contaminants are all reddened F-K main sequence stars, and they could have been
eliminated by checking for some well known high latitude molecular clouds.
These stars might be of interest as probes of interstellar absorption. For the
red dwarfs we derive spectral types and spectroscopic distances, using a new
calibration of the PC3 spectral index to absolute magnitudes in the I, J, H and
K photometric bands.
  We confirm 2 new members of the 12 pc volume (2 new M8.5), and one M7.5 NLTT
object closer than 10pc. We also show that one quarter of the stars with
photometric distances under 30 pc have too small a proper motion for inclusion
in the NLTT catalog.",2005-06-16T02:42:36Z
"Properties of the diffuse X-ray background in a high-resolution
  hydrodynamical simulation","We study the properties of the diffuse X-ray background by using the results
of a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the concordance LambdaCDM model.
The simulation follows gravitational and gas dynamics and includes a treatment
of physical processes like radiative cooling, star formation and supernova
feedback. From the simulation outputs, we produce a set of two-dimensional maps
of the intergalactic medium X-ray emission integrated over redshift. We find
that the signal in the soft (0.5-2 keV) band is lognormally distributed with a
mean intensity of about 4 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 deg^-2; approximately 40 per
cent of the emission originates from warm-hot gas (defined as baryons with
10^5<T<10^7 K), and 90 per cent comes from structures at z<0.9. Since the
spectrum is soft, being mostly provided by the intergalactic medium at low
temperature, the total mean intensity in the hard (2-10 keV) X-ray band is
smaller by a factor of about 4. In order to constrain the physical processes
included in our simulation, we compare our results with the observed upper
limit (1.2 +/- 0.3) 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 deg^-2 of the soft X-ray emission due
to diffuse gas. To this purpose, we remove the contributions of observable
extended objects (groups and clusters of galaxies) from the simulated maps by
adopting different detectability criteria which are calibrated on the
properties of systems at intermediate redshifts observed by Chandra. We show
that the simulated diffuse soft X-ray emission is consistent with the present
observed upper limit. However, if future measurements will decrease the level
of the unresolved X-ray background by a factor of two, a more efficient
feedback mechanism should be required to suppress the soft emission of the gas
residing within filaments and group-size haloes.",2005-07-27T17:05:46Z
Determination of Cepheid parameters by light-curve template-fitting,"We describe techniques to characterise the light-curves of regular variable
stars by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to a training set of high
quality data, and to fit the resulting light-curve templates to sparse and
noisy photometry to obtain parameters such as periods, mean magnitudes etc. The
PCA approach allows us to efficiently represent the multi-band light-curve
shapes of each variable, and hence quantitatively describe the average
behaviour of the sample as a smoothly varying function of period, and also the
range of variation around this average.
  In this paper we focus particularly on the utility of such methods for
analysing HST Cepheid photometry, and present simulations which illustrate the
advantages of our PCA template-fitting approach. These are: accurate parameter
determination, including light-curve shape information; simultaneous fitting to
multiple passbands; quantitative error analysis; objective rejection of
variables with non Cepheid-like light-curves or those with potential period
aliases.
  We also use PCA to confirm that Cepheid light-curve shapes are systematically
different (at the same period) between the Milky Way (MW) and the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC), and consider whether light-curve shape
might therefore be used to estimate the mean metallicities of Cepheid samples,
thus allowing metallicity corrections to be applied to derived distance
estimates.",2005-04-19T07:24:42Z
Emission line variability of RS Ophiuchi,"We report that the H_alpha emission line of RS Oph was strongly variable
during our 2004 observations on a time scale of 1 month. The line consisted of
both a double peaked central narrow component (FWHM ~ 220 km/s) and a strongly
variable broad one (FWHM ~ 2000 km/s). The base of the H_alpha line was very
broad with FWZI 4600 km/s on all spectra from 1986 to 2004. The variability of
the broad component extends from -2000 to +2000 km/s. Most probably this is due
to either blobs ejected from the white dwarf (with a typical blob mass
estimated to be ~10^{-10} M_solar or a variable accretion disk wind.
  We also detected variability of the HeII4686 line on a time scale shorter
than 1 day. The possible origin is discussed.",2005-06-15T09:17:58Z
VLA observations of broad 6-cm excited state OH lines in W49A,"Using the Very Large Array (VLA), we observed all three of the 6-cm lines of
the doublet Pi 1/2, J=1/2 state of OH with sub-arcsecond resolution (about 0.4
arcsec) in W49A. While the spatial distribution and the range in velocities of
the 6-cm lines are similar to those of the ground state (18-cm) OH lines, a
large fraction of the total emission in all three 6-cm lines has large
linewidths (about 5 -- 10 km/s) and is spatially-extended, very unlike typical
ground state OH masers which typically are point-like at VLA resolutions and
have linewidths less than 1 km/s. We find brightness temperatures of 5900 K,
4700 K, and greater than 730 K for the 4660-MHz, 4750-MHz, and 4765-MHz lines,
respectively. We conclude that these are indeed maser lines. However, the gains
are about 0.3, again very unlike the 18-cm lines which have gains greater than
10000. We compare the excited state OH emission with that from other molecules
observed with comparable angular resolution to estimate physical conditions in
the regions emitting the peculiar, low-gain maser lines. We also comment on the
relationship with the 18-cm masers",2005-04-05T16:43:16Z
"The Monopole Moment of the Three-Point Correlation Function of the
  2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey","We measure the monopole moment of the three-point correlation function on
scales $1\mpc-70\mpc$ in the Two degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS).
Volume limited samples are constructed using a series of integral magnitudes
bins between $M = -18 ... -22$. Our measurements with a novel edge-corrected
estimator represent most, if not all, three-point level monopole or angular
averaged information in the catalogue. We fit a perturbative non-linear bias
model to a joint data vector formed from the estimated two- and three-point
correlation functions. Two different models are used: an analytic model based
on Eulerian perturbation theory including bias and redshift distortions, and a
phenomenological bias model based on the direct redshift space measurements in
the large Virgo simulations. To interpret the clustering results, we perform a
three parameter Gaussian maximum likelihood analysis. In the canonical $-21
\sim -20$ volume limited sample we find $\sigma_8 = 0.93^{+0.06}_{-0.2}$, $b =
1.04^{+0.23}_{-0.09}$, and $b_2 = -0.06^{+0.003}_{-0.001}$. Our estimate of
$\sigma_8$, is robust across the different volume limited samples constructed.
These results, based solely on the large scale clustering of galaxies, are in
excellent agreement with previous analyses using the Wilkinson Anisotropy
Probe: this is a spectacular success of the concordance model. We also present
two-parameter fits for the bias parameters, which are in excellent agreement
with previous findings of the bias evolution in the 2dFGRS.",2005-05-19T21:00:46Z
Cosmological black holes as voids progenitors. I. Simulations,"Cosmological black holes (CBH), i.e. black holes with masses larger than
$10^{14} solar masses, have been proposed as possible progenitors of galaxy
voids (Stornaiolo 2002). The presence of a CBH in the central regions of a void
should induce significant gravitational lensing effects and in this paper we
discuss such gravitational signatures using simulated data. These signatures
may be summarized as follows: i) a blind spot in the projected position of the
CBH where no objects can be detected; ii) an excess of faint secondary images;
iii) an excess of double images having a characteristic angular separation. All
these signatures are shown to be detectable in future deep surveys.",2005-07-19T11:58:05Z
"On the role of injection in kinetic approaches to nonlinear particle
  acceleration at non relativistic shocks","The dynamical reaction of the particles accelerated at a shock front by the
first order Fermi process can be determined within kinetic models that account
for both the hydrodynamics of the shocked fluid and the transport of the
accelerated particles. These models predict the appearance of multiple
solutions, all physically allowed. We discuss here the role of injection in
selecting the {\it real} solution, in the framework of a simple
phenomenological recipe, which is a variation of what is sometimes referred to
as {\it thermal leakage}. In this context we show that multiple solutions
basically disappear and when they are present they are limited to rather
peculiar values of the parameters.",2005-07-29T12:56:15Z
Secular Evolution in Mira Variable Pulsations,"Stellar evolution theory predicts that asymptotic giant branch stars undergo
a series of short thermal pulses that significantly change their luminosity and
mass on timescales of hundreds to thousands of years. Secular changes in these
stars resulting from thermal pulses can be detected as measurable changes in
period if the star is undergoing Mira pulsations. The American Association of
Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) International Database currently contains
visual data for over 1500 Mira variables. Light curves for these stars span
nearly a century in some cases, making it possible to study the secular
evolution of the pulsation behavior on these timescales. In this paper, we
present the results of our study of period change in 547 Mira variables using
data from the AAVSO. We find non-zero rates of period change, dlnP/dt, at the
2-sigma significance level in 57 of the 547 stars, at the 3-sigma level in 21
stars, and at the level of 6-sigma or greater in eight of the 547. The latter
eight stars have been previously noted in the literature, and our derived rates
of period changes largely agree with published values. The largest and most
statistically significant dlnP/dt are consistent with the rates of period
change expected during thermal pulses on the AGB. A number of other stars
exhibit non-monotonic period changes on decades-long timescales, the cause of
which is not yet known.",2005-04-24T13:11:52Z
Galactic and Cosmic Chemical Evolution with Hypernovae,"We provide new nucleosynthesis yields depending on metallicity and energy
(i.e., (normal supernovae and hypernovae), and show the evolution of heavy
element abundances from C to Zn in the solar neighborhood. We then show the
chemodynamical simulation of the Milky Way Galaxy and discuss the G-dwarf
problem. We finally show the cosmological simulation and discuss the galaxy
formation and chemical enrichment.",2005-08-09T17:19:37Z
Neutron Diffusion and Nucleosynthesis in an Inhomogeneous Big Bang Model,"This article presents an original code for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in a
baryon inhomogeneous model of the universe. In this code neutron diffusion
between high and low baryon density regions is calculated simultaneously with
the nuclear reactions and weak decays that compose the nucleosynthesis process.
The size of the model determines the time when neutron diffusion becomes
significant. This article describes in detail how the time of neutron diffusion
relative to the time of nucleosynthesis affects the final abundances of He4,
deuterium and Li7. These results will be compared with the most recent
observational constraints of He4, deuterium and Li7. This inhomogeneous model
has He4 and deuterium constraints in concordance for baryon to photon ratio eta
= (4.3 - 12.3) X 10^{-10} Li7 constraints are brought into concordance with the
other isotope constraints by including a depletion factor as high as 5.9. These
ranges for the baryon to photon ratio and for the depletion factor are larger
than the ranges from a Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis model.",2005-06-16T01:23:40Z
Hot Cores : Probes of High-Redshift Galaxies,"The very high rates of second generation star formation detected and inferred
in high redshift objects should be accompanied by intense millimetre-wave
emission from hot core molecules. We calculate the molecular abundances likely
to arise in hot cores associated with massive star formation at high redshift,
using several independent models of metallicity in the early Universe. If the
number of hot cores exceeds that in the Milky Way Galaxy by a factor of at
least one thousand, then a wide range of molecules in high redshift hot cores
should have detectable emission. It should be possible to distinguish between
independent models for the production of metals and hence hot core molecules
should be useful probes of star formation at high redshift.",2005-04-01T22:38:20Z
"Accretion Disks, Jets and Blazar Variability","Although blazar variability is probably dominated by emission from
relativistic jets, accretion disks should be present in all blazars. These
disks produce emission over most of the electromagnetic spectrum; various
unstable processes operate in those disks which lead to variable emission. Here
I summarize some of the most relevant disk mechanisms for AGN variability. I
also discuss some aspects of jet variability, focusing on the possibility that
ultrarelativisitic jets of modest opening angle can reconcile TeV blazar
emission with the many subluminal VLBI knots seen in those sources. Finally, I
present recently illuminated characteristics of optical microvariability of
different classes of AGN which have important implications for the dominant
processes involved.",2005-07-06T17:44:56Z
"Generalised 3D-reconstruction method of a dipole anisotropy in
  cosmic-ray distributions","We develop a method to study the anisotropy of a cosmic-ray angular
distribution, using both the right ascension and the declination of the arrival
directions. It generalises the full-sky coverage method of Sommers (2001) to
partial-sky coverage experiments. When the angular distribution consists of a
dipolar modulation of an otherwise isotropic flux, the method allows one to
reconstruct the dipole amplitude and the dipole orientation in 3D space. We
analyse in detail the statistical properties of the method, introducing the
concept of reconstruction power, and show that it is generally more powerful
than the standard Rayleigh analysis in right ascension. We clarify the link
between the traditionally-used first harmonic amplitude and the true, physical
dipole amplitude, and we investigate the variation of the reconstruction powers
as a function of the dipole orientation. We illustrate the method by computing
the amplitude and angular reconstruction powers of the Pierre Auger
Observatory, with the Southern site alone and with both Southern and Northern
sites. In this particular case, we find that the building of a similar site in
the Northern hemisphere would decrease the time needed for the method to reveal
a significant departure from an isotropic cosmic-ray distribution by a factor
of about eight.",2005-04-26T16:24:18Z
"Quasi-periodic Oscillations in the X-ray Light Curves from Relativistic
  Tori","We use a relativistic ray-tracing code to analyze the X-ray emission from a
pressure-supported oscillating relativistic torus around a black hole. We show
that a strong correlation exists between the {\it intrinsic} frequencies of the
torus normal modes and the {\it extrinsic} frequencies seen in the observed
light curve power spectrum. This correlation demonstrates the feasibility of
the oscillating-torus model to explain the multiple peaks seen in black hole
high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations. Using an optically thin,
monochromatic emission model, we also determine how a relativistically
broadened emission line and the amplitude of the X-ray modulations are
dependent on the observer's inclination angle and on the torus oscillation
amplitudes. Observations of these features can provide important information
about the torus as well as the black hole.",2005-06-28T16:14:45Z
"Dust outflows and inner gaps generated by massive planets in debris
  disks","Main sequence stars are commonly surrounded by debris disks, formed by cold
far-IR-emitting dust that is thought to be continuously replenished by a
reservoir of undetected dust-producing planetesimals. We have investigated the
orbital evolution of dust particles in debris disks harboring massive planets.
Small dust grains are blown out by radiation pressure, as is well known; in
addition, gravitational scattering by the giant planets also creates an outflow
of large grains. We describe the characteristics of this large-particle outflow
in different planetary architectures and for different particle sizes. In
addition, the ejection of particles is responsible for the clearing of dust
inside the orbit of the planet. We study the efficiency of particle ejection
and the resulting dust density contrast inside and outside the orbit of the
planet, as a function of the planet's mass and orbital elements and the
particle size. We discuss its implications for exo-planetary debris disks and
for the interpretation of in-situ dust detection experiments on space probes
traveling in the outer solar system.",2005-06-27T21:38:11Z
A High Resolution Mosaic of Molecular Gas in Stephan's Quintet,"We present high resolution CO J=1-0 observations of the molecular gas in the
Hickson Compact Group Stephan's Quintet (HCG92). Our observations consist of
multiple pointing and mosaics covering all the regions where CO and star
formation has been detected. Within the 100'' field of view centered on the
eastern-most tidal tail, we detect three clumps of emission that may be
partially resolved at our resolution of 8''; two of these are new detections
not previously seen in ISM studies of this region. Two of these clumps lie in
the optical tidal tail, while the third lies to the southeast and is coincident
with a large HI feature, but does not correspond to any features at other
wavelengths. We also tentatively detect CO emission from the star forming
regions in the ``Old Tail'' corresponding to recent star formation activity
detected in recent UV and H$\alpha$ observations. Observations of the rest of
the compact group do not show detections even though strong emission was
detected with single dish telescopes, which suggests the CO emission originates
from a diffuse molecular gas cloud or from more at least three separate clumps
with separations of greater than around 3 kpc.",2005-08-03T22:11:43Z
"Molecular gas and continuum emission in 3C48: Evidence for two merger
  nuclei?","We present new interferometer observations of the CO(1-0) line and mm
continuum emission from 3C48 - one of the nearest examples of a merger
activating a quasar. Our new CO data show that most of the CO is not in a disk
around the quasar 3C48, but rather in a second nucleus associated with the
source 3C48A ~1"" to the north-east, recently studied in the near-IR by Zuther
et al. (2004). This main CO source has a strong velocity gradient (140km/s over
about 1""). Our new data also show a second, weaker CO source at the QSO itself.
At 1.2mm, the continuum emission is elongated in the direction of the radio jet
and towards 3C48A. We model the 1.2mm continuum with three different sources in
3C48 - the 3C48 QSO, the 3C48 jet, and the second nucleus 3C48A. We suggest
that the unusually bright and extended nature of the jet may be due to its
interaction with the second merger nucleus 3C48A.",2005-05-09T08:35:20Z
The Fine Structure Lines of Hydrogen in HII Regions,"The 2s_{1/2} state of hydrogen is metastable and overpopulated in HII
regions. In addition, the 2p states may be pumped by ambient Lyman-alpha
radiation. Fine structure transitions between these states may be observable in
HII regions at 1.1 GHz (2s_{1/2}-2p_{1/2}) and/or 9.9 GHz (2s_{1/2}-2p_{3/2}),
although the details of absorption versus emission are determined by the
relative populations of the 2s and 2p states. The n=2 level populations are
solved with a parameterization that allows for Lyman-alpha pumping of the 2p
states. The density of Lyman-alpha photons is set by their creation rate,
easily determined from the recombination rate, and their removal rate. Here we
suggest that the dominant removal mechanism of Lyman-alpha radiation in HII
regions is absorption by dust. This circumvents the need to solve the
Lyman-alpha transfer problem, and provides an upper limit to the rate at which
the 2p states are populated by Lyman-alpha photons. In virtually all cases of
interest, the 2p states are predominantly populated by recombination, rather
than Lyman-alpha pumping. We then solve the radiative transfer problem for the
fine structure lines in the presence of free-free radiation. In the likely
absence of Lyman-alpha pumping, the 2s_{1/2}-2p_{1/2} lines will appear in
stimulated emission and the 2s_{1/2}-2p_{3/2} lines in absorption. Searching
for the 9.9 GHz lines in high emission measure HII regions offers the best
prospects for detection. The lines are predicted to be weak; in the best cases,
line-to-continuum ratios of several tenths of a percent might be expected with
line strengths of tens to a hundred mK with the Green Bank Telescope.",2005-05-21T00:53:42Z
A unified model for black hole X-ray binary jets ?,"We have recently put forward a 'unified' semi-empirical model for the
coupling between accretion and jet production in galactic black hole X-ray
binaries (published in MNRAS, 2004). In this paper we summarise this model and
briefly discuss relevant considerations which have arisen since its
publication.",2005-06-20T20:10:40Z
On the Submillimeter Opacity of Protoplanetary Disks,"Solid particles with the composition of interstellar dust and power-law size
distribution dn/da propto a^{-p} for a < a_max with a_{max} > 3 lambda and 3 <
p < 4 will have submm opacity spectral index beta(lambda) = dln(kappa)/dln(nu)
approx (p-3) beta_{ism}, where beta_{ism} approx 1.7 is the opacity spectral
index of interstellar dust material in the Rayleigh limit. For the power-law
index p approx 3.5 that characterizes interstellar dust, and that appears
likely for particles growing by agglomeration in protoplanetary disks, grain
growth to sizes a > 3 mm will result in beta(1 mm) < ~1. Grain growth can
naturally account for beta approx 1 observed for protoplanetary disks, provided
that a_{max} > ~ 3 lambda.",2005-07-12T16:10:05Z
The X-ray Ridge Surrounding Sgr A* at the Galactic Center,"We present the first detailed simulation of the interaction between the
supernova explosion that produced Sgr A East and the wind-swept inner ~ 2-pc
region at the Galactic center. The passage of the supernova ejecta through this
medium produces an X-ray ridge ~ 9'' to 15'' to the NE of the supermassive
black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We show that the morphology and X-ray
intensity of this feature match very well with recently obtained Chandra
images, and we infer a supernova remnant age of less than 2,000 years. This
young age--a factor 3--4 lower than previous estimates--arises from our
inclusion of stellar wind effects in the initial (pre-explosion) conditions in
the medium. The supernova does not clear out the central ~ 0.2-pc region around
Sgr~A* and does not significantly alter the accretion rate onto the central
black hole upon passage through the Galactic center.",2005-06-10T19:33:16Z
Soft coincidence in late acceleration,"We study the coincidence problem of late cosmic acceleration by assuming that
the present ratio between dark matter and dark energy is a slowly varying
function of the scale factor. As dark energy component we consider two
different candidates, first a quintessence scalar field, and then a tachyon
field. In either cases analytical solutions for the scale factor, the field and
the potential are derived. Both models show a good fit to the recent
magnitude-redshift supernovae data. However, the likelihood contours disfavor
the tachyon field model as it seems to prefer a excessively high value for the
matter component.",2005-06-21T09:44:03Z
Issues with Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitor Models,"The status of core collapse supernoova progenitor models is reviewed with a
focus on some of the current uncertainties arising from the difficulties of
modeling important macrophysics and microphysics. In particular, I look at
issues concerned with modeling convection, the implications of the still
uncertain 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate, the uncertainties involved with
the incorporation of mass loss, rotation, and magnetic fields in the stellar
models, and the possible generation of global instabilities in stellar models
at the late evolutionary stages.",2005-06-14T16:42:51Z
"An Investigation of Diffuse Interstellar Gas toward a Large, Low
  Extinction Window into the Inner Galaxy","Halpha and Hbeta spectroscopy with the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM)
reveals a strong concentration of high velocity emission in a ~ 5 by 5 deg area
centered near (l.b) = (27,-3), known as the Scutum Cloud. The high velocities
imply that we are detecting optical emission from near the plane of the Galaxy
out to the tangent point at heliocentric distances of D \gtrsim 6 kpc, assuming
the gas participates in circular Galactic rotation. The ratio of the Halpha to
Hbeta emission as a function of velocity suggests that dust along these lines
of sight produces a total visual extinction of A_v ~ 3 at D ~ 6 kpc. This makes
it possible to use optical emission lines to explore the physical conditions of
ionized gas in the inner Galaxy. At a Galactocentric distance R_G ~ 4 kpc, for
example, we find that the H^+ has an rms midplane density of ~ 1 cm^-3 with a
vertical scale height of ~ 300 pc. We also find evidence for an increase in the
flux of Lyman continuum photons and an increase in the ratio of ionized to
neutral hydrogen toward the inner Galaxy. We have extended the measurements of
E(B-V) in this direction to distances far beyond what has been accessible
through stellar photometry and find E(B-V)/N_H to be near the local mean of 1.7
x 10^-22 cm^2 mag, with evidence for an increase in this ratio at R_G ~ 4 kpc.
Finally, our observations of [NII] 6583, [SII] 6716, and [OIII] 5007 toward the
window reveal that in the inner Galaxy the temperature of the gas and the
ionization state of oxygen increase with increasing height from the midplane.",2005-05-24T05:50:47Z
"Formation of Galactic Systems in Light of the Magnesium Abundance in
  Field Stars: The Thick Disk","The space velocities and Galactic orbital elements of stars calculated from
the currently available high-accuracy observations in our summary catalog of
spectroscopic magnesium abundances in dwarfs and subgiants in the solar
neighborhood are used to identify thick-disk objects. The relative magnesium
abundances in thick-disk stars are shown to lie within the range
0.0<[Mg/Fe]<0.5 and to decrease with increasing metallicity starting from
[Fe/H]=-1.0. This is interpreted as evidence for a longer duration of the star
formation process in the thick disk. We have found vertical gradients in
metallicity (grad_Z[Fe/H]=-0.13\pm 0.04 kpc^{-1}) and relative magnesium
abundance (grad_Z [Mg/Fe]=0.06\pm 0.02 kpc^{-1}), which can be present in the
subsystem only in the case of its formation in a slowly collapsing protogalaxy.
The large spread in relative magnesium abundance (-0.3<[Mg/Fe]<0.5) in the
stars of the metal-poor ""tail"" of the thick disk which constitute 8% of the
subsystem, can be explained in terms of their formation inside isolated
interstellar clouds that interacted weakly with the matter of a single
protogalactic cloud. We have found a statistically significant negative radial
gradient in relative magnesium abundance in the thick disk (grad_R
[Mg/Fe]=-0.03\pm 0.01 kpc^{-1}) instead of the expected positive gradient. The
smaller perigalactic orbital radii and the higher eccentricities for
magnesium-richer stars, which among other stars, are currently located in a
small volume of the Galactic space near the Sun are assumed to be responsible
for the gradient inversion. A similar but statistically less significant
inversion is also observed in the subsystem for the radial metallicity
gradient.",2005-07-06T13:51:34Z
Black Hole Shadows of Charged Spinning Black Holes,"We propose a method for measuring the black hole charge by imaging a black
hole shadow in a galactic center by future interferometers. Even when the black
hole is uncharged, it is possible to confirm the charge neutrality by this
method. We first derive the analytic formulae of the black hole shadow in an
optically thin medium around a charged spinning black hole, and then
investigate how contours of the black hole shadow depend on the spin and the
charge of the black hole for several inclination angles between the rotation
axis of the black hole and the observer. This method only assumes stationary
black hole and general relativity. By fitting the formula of the contours of
the shadow to the observed image of the shadow, in addition to the black hole
charge, one can also determine the black hole spin and the inclination angle
without any degeneracy among the charge, the spin, and the inclination angle
unless the inclination angle is null.",2005-05-16T07:42:08Z
"Subaru Super Deep Field with Adaptive Optics I. Observations and First
  Implications","We present a deep $K^{\prime}$-band (2.12$\mu$m) imaging of 1\arcmin\
$\times$ 1\arcmin Subaru Super Deep Field (SSDF) taken with the Subaru adaptive
optics (AO) system. Total integration time of 26.8 hours results in the
limiting magnitude of $K^{\prime} \sim 24.7$ (5$\sigma$, 0\farcs2 aperture) for
point sources and $K^{\prime} \sim 23.5$ (5$\sigma$, 0\farcs6 aperture) for
galaxies, which is the deepest limit ever achieved in the $K^{\prime}$ band.
The average stellar FWHM of the co-added image is 0\farcs18. Based on the
photometric measurements of detected galaxies, we obtained the differential
galaxy number counts, for the first time, down to $K^{\prime} \sim 25$, which
is more than 0.5 mag deeper than the previous data. We found that the number
count slope $d\log N/dm$ is about 0.15 at $22 < K^{\prime} < 25$, which is
flatter than the previous data. Therefore, detected galaxies in the SSDF have
only negligible contribution to the near-infrared extragalactic background
light (EBL), and the discrepancy claimed so far between the diffuse EBL
measurements and the estimated EBL from galaxy count integration has become
more serious . The size distribution of detected galaxies was obtained down to
the area size of less than 0.1 arcsec$^2$, which is less than a half of the
previous data in the $K^{\prime}$ band. We compared the observed size-magnitude
relation with a simple pure luminosity evolution model allowing for intrinsic
size evolution, and found that a model with no size evolution gives the best
fit to the data. It implies that the surface brightness of galaxies at high
redshift is not much different from that expected from the size-luminosity
relation of present-day galaxies.",2005-05-17T15:12:42Z
"The Stellar Content of Nearby Star-Forming Galaxies. III. Unravelling
  the Nature of the Diffuse Ultraviolet Light","We investigate the nature of the diffuse intra-cluster ultraviolet light seen
in twelve local starburst galaxies, using long-slit ultraviolet spectroscopy
obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST). We take this faint intra-cluster light to be the field
in each galaxy, and compare its spectroscopic signature with STARBURST99
evolutionary synthesis models and with neighboring star clusters. Our main
result is that the diffuse ultraviolet light in eleven of the twelve starbursts
lacks the strong O-star wind features that are clearly visible in spectra of
luminous clusters in the same galaxies. The difference in stellar features
dominating cluster and field spectra indicate that the field light originates
primarily from a different stellar population, and not from scattering of UV
photons leaking out of the massive clusters. We consider several scenarios to
understand the lack of observed O stars in the field, and their implications
for the origin of the field stellar population. If the field stellar
populations formed in situ, the field must either have an IMF which is steeper
than Salpeter (3.0-3.5) or a Salpeter slope with an upper mass cutoff of 30-50
solar masses. If star formation occurs primarily in star clusters, the field
could be composed of older, faded clusters, and/or a population which is coeval
with the luminous clusters but lower in mass. If the field is composed of
older, dissolving clusters, we estimate that star clusters (regardless of mass)
need to dissolve on timescales 7-10 Myr to create the field (abridged).",2005-05-02T14:13:45Z
"A boxy bulge in the Milky Way. Inversion of the stellar statistics
  equation with 2MASS data","Inverting the stellar statistics equation from 2MASS star counts, we obtain
the 3D density distribution of the Galactic bulge as well as its luminosity
function in the K-band. This results in a boxy bulge with axial ratios
1:0.5:0.4 and a major axis angle with respect to the Sun-galactic center of
$20^\circ-35^\circ $.",2005-04-27T17:47:58Z
A New Version of Reimers' law of Mass Loss Based on a Physical Approach,"We present a new semi-empirical relation for the mass loss of cool stellar
winds, which so far has frequently been described by ""Reimers' law"".
Originally, this relation was based solely on dimensional scaling arguments
without any physical interpretation. In our approach, the wind is assumed to
result from the spill-over of the extended chromosphere, possibly associated
with the action of waves, especially Alfven waves, which are used as guidance
in the derivation of the new formula. We obtain a relation akin to the original
Reimers law, but which includes two new factors. They reflect how the
chromospheric height depends on gravity and how the mechanical energy flux
depends, mainly, on effective temperature. The new relation is tested and
sensitively calibrated by modelling the blue end of the Horizontal Branch of
globular clusters. The most significant difference from mass loss rates
predicted by the Reimers relation is an increase by up to a factor of 3 for
luminous late-type (super-)giants, in good agreement with observations.",2005-07-26T11:58:22Z
How to identify the youngest protostars,"We study the transition from a prestellar core to a Class 0 protostar, using
SPH to simulate the dynamical evolution, and a Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code to generate the SED and isophotal maps. For a prestellar core illuminated
by the standard interstellar radiation field, the luminosity is low and the SED
peaks at ~190 micron. Once a protostar has formed, the luminosity rises (due to
a growing contribution from accretion onto the protostar) and the peak of the
SED shifts to shorter wavelengths (~80-100 micron). However, by the end of the
Class 0 phase, the accretion rate is falling, the luminosity has decreased, and
the peak of the SED shifts back towards longer wavelengths (90-150 micron). In
our simulations, the density of material around the protostar remains
sufficiently high well into the Class 0 phase that the protostar only becomes
visible in the NIR if it is displaced from the centre dynamically. Raw submm/mm
maps of Class 0 protostars tend to be much more centrally condensed than those
of prestellar cores. However, when convolved with a typical telescope beam, the
difference in central concentration is less marked, although the Class 0
protostars appear more circular. Our results suggest that, if a core is deemed
to be prestellar on the basis of having no associated IRAS source, no cm radio
emission, and no outflow, but it has a circular appearance and an SED which
peaks at wavelengths below ~170 micron, it may well contain a very young Class
0 protostar.",2005-05-13T15:46:48Z
Astrometric Discovery of GJ 802b: In the Brown Dwarf Oasis?,"The Stellar Planet Survey is an ongoing astrometric search for giant planets
and brown dwarfs around a sample of about 30 M-dwarfs. We have discovered
several low-mass companions by measuring the motion of our target stars
relative to their reference frames. The lowest mass discovery thus far is GJ
802b, a companion to the M5-dwarf GJ 802A. The orbital period is 3.14 +/- 0.03
y, the system mass is 0.214 +/- 0.045 Msolar, and the semi-major axis is 1.28
+/- 0.10 AU or 81 +/- 6 mas. Imaging observations indicate that GJ 802b is
likely to be a brown dwarf with the astrometrically determined mass 0.058 +/-
0.021 Msolar (one sigma limits). The remaining uncertainty in the orbit is the
eccentricity that is now loosely constrained. We discuss how the system age
limits the mass and the prospects to further narrow the mass range when e is
more precisely determined.",2005-05-10T18:01:26Z
A CO Survey of Young Planetary Nebulae,"We report the results of a sensitive survey of young planetary nebulae in the
CO J=2-1 line that significantly increases the available data on warm, dense,
molecular gas in the early phases of planetary nebula formation. The
observations were made using the IRAM 30 m telescope with the 3 by 3 pixel
Heterodyne Receiver Array (HERA). The array provides an effective means of
discriminating the CO emission of planetary nebulae in the galactic plane from
contaminating emission of interstellar clouds along the line of sight. 110
planetary nebulae were observed in the survey and 40 were detected. The results
increase the number of young planetary nebulae with known CO emission by
approximately a factor of two. The CO spectra yield radial velocities for the
detected nebulae, about half of which have uncertain or no velocity
measurements at optical wavelengths. The CO profiles range from parabolic to
double-peaked, tracing the evolution of structure in the molecular gas. The
line widths are significantly larger than on the Asymptotic Giant Branch, and
many of the lines show extended wings, which probably result from the effects
on the envelopes of high velocity jets.",2005-06-03T22:31:21Z
"The Oxford-Dartmouth Thirty Degree Survey II: Clustering of Bright Lyman
  Break Galaxies - Strong Luminosity Dependent Bias at z=4","We present measurements of the clustering properties of bright ($L>L_{*}$)
z$\sim$4 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) selected from the Oxford-Dartmouth Thirty
Degree Survey (ODT). We describe techniques used to select and evaluate our
candidates and calculate the angular correlation function which we find best
fitted by a power law, $\omega(\theta)=A_{w}\theta^{-\beta}$ with $A_{w}=15.4$
(with $\theta$ in arcseconds), using a constrained slope of $\beta=0.8$. Using
a redshift distribution consistent with photometric models, we deproject this
correlation function and find a comoving $r_{0}=11.4_{-1.9}^{+1.7}$
h$_{100}^{-1}$ Mpc in a $\Omega_m=0.3$ flat $\Lambda$ cosmology for
$i_{AB}\leq24.5$. This corresponds to a linear bias value of
$b=8.1_{-2.6}^{+2.0}$ (assuming $\sigma_{8}=0.9$). These data show a
significantly larger $r_{0}$ and $b$ than previous studies at $z\sim4$. We
interpret this as evidence that the brightest LBGs have a larger bias than
fainter ones, indicating a strong luminosity dependence for the measured bias
of an LBG sample. Comparing this against recent results in the literature at
fainter (sub-$L_{*}$) limiting magnitudes, and with simple models describing
the relationship between LBGs and dark matter haloes, we discuss the
implications on the implied environments and nature of LBGs. It seems that the
brightest LBGs (in contrast with the majority sub-$L_{*}$ population), have
clustering properties, and host dark matter halo masses, that are consistent
with them being progenitors of the most massive galaxies today.",2005-05-02T09:17:10Z
Late-time Inhomogeneity and Acceleration Without Dark Energy,"The inhomogeneous distribution of matter in the non-linear regime of
galaxies, clusters of galaxies and voids is described by an exact, spherically
symmetric inhomogeneous solution of Einstein's gravitational field equations,
corresponding to an under-dense void. The solution becomes the homogeneous and
isotropic Einstein-de Sitter solution for a red shift $z > 10-20$, which
describes the matter dominated CMB data with small inhomogeneities
$\delta\rho/\rho\sim 10^{-5}$. A spatial volume averaging of physical
quantities is introduced and the averaged time evolution expansion parameter
$\theta$ in the Raychoudhuri equation can give rise in the late-time universe
to a volume averaged deceleration parameter $<q>$ that is negative for a
positive matter density. This allows for a region of accelerated expansion
which does not require a negative pressure dark energy or a cosmological
constant. A negative deceleration parameter can be derived by this volume
averaging procedure from the Lema\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi open void solution,
which describes the late-time non-linear regime associated with galaxies and
under-dense voids and solves the ``coincidence'' problem.",2005-05-16T16:20:45Z
"Point-like gamma ray sources as signatures of distant accelerators of
  ultra high energy cosmic rays","We discuss the possibility of observing distant accelerators of ultra high
energy cosmic rays in synchrotron gamma rays. Protons propagating away from
their acceleration sites produce extremely energetic electrons during
photo-pion interactions with cosmic microwave background photons. If the
accelerator is embedded in a magnetized region, these electrons will emit high
energy synchrotron radiation. The resulting synchrotron source is expected to
be point-like and detectable in the GeV-TeV energy range if the magnetic field
is at the nanoGauss level.",2005-05-22T14:44:33Z
"Mass-loss and Recent Spectral Changes in the Yellow Hypergiant Rho
  Cassiopeiae","The yellow hypergiant Rho Cassiopeiae (F-G Ia0) has recently become very
active with a tremendous outburst event in the fall of 2000. During the event
the pulsating supergiant dimmed by more than a visual magnitude, while its
effective temperature decreased from 7000 K to below 4000 K over about 200 d,
and we directly observed the largest mass-loss rate of about 5% of the solar
mass in a single stellar outburst so far. Over the past three years since the
eruption we observed a very prominent inverse P Cygni profile in Balmer H
alpha, signaling a strong collapse of the upper atmosphere, also observed
before the 2000 event. Continuous spectroscopic monitoring reveals that the H
alpha line profile has transformed into a P Cygni profile since June 2003,
presently (Sept 2004) signaling supersonic expansion velocities up to ~120 km/s
in the extended upper atmosphere.
  Based on the very recent unique spectral evolution we observed the far-UV
spectrum with the FUSE satellite in July 2004. The FUSE spectrum reveals that
high-temperature plasma emission lines of O VI and C III are absent in the
hypergiant, also observed for the red supergiant Alpha Ori (M2 Iab). On the
other hand, we observe prominent transition region emission lines in the
smaller (less luminous) classical Cepheid variable Beta Dor (F-G Iab-Ia),
indicating that the mean atmospheric extension and surface gravity acceleration
(as compared to effective temperature and atmospheric pulsation) play a major
role for the formation of high-temperature stellar atmospheric plasmas. We
present an overview of the recent spectral variability phases of Rho Cas with
enhanced mass-loss from this enigmatic cool star.",2005-04-24T01:54:24Z
"Thermal evolution and activity of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 and simulation of a
  deep impact","We use a quasi 3-D thermal evolution model for a spherical comet nucleus,
which takes into account the diurnal and latitudinal variation of the solar
flux, but neglects lateral heat conduction. We model the thermal evolution and
activity of Comet 9P/Tempel 1, in anticipation of the Deep Impact mission
encounter with the comet. We also investigate the possible outcome of a
projectile impact, assuming that all the energy is absorbed as thermal energy.
An interesting result of this investigation, is that the estimated amount of
dust ejected due to the impact is equivalent to 2--2.6 days of activity, during
""quiet"" conditions, at perihelion.
  We show that production rates of volatiles that are released in the interior
of the nucleus depend strongly on the porous structure, in particular on the
surface to volume ratio of the pores. We develop a more accurate model for
calculating this parameter, based on a distribution of pore sizes, rather than
a single, average pore size.",2005-07-01T19:35:09Z
"Spectral Indications of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in Archeops
  and WMAP Data","In this paper, we present a joint cross-correlation analysis of the Archeops
CMB maps at 143 and 217 GHz and the WMAP CMB maps at 41, 61 and 94 GHz with sky
templates of projected galaxy density constructed from the 2MASS Extended
Source catalog. These templates have been divided in patches sorted in
decreasing galaxy density with a fixed number of pixels (we considered patches
having 32, 64 and 128 pixels) and the cross correlation has been performed
independently for each of these patches. We find that the densest patch shows a
strong temperature decrement in the Q, V, W bands of WMAP and in the 143 GHz
channel of Archeops, but not in the 217 GHz channel. Furthermore, we find that
the spectral behavior of the amplitude of this decrement is compatible with
that expected for the non-relativistic thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and
is incompatible (at 4.5 sigma level) with the null hypothesis of having only
CMB, noise and a dust component (nu^2) in those pixels. We find that the first
32-pixel sized patch samples the cores of 11 known massive nearby galaxy
clusters. Under the assumption that the decrement found in this patch is due
entirely to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, we obtain an average
comptonization parameter for those sources of y = (0.41 +- 0.08) x 10^(-4) at
13 arcmin angular scales. This value is compatible at 1 sigma with the
expectation, y = 0.49 x 10^(-4), from a model of the cluster flux number counts
based on the standard Lambda-CDM cosmology. The observed value of y is slightly
diluted when computed for the first patch of 64 and 128 pixels, presumably due
to the inclusion of less massive clusters, and the dilution factor inferred is
also compatible with the quoted model.",2005-06-22T10:10:11Z
"The 2MASS Wide-Field T Dwarf Search. IV Unting out T dwarfs with Methane
  Imaging","We present first results from a major program of methane filter photometry
for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The definition of a new methane filter
photometric system is described. A recipe is provided for the differential
calibration of methane imaging data using existing 2MASS photometry. We show
that these filters are effective in discriminating T dwarfs from other types of
stars, and demonstrate this with Anglo-Australian Telescope observations using
the IRIS2 imager. Methane imaging data and proper motions are presented for ten
T dwarfs identified as part of the 2MASS ""Wide Field T Dwarf Search"" -- seven
of them initially identified as T dwarfs using methane imaging.
  We also present near-infrared moderate resolution spectra for five T dwarfs,
newly discovered by this technique. Spectral types obtained from these spectra
are compared to those derived from both our methane filter observations, and
spectral types derived by other observers. Finally, we suggest a range of
future programs to which these filters are clearly well suited: the winnowing
of T dwarf and Y dwarf candidate objects coming from the next generation of
near-infrared sky surveys; the robust detection of candidate planetary-mass
brown dwarfs in clusters; the detection of T dwarf companions to known L and T
dwarfs via deep methane imaging; and the search for rotationally-modulated
time-variable surface features on cool brown dwarfs.",2005-08-05T08:06:57Z
Caustic and Weak Lensing Estimators of Galaxy Cluster Masses,"There are only two methods for estimating the mass distribution in the outer
regions of galaxy clusters, where virial equilibrium does not hold: weak
gravitational lensing and identification of caustics in redshift space. For the
first time, we apply both methods to three clusters: A2390, MS1358 and Cl 0024.
The two measures are in remarkably good agreement out to ~2 Mpc/h from the
cluster centers. This result demonstrates that the caustic technique is a
valuable complement to weak lensing. With a few tens of redshifts per (Mpc/h)^2
within the cluster, the caustic method is applicable for any z<~0.5.",2005-06-23T14:23:38Z
"Quality studies of the data taking conditions for the Auger Fluorescence
  Detector","As more than half of the Fluorescence Detector (FD) of the Auger Observatory
is completed, data taking is becoming a routine job. It is then necessary to
follow strict procedures to assure the quality of the data. An overview of the
data taking methods is given. The nature of the FD background signal is due to
the night sky brightness (stars and planet faint light, moonlight, twilight,
airglow, zodiacal and artificial light) and to the electronic background
(photomultiplier and electronic noise). The analysis of the fluctuations in the
FADC signal (variance analysis), directly proportional to the background mean
light level, performed for each night of data taking is used to monitor the FD
background signal. The data quality is analysed using different techniques,
described in detail. Examples of trigger rates, number of stereo events, dead
time due to moonlight, weather or hardware problems are given. The analysis
comprises several months of data taking, giving an overview of the FD
capabilities, performance and allowing a systematic study of data and their
correlation with the environment.",2005-07-06T13:02:14Z
"Constraints on the dense matter EOS from the measurements of PSR

will soon be measurable through detailed measurements of the periastron
advance. We present the calculation of the moment of inertia of neutron stars
with the masses of the components of the binary J0737-3039 for a broad range of
equations of state of dense matter and discuss the implications of such
measurement for constraining the equation of state. An observational
determination of the moment of inertia of the pulsar A in J0737-3039 with the
accuracy of 10% shall narrow down considerably the range of viable equations of
state. We also show that limits on maximal mass of a neutron star provide a
complementary set of constraints on the properties of dense nuclear matter.",2005-08-03T13:06:48Z
"Formation of Population III Stars in Fossil HII Regions: Significance of
  HD","We study the evolution of gas in HII regions around the first stars after the
death of the exciting stars. If the first star in a small halo dies without
supernova (SN), subsequent star formation is possible in the same halo. We thus
investigate the effect of ionization of the gas on subsequent star formation
within small halos in the early universe using one-dimensional hydrodynamics
with spherical symmetry along with non-equilibrium primordial gas chemistry. We
find that the enhanced electron fraction facilitates the formation of molecular
hydrogen at the cores of these halos. The low temperature circumstances
produced by the H_2 cooling is suitable for HD formation and the resultant
cooling further drops the temperature below 100 K. Consequently, low-mass stars
with primordial abundances can form even in a small halo. After accreting the
interstellar metals, these stars might resemble low-mass ultra metal-poor stars
discovered in the present Galactic halo.",2005-05-30T15:31:27Z
"Application of an Equilibrium Vaporization Model to the Ablation of
  Chondritic and Achondritic Meteoroids","We modeled equilibrium vaporization of chondritic and achondritic materials
using the MAGMA code. We calculated both instantaneous and integrated element
abundances of Na, Mg, Ca, Al, Fe, Si, Ti, and K in chondritic and achondritic
meteors. Our results are qualitatively consistent with observations of meteor
spectra.",2005-06-01T20:33:26Z
Observational Tests of Intergalactic Enrichment Models,"We summarize recent results assessing the carbon and silicon abundances of
the intergalactic medium (IGM) using the `pixel optical depth' technique. We
briefly discuss the implications of these results for models of intergalactic
enrichment, focusing on distinguishing `early' z >> 4 enrichment by the first
generations of stars and objects from `late' enrichment by 2 < z < 5 Ly-break
galaxies. We then discuss the comparison of observed QSO spectra to simulated
spectra generated from cosmological simulations that self-consistently include
enrichment, and draw qualitative implications for the general picture of
intergalactic enrichment at z > 2.",2005-04-19T23:19:02Z
The [O III] Veil: Astropause of Eta Carinae's Wind?,"We present narrowband images of eta Carinae in the light of [O III] 5007
obtained with HST/WFPC2, as well as a ground-based image in the same emission
line with a larger field of view. These images show a thin veil of [O III]
emission around eta Car and its ejecta, confirming the existence of an
oxygen-bearing ``cocoon'' inferred from spectra. This [O III] veil may be the
remnant of the pre-outburst wind of eta Car, and its outer edge probably marks
the interface where eta Car's ejecta meet the stellar wind of the nearby O4
V((f)) star HD303308 or other ambient material -- i.e., it marks the
``astropause'' in eta Car's wind. This veil is part of a more extensive [O III]
shell that appears to be shaped and ionized by HD303308. A pair of HST images
with a 10 yr baseline shows no proper motion, limiting the expansion speed away
from eta Car to 12pm13 km/s, or an expansion age of a few times 10^4 yr. Thus,
this is probably the decelerated pre-outburst LBV wind of eta Car. The [O III]
morphology is very different from that seen in [N II], which traces young knots
of CNO-processed material; this represents a dramatic shift in the chemical
makeup of material recently ejected by eta Car. This change in the chemical
abundances may have resulted from the sudden removal of the star's outer
envelope during eta Car's 19th century outburst or an earlier but similar
event.",2005-07-07T23:10:32Z
A Phoenix Modelatmosphere Grid For GAIA,"We present the results of a set of model atmospheres and synthetic spectra
computed with the PHOENIX code. The models cover a range of effective
temperatures 2700 K <= T_eff <= 10 000 K, gravities (-0.5 <= log(g)<= 5.5) and
metalicities (-4.0 <= [Z/H] <= +0.5). In addition, variations of alpha elements
are considered for each metalicity. The models are computed with a homogeneous
set of input data in order to allow for direct relative comparison between the
models. For example, all models use a mixing length of l/H_p = 2.0. We provide
synthetic spectra with a resolution of 0.2 nm from the UV to the infrared for
all models. We give a brief overview of the input physics and show illustrative
results. All synthetic spectra are available via ftp:

High-energetic Cosmic Antiprotons from Kaluza-Klein Dark Matter,"The lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP) in models with universal extra
dimensions is an interesting dark matter candidate that has recently received
great attention. Here, we investigate the antiproton flux from LKP
annihilations in the galactic halo. In our analysis we include different halo
density profiles and allow for part of the dark matter to be concentrated in
'clumps' rather than being distributed homogeneously. After re-analyzing the
observational bounds on the allowed amount of clumpiness, we find that LKP
annihilations may well give a significant contribution to the antiproton flux
at energies higher than about 10 GeV, while for energies above around 500 GeV
the conventional background is expected to dominate again. The shortly upcoming
PAMELA satellite will already be able to measure part of this high-energy
window, while planned experiments like AMS-02 will have access to the full
energy range of interest.",2005-06-09T22:05:01Z
Time-Delayed transfer functions simulations for LMXBs,"Recent works (Steeghs & Casares 2002, Casares et al. 2003, Hynes et al. 2003)
have demonstrated that Bowen flourescence is a very efficient tracer of the
companion star in LMXBs. We present a numerical code to simulate time-delayed
transfer functions in LMXBs, specific to the case of reprocessing in emission
lines. The code is also able to obtain geometrical and binary parameters by
fitting observed (X-ray + optical) light curves using simulated annealing
methods. In this work we present the geometrical model for the companion star
and the analytical model for the disc and show synthetic time-delay transfer
functions for different orbital phases and system parameters.",2005-07-04T12:06:20Z
Bars and Cold Dark Matter Halos,"The central part of a dark matter halo reacts to the presence and evolution
of a bar. Not only does the halo absorb angular momentum from the disk, it can
also be compressed and have its shape modified. We study these issues in a
series of cosmologically motivated, highly resolved N-body simulations of
barred galaxies run under different initial conditions. In all models we find
that the inner halo's central density increases. We model this density increase
using the standard adiabatic approximation and the modified formula by Gnedin
et al. and find that halo mass profiles are better reproduced by this latter.
In models with a strong bar, the dark matter in the central region forms a
bar-like structure (``dark matter bar''), which rotates together with the
normal bar formed by the stellar component (``stellar bar''). The
minor-to-major axial ratio of a halo bar changes with radius with a typical
value 0.7 in the central disk region. DM bar amplitude is mostly a function of
the stellar bar strength. Models in which the bar amplitude increases or stays
roughly constant with time, initially large (40%-60%) misalignment between the
halo and disk bars quickly decreases with time as the bar grows. The halo bar
is nearly aligned with the stellar bar (~10 degrees lag for the halo) after ~2
Gyr. The torque, which the halo bar exerts on the stellar bar, can serve as a
mechanism to regulate the angular momentum transfer from the disk to the halo.",2005-06-26T23:05:07Z
Limits on the primordial stellar multiplicity,"Most stars - especially young stars - are observed to be in multiple systems.
Dynamical evolution is unable to pair stars efficiently, which leads to the
conclusion that star-forming cores must usually fragment into \geq 2 stars.
However, the dynamical decay of systems with \geq 3 or 4 stars would result in
a large single-star population that is not seen in the young stellar
population. Additionally, ejections would produce a significant population of
hard binaries that are not observed. This leads to a strong constraint on star
formation theories that cores must typically produce only 2 or 3 stars. This
conclusion is in sharp disagreement with the results of currently available
numerical simulations that follow the fragmentation of molecular cores and
typically predict the formation of 5--10 seeds per core. In addition, open
cluster remnants may account for the majority of observed highly hierarchical
higher-order multiple systems in the field.",2005-05-23T11:25:58Z
Curvature driven acceleration : a utopia or a reality ?,"The present work shows that a combination of nonlinear contribution from the
Ricci curvature in Einstein field equations can drive a late time acceleration
of expansion of the universe. The transit from the decelerated to the
accelerated phase of expansion takes place smoothly without having to resort to
a study of asymptotic behaviour. This result emphasizes the need for thorough
and critical examination of models with nonlinear contribution from the
curvature.",2005-05-05T12:32:31Z
"Probing the IGM-Galaxy Connection Toward PKS0405-123 II : A
  Cross-Correlation Study of Lya Absorbers and Galaxies at z<0.5","We present a pilot study of the clustering properties of Lya absorbers with
respect to known galaxies based on 112 Lya absorbers and 482 galaxies
identified at z<0.5 along the sightline toward PKS0405-123. The principal goal
is to determine the origin of Lya absorbers based on their cross-correlation
amplitude with known galaxies and investigate a possible N(HI) dependence of
the cross-correlation function. The main results of our study are as follows.
(1) The cross-correlation function xi_{ga} measured using only emission-line
dominated galaxies and Lya absorbers of log N(HI) >= 14 shows a comparable
strength to the galaxy auto-correlation function xi_{gg} on co-moving,
projection distance scales < 1 h^{-1} Mpc, while there remains a lack of
cross-correlation signal when using only absorption-line dominated galaxies.
This signifies a morphology-dependent xi_{ga} and indicates that strong
absorbers of log N(HI) >= 14 and emission-line galaxies reside in the same halo
population. (2) A maximum-likelihood analysis shows that Lya absorbers of log
N(HI) < 13.6 are consistent with being more randomly distributed with respect
to known galaxies. Finally, (3) we find based on this single sightline that the
amplitude of xi_{ga} does not depend sensitively on N(HI) for strong absorbers
of log N(HI) >= 13.6.",2005-07-26T20:03:03Z
"Gravitino, Axino, Kaluza-Klein Graviton Warm and Mixed Dark Matter and
  Reionisation","Stable particle dark matter may well originate during the decay of long-lived
relic particles, as recently extensively examined in the cases of the axino,
gravitino, and higher-dimensional Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton. It is shown that
in much of the viable parameter space such dark matter emerges naturally
warm/hot or mixed. In particular, decay produced gravitinos (KK-gravitons) may
only be considered cold for the mass of the decaying particle in the several
TeV range, unless the decaying particle and the dark matter particle are almost
degenerate. Such dark matter candidates are thus subject to a host of
cosmological constraints on warm and mixed dark matter, such as limits from a
proper reionisation of the Universe, the Lyman-alpha forest, and the abundance
of clusters of galaxies.. It is shown that constraints from an early
reionsation epoch, such as indicated by recent observations, may potentially
limit such warm/hot components to contribute only a very small fraction to the
dark matter.",2005-08-04T17:27:53Z
Neutrinos from Supernovas and Supernova Remnants,"Supernovae (SN) and supernova remnants (SNR) have key roles in galaxies, but
their physical descriptions is still incomplete. Thus, it is of interest to
study neutrino radiation to understand SN and SNR better. We will discuss: (1)
The ~10 MeV thermal neutrinos that arise from core collapse SN, that were
observed for SN1987A, and can be seen with several existing or planned
experiments. (2) The 10-100 TeV neutrinos expected from galactic SNR (in
particular from RX J1713.7-3946) targets of future underwater neutrino
telescopes.",2005-08-05T10:19:47Z
Evolving turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters,"We discuss, using simple analytical models and MHD simulations, the origin
and parameters of turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Three
physically distinct regimes can be identified in the evolution of cluster
turbulence and magnetic fields. Firstly, the fluctuation dynamo will produce
microgauss-strong, random magnetic fields during cluster formation and major
mergers. Turbulent velocity of about 300 km/s can be maintained at scales
100-200 kpc. The magnetic field is intermittent, has a smaller scale of 20-30
kpc and average strength of 2 microgauss. Secondly, when major mergers end,
turbulent speed and magnetic field undergo a power-law decay, decreasing in
strength but increasing in scale by a factor of about two. Thirdly,
smaller-mass subclusters and cluster galaxies produce turbulent wakes, with
turbulent speeds and magnetic field strengths similar to those quoted above.
The velocity scales are about 200 kpc and 10 kpc respectively, and the magnetic
field scale is about 6 times smaller. Although these wakes may fill only a
small fraction of the cluster volume, their area covering factor can be close
to unity. So one can potentially reconcile observations that indicate the
coexistence of turbulence with ordered filamentary gas structures, as in the
Perseus cluster. Random Faraday rotation measure is estimated to be typically
100-200 rad/m^2, in agreement with observations. We predict detectable
synchrotron polarization from cluster radio halos at wavelengths 3-6 cm, if
observed at sufficiently high resolution (abridged).",2005-05-07T18:07:23Z
"Curious Variables Experiment (CURVE). CCD Photometry of Dwarf Nova V660
  Herculis","We report extensive photometry of the dwarf nova V660 Herculis. During our
campaign, lasting from August 2003 to November 2004, we recorded one bright
eruption which turned out to be a superoutburst lasting about 15 days and
having amplitude of ~4.5 mag. Clear superhumps with a mean period of Psh =
0.080924(18) days were present during all nights of the superoutburst. The
period of the superhumps was not stable and in the interval covered by our
observations it decreased with a rate of -4.0(1.4) * 10^{-5}.
  Basing on our data and the known orbital period of the binary (Thorstensen
and Fenton 2003) we calculate the period excess of 3.4 +/- 0.1%, which is
typical for an SU UMa star at this orbital period. This value indicates that
the mass ratio of the system is q=0.154.",2005-06-21T12:00:59Z
"Rates of Neutrino Absorption on Nucleons and the Reverse Processes in
  Strong Magnetic Fields","The rates of electron neutrino capture on neutron, electron anti-neutrino
capture on proton, and their reverse processes are important for understanding
the production of heavy elements in the supernova environment above the
protoneutron star. Observations and theoretical considerations suggest that
some protoneutron stars may be born with strong magnetic fields. We develop a
numerical method to calculate the above rates in supernova environments with
magnetic fields up to 10^16 G. This method is accurate to the order of one over
nucleon mass. We show that our results have the correct behavior in the limit
of high neutrino energy or small magnetic field. Based on comparison of our
results with various approximations, we recommend efficient estimates of the
above rates for use in models of supernova nucleosynthesis in the presence of
strong magnetic fields.",2005-06-01T20:26:43Z
"Detection of TeV gamma-ray Emission from the Shell-Type Supernova
  Remnant RX J0852.0-4622 with H.E.S.S","We report the detection of TeV gamma-rays from the shell-type supernova
remnant RX J0852.0-4622 with data of 3.2 h of live time recorded with H.E.S.S.
in February 2004. An excess of (700 +/- 60) events from the whole remnant with
a significance of 12 sigma was found. The observed emission region is clearly
extended with a radius of the order of 1 degree and the spatial distribution of
the signal correlates with X-ray observations. The spectrum in the energy range
between 500 GeV and 15 TeV is well described by a power law with a photon index
of 2.1 +/- 0.1(stat) +/- 0.2(syst) and a differential flux at 1 TeV of (2.1 +/-
0.2(stat) +/- 0.6(syst)) 10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1} TeV^{-1}. The integral flux
above 1 TeV was measured to be (1.9 +/- 0.3(stat) +/- 0.6(syst)) 10^{-11}
cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which is at the level of the flux of the Crab nebula at these
energies. More data are needed to draw firm conclusions on the magnetic field
in the remnant and the type of the particle population creating the TeV
gamma-rays.",2005-05-18T14:15:25Z
"Constraints on gamma-ray burst and supernova progenitors through
  circumstellar absorption lines","Long gamma-ray bursts are thought to be caused by a subset of exploding
Wolf-Rayet stars. We argue that the circumstellar absorption lines in early
supernova and in gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra may allow us to determine
the main properties of the Wolf-Rayet star progenitors which can produce those
two events. To demonstrate this, we first simulate the hydrodynamic evolution
of the circumstellar medium around a 40 Msun star up to the time of the
supernova explosion. Knowledge of density, temperature and radial velocity of
the circumstellar matter as function of space and time allows us to compute the
column density in the line of sight to the centre of the nebula, as a function
of radial velocity, angle, and time. Our column density profiles indicate the
possible number, strengths, widths and velocities of absorption line components
in supernova and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra. Our example calculation
shows four distinct line features during the Wolf-Rayet stage, at about 0, 50,
150-700 and 2200 km/s, with only those of the lowest and highest velocity
present at all times. The 150-700 km/s feature decays rapidly as function of
time after the onset of the Wolf-Rayet stage. It consists of a variable number
of components, and, especially in its evolved stage, is depending strongly on
the particular line of sight. A comparison with absorption lines detected in
the afterglow of GRB 021004 suggests that the high velocity absorption
component in GRB 021004 may be attributed to the free streaming Wolf-Rayet
wind, which is consistent with the steep density drop indicated by the
afterglow light curve. The presence of the intermediate velocity components
implies that the duration of the Wolf-Rayet phase of the progenitor of GRB
021004 was much smaller than the average Wolf-Rayet life time.",2005-07-28T09:29:28Z
"The Filamentary Large Scale Structure around the z = 2.16 Radio Galaxy
  PKS 1138-262","PKS 1138-262 is a massive radio galaxy at z = 2.16 surrounded by
overdensities of Lya emitters, Ha emitters, EROs and X-ray emitters. Numerous
lines of evidence exist that it is located in a forming cluster. We report on
Keck spectroscopy of candidate members of this protocluster, including nine of
the 18 X-ray sources detected by Pentericci et al. (2002) in this field. Two of
these X-ray sources (not counting PKS 1138-262 itself) were previously
confirmed to be members of the protocluster; we have discovered that an
additional two (both AGN) are members of a filamentary structure, at least 3.5
Mpc in projection, aligned with the radio jet axis, the 150 kpc-sized
emission-line halo, and the extended X-ray emission around the radio galaxy.

"The entrainment matrix of a superfluid neutron-proton mixture at a
  finite temperature","The entrainment matrix (also termed the Andreev-Bashkin matrix or the
mass-density matrix) for a neutron-proton mixture is derived at a finite
temperature in a neutron star core. The calculation is performed in the frame
of the Landau Fermi-liquid theory generalized to account for superfluidity of
nucleons. It is shown, that the temperature dependence of the entrainment
matrix is described by a universal function independent on an actual model of
nucleon-nucleon interaction employed. The results are presented in the form
convenient for their practical use. The entrainment matrix is important, e.g.,
in kinetics of superfluid nucleon mixtures or in studies of the dynamical
evolution of neutron stars (in particular, in the studies of star pulsations
and pulsar glitches).",2005-08-03T12:11:08Z

DENIS-J055146.0-443412.2 is an M8.5+L0 pair, with a physical separation of over
200 AU. This makes it the widest very low mass binary known in the field, by an
order of magnitude. Such a system is fragile, and it would not have survived a

Automated Detection of Classical Novae with Neural Networks,"The POINT-AGAPE collaboration surveyed M31 with the primary goal of optical
detection of microlensing events, yet its data catalogue is also a prime source
of lightcurves of variable and transient objects, including classical novae
(CNe). A reliable means of identification, combined with a thorough survey of
the variable objects in M31, provides an excellent opportunity to locate and
study an entire galactic population of CNe. This paper presents a set of 440
neural networks, working in 44 committees, designed specifically to identify
fast CNe. The networks are developed using training sets consisting of
simulated novae and POINT-AGAPE lightcurves, in a novel variation on K-fold
cross-validation. They use the binned, normalised power spectra of the
lightcurves as input units. The networks successfully identify 9 of the 13
previously identified M31 CNe within their optimal working range (and 11 out of
13 if the network error bars are taken into account). They provide a catalogue
of 19 new candidate fast CNe, of which 4 are strongly favoured.",2005-04-11T11:14:10Z
"On the stratorotational instability in the quasi-hydrostatic
  semi-geostrophic limit","The linear normal-mode stratorotational instability (SRI) is analytically
reexamined in the inviscid limit where the length scales of horizontal
disturbances are large compared their vertical and radial counterparts.
Boundary conditions different than channel walls are also considered. This
quasi-hydrostatic, semi-geostrophic (QHSG) approximation allows one to examine
the effect of a vertically varying Brunt-Vaisaila frequency, $N^2$. It is found
that the normal-mode instability persists when $N^2$ increases quadratically
with respect to the disc vertical coordinate. However we also find that the SRI
seems to exist in this inviscid QHSG extreme only for channel wall conditions:
when one or both of the reflecting walls are removed there is no instability in
the asymptotic limit explored here. It is also found that only exponential-type
SRI modes (as defined by Dubrulle et al. 2005) exist under these conditions.
These equations also admit non-normal mode behaviour. Fixed Lagrangian pressure
conditions on both radial boundaries predicts there to be no normal mode
behaviour in the QHSG limit. The mathematical relationship between the results
obtained here and that of the classic Eady (1949) problem for baroclinic
instability is drawn. We conjecture as to the mathematical/physical nature of
the SRI.
  The general linear problem, analyzed without approximation in the context of
the Boussinesq equations, admits a potential vorticity-like quantity that is
advectively conserved by the shear. Its existence means that a continuous
spectrum \emph{is a generic feature of this system}. It also implies that in
places where the Brunt-Vaisaila frequency becomes dominant the linearized flow
may two-dimensionalize by advectively conserving its vertical vorticity.",2005-06-01T12:57:48Z
"The large scale structure of the Galactic magnetic field and High Energy
  Cosmic Ray anisotropy","The magnetic field in our Galaxy is not well known and is difficult to
measure. A spiral regular field in the disk between the Galactic arms is
favored by observations, however it is still controversial if the field
reverses from arm to arm. The parity of the field across the Galactic plane is
also not well established. In this letter we demonstrate that cosmic ray
protons in the energy range 10^18 to 10^19 eV, if accelerated near the center
of the Galaxy, can probe the large scale structure of the Galactic Magnetic
Field. In particular if the field is of even parity, and the spiral field
reverses direction from arm to arm, i.e. if it is bi-symmetric (BSS), ultra
high energy protons will predominantly come from the Southern Galactic
hemisphere, and predominantly from the Northern Galactic hemisphere if the
field is of even parity and axi-symmetric (ASS). There is no sensitivity to the
BSS or ASS configurations if the field is of odd parity.",2005-07-12T07:38:42Z
"The Brightest Point X-Ray Sources in Elliptical Galaxies and the Mass
  Spectrum of Accreting Black Holes","We propose that the shape of the upper-end X-ray luminosity function observed
in elliptical galaxies for point sources is a footprint of the black-hole (BH)
mass spectrum among old X-ray transients formed in the galaxies. We show that
this underlying BH mass spectrum is modified by a weighting factor that is
related to the transient duty cycle and it generally depends on the BH mass and
XRB donor type (main-sequence, red-giant, or white-dwarf donors). A duty cycle
that depends on the binary mass-transfer rate relative to the critical rate for
transient behavior is most probably favored. We also find that the derived BH
mass spectrum slope depends on the strength of angular momentum loss due to
magnetic braking for main-sequence donors. More specifically, we find that, for
``standard'' magnetic braking, BH XRBs with red-giant donors dominate the
upper-end XLF; for weaker magnetic braking prescriptions main-sequence donors
are found to be dominant. In both cases the BH mass spectrum has a differential
slope of ~2.5 and an upper BH mass cut-off at ~20 Msun is needed to understand
the very brightest of the BH XRBs in elliptical galaxies. We expect that our
result will help to constrain binary population synthesis models and the
adopted relations between black holes and the masses of their progenitors.",2005-06-20T20:34:44Z
"The Connection Between Galaxies and Intergalactic Absorption Lines at
  Redshift 2<z<3","Absorption-line spectroscopy of 23 background QSOs and numerous background
galaxies has let us measure the spatial distribution of metals and neutral
hydrogen around 1044 UV-selected galaxies at redshifts 1.8<z<3.3. The typical
galaxy is surrounded to radii r~40 proper kpc by gas that has a large velocity
spread (dv>260 km/s) and produces very strong absorption lines (N_CIV >> 10^14
cm^-2) in the spectra of background objects. Absorption with an average column
density of N_CIV ~ 10^14 cm^-2 extends to 80 kpc, a radius large enough to
imply that most strong intergalactic CIV absorption is associated with
star-forming galaxies like those in our sample. We find that the galaxy-CIV
cross-correlation length increases with CIV column density and is similar to
the galaxy-galaxy length (r_0 ~ 4 h^-1 Mpc) for N_CIV > 10^12.5 cm^-2.
Distortions in the redshift-space galaxy-CIV correlation function on small
scales may imply that some of the CIV systems have large peculiar velocities.
Four of the five detected OVI absorption systems in our sample lie within 400
proper kpc of a known galaxy. Strong Lyman-a absorption is produced by the
intergalactic gas within 1 h^-1 comoving Mpc of most galaxies, but for a
significant minority (~1/3) the absorption is weak or absent. We were unable to
identify any statistically significant differences between galaxies with weak
nearby HI absorption and the rest, although galaxies with weak absorption may
have higher star-formation rates. Galaxies near intergalactic CIV systems
appear to reside in relatively dense environments and to have distinctive
spectral energy distributions that are characterized by blue colors and young
ages. (abridged)",2005-05-06T11:08:06Z
The powerful outburst in Hercules A,"The radio source Hercules A resides at the center of a cooling flow cluster
of galaxies at redshift z = 0.154. A Chandra X-ray image reveals a shock front
in the intracluster medium (ICM) surrounding the radio source, about 160 kpc
from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) that hosts it. The shock has a Mach
number of 1.65, making it the strongest of the cluster-scale shocks driven by
an AGN outburst found so far. The age of the outburst ~5.9e7 y, its energy
about 3e61 erg and its mean power ~1.6e46 erg/s. As for the other large AGN
outbursts in cooling flow clusters, this outburst overwhelms radiative losses
from the ICM of the Hercules A cluster by a factor of ~100. It adds to the case
that AGN outbursts are a significant source of preheating for the ICM. Unless
the mechanical efficiency of the AGN in Hercules A exceeds 10%, the central

  modelling","Using the cometary nucleus model developed by Espinasse et al. (1991), we
calculate the thermodynamical evolution of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 over a period of
360 years. Starting from an initially amorphous cometary nucleus which
incorporates an icy mixture of H2O and CO, we show that, at the time of Deep
Impact collision, the crater is expected to form at depths where ice is in its
crystalline form. Hence, the subsurface exposed to space should not be
primordial. We also attempt an order-of-magnitude estimate of the heating and
material ablation effects on the crater activity caused by the 370 Kg
projectile released by the DI spacecraft. We thus show that heating effects
play no role in the evolution of crater activity. We calculate that the CO
production rate from the impacted region should be about 300-400 times higher
from the crater resulting from the impact with a 35 m ablation than over the
unperturbed nucleus in the immediate post-impact period. We also show that the
H2O production rate is decreased by several orders of magnitude at the crater
base just after ablation.",2005-06-29T13:08:41Z
Obliquity Tides on Hot Jupiters,"Obliquity tides are a potentially important source of heat for extrasolar
planets on close-in orbits. Although tidal dissipation will usually reduce the
obliquity to zero, a nonzero obliquity can persist if the planet is in a
Cassini state, a resonance between spin precession and orbital precession.
Obliquity tides might be the cause of the anomalously large size of the
transiting planet HD 209458b.",2005-06-20T20:07:07Z
"New Estimates of the Solar-Neighborhood Massive-Stars Birthrate and the
  Galactic Supernova Rate","The birthrate of stars of masses > 10 solar masses is estimated from a sample
of just over 400 O3-B2 dwarfs within 1.5 kpc of the Sun and the result
extrapolated to estimate the galactic supernova rate contributed by such stars.
The solar-neighborhood galactic-plane massive star birthrate is estimated at
176 stars per cubic kpc per million years. Based on a model where the galactic
stellar density distribution comprises a disk plus central hole like that of
the dust infrared emission (Drimmel & Spergel 2001 ApJ 556, 181) the galactic
supernova rate is estimated as probably not less than 1 nor more than 2 per
century and the number of O3-B2 dwarfs within the solar circle as ~ 200,000.",2005-06-28T21:41:50Z
"The Brightest Point X-Ray Sources in Elliptical Galaxies and the Mass
  Spectrum of Accreting Black Holes","We propose that the shape of the upper-end X-ray luminosity function observed
in elliptical galaxies for point sources is a footprint of the black-hole (BH)
mass spectrum among old X-ray transients formed in the galaxies. We show that
this underlying BH mass spectrum is modified by a weighting factor that is
related to the transient duty cycle and it generally depends on the BH mass and
XRB donor type (main-sequence, red-giant, or white-dwarf donors). A duty cycle
that depends on the binary mass-transfer rate relative to the critical rate for
transient behavior is most probably favored. We also find that the derived BH
mass spectrum slope depends on the strength of angular momentum loss due to
magnetic braking for main-sequence donors. More specifically, we find that, for
``standard'' magnetic braking, BH XRBs with red-giant donors dominate the
upper-end XLF; for weaker magnetic braking prescriptions main-sequence donors
are found to be dominant. In both cases the BH mass spectrum has a differential
slope of ~2.5 and an upper BH mass cut-off at ~20 Msun is needed to understand
the very brightest of the BH XRBs in elliptical galaxies. We expect that our
result will help to constrain binary population synthesis models and the
adopted relations between black holes and the masses of their progenitors.",2005-06-20T20:34:44Z
"The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eu nucleocosmochronology III.
  Extended sample","The first determination of the age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eu
nucleocosmochronology was accomplished by us in Papers I and II. The present
work aimed at reducing the age uncertainty by expanding the stellar sample with
the inclusion of seven new objects - an increase by 37%. A set of [Th/Eu]
abundance ratios was determined from spectral synthesis and merged with the
results from Paper I. Abundances for the new, extended sample were analyzed
with the aid of a Galactic disk chemical evolution (GDCE) model developed by us
is Paper II. The result was averaged with an estimate obtained in Paper II from
a conjunction of literature data and our GDCE model, providing our final,
adopted disk age T_G = (8.8 +/- 1.7) Gyr with a reduction of 0.1 Gyr (6%) in
the uncertainty. This value is compatible with the most up-to-date white dwarf
age determinations (<~ 10 Gyr). Considering that the halo is currently presumed
to be (13.5 +/- 0.7) Gyr old, our result prompts groups developing Galactic
formation models to include an hiatus of (4.7 +/- 1.8) Gyr between the
formation of halo and disk.",2005-06-20T14:29:30Z
Constrained Cluster Parameters from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Observations,"Near-future SZ surveys such as ACT, SPT, APEX, and Planck will find thousands
of galaxy clusters. Multi-frequency arcminute-resolution SZ observations can,
in principle, determine each cluster's gas temperature (T_e), bulk velocity
(v_pec), and optical depth (tau). However, the frequency bands and detector
sensitivity employed by upcoming surveys will generally not be sufficient to
disentangle the degeneracy between these three cluster parameters, even in the
absence of SZ signal contamination from point sources and imperfect primary
microwave background subtraction. Assuming contaminants can be removed, we find
that near-future SZ surveys will be able to constrain well two cluster gas
parameters that are linear combinations of tau*T_e, tau*v_z, and tau*T_e^2.
Because the SZ intensity shift is nearly a linear function of tau*T_e, tau*v_z,
and tau*T_e^2, a correspondence exists between the two effective gas parameters
that SZ surveys can constrain and simple line-of-sight integrals through the
three dimensional cluster. We illustrate the parameter constraints and
correspondence to line-of-sight integrals using 3D Nbody + hydro cluster
simulations and a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We show that adding an
independent T_e measurement to upcoming SZ data breaks the parameter
degeneracy. The cluster effective velocity thus constrained is approximately
the optical-depth-weighted velocity integrated along the cluster line of sight.
A temperature prior with an error as large as 2 keV still gives bulk velocity
errors < 100 km/sec, even for a more typical cluster with an electron
temperature of 3 keV, for ACT-like SZ observations in the absence of signal
contamination. The Markov chain constraints on v_pec and tau are more
encouraging and likely more accurate than those obtained from Fisher matrices.",2005-04-12T17:39:05Z
Detection of a massive dust shell around the Type II supernova SN 2002hh,"Dust emission from the Type II supernova SN 2002hh in NGC 6946 has been
detected at mid-infrared wavelengths by the Spitzer Space Telescope from 590 to
758 days after outburst and confirmed by higher angular resolution Gemini-N
mid-IR observations. The day-600 5.8-24 micron emission can be fit by a 290-K
blackbody having a luminosity of 1.6E+7 L_Sol. The minimum emitting radius of
1.1E+17 cm is too large for the emitting dust to have been formed in the
supernova ejecta. Using radiative transfer models and realistic dust grain
parameters, fits to the observed flux distribution could be obtained with an
optically thick dust shell having a mass of 0.10-0.15 M_Sol, corresponding to a
total dust+gas mass in excess of 10 M_Sol, suggesting a massive M supergiant or
luminous blue variable precursor to this self-obscured object.",2005-06-22T15:38:52Z
Fitting the HiRes Spectra,"We fit the HiRes ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) spectrum measurements
with broken power laws in order to identify features. These fits find the
previously observed feature known as the Ankle at 10**18.5 eV, as well as
evidence for a suppression at higher energies, above 10**19.8 eV. We use the
integral spectrum and the E_1/2 test to identify this high energy suppression
with the GZK suppression. Finally, we use a model of uniformly distributed
extragalactic proton sources together with a phenomenological model of the
galactic cosmic ray spectrum to compare the HiRes spectra to what should be
expected from the GZK suppression, and to measure how the extragalactic sources
must evolve and what the input spectral slope must be to fit the HiRes data.
Fits using updated spectra will be presented in Pune.",2005-07-20T17:41:18Z
"Kelu-1 is a Binary L Dwarf: First Brown Dwarf Science from Laser Guide
  Star Adaptive Optics","(Abridged) We present near-IR imaging of the nearby L dwarf Kelu-1 obtained
with the Keck sodium laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO) system as part
of a high angular resolution survey for substellar binaries. Kelu-1 was one of
the first free-floating L dwarfs identified, and the origin of its
overluminosity compared to other similar objects has been a long-standing
question. Our images clearly resolve Kelu-1 into a 0.29'' (5.4 AU) binary, and
a previous non-detection by HST demonstrates that the system is a true physical
pair. Binarity explains the properties of Kelu-1 that were previously noted to
be anomalous compared to other early-L dwarfs. We estimate spectral types of
L1.5-L3 and L3-L4.5 for the two components, giving model-derived masses of
0.05-0.07 Msun and 0.045-0.065 Msun for an estimated age of 0.3-0.8 Gyr. More
distant companions are not detected to a limit of 5-9 Mjup. The presence of
lithium absorption indicates that both components are substellar, but the
weakness of this feature relative to other L dwarfs can be explained if only
Kelu-1B is Li-bearing. Determining whether both or only one of the components
possesses lithium could constrain the age of Kelu-1 (and other Li-bearing L
binaries) with higher precision than is possible for most ultracool field
objects. These results are the first LGS AO observations of brown dwarfs and
demonstrate the potential of this new instrumental capability for substellar
astronomy.",2005-08-02T22:52:23Z
"de Vaucouleurs-Ikeuchi Diagram and Commutation Relations among Phase
  Space Coordinates","We consider the relations between de Vaucouleurs-Ikeuchi diagram and
generalized commutation relations among the coordinates and momenta. All
physical objects in the Universe ranging from elementary particles to super
cluster of galaxies are confined within the Triangle of the de
Vaucouleurs-Ikeuchi diagram on the matter density versus scale length plane.
These three boundaries are characterized by the quantum uncertainty principle,
gravitational event horizon, and cosmological constant. These are specified by
the non-zero commutation relations $[x_\mu,p_\nu], [x_\mu, x_\nu]$ (strictly
$[x_i,t]$) and $[p_\mu,p_\nu]$, respectively. The canonical commutation
relation $[x_i,p_j]$ are slightly modified, which preserves the self
consistency as a whole.",2005-04-23T03:48:34Z
"A Comparison of Elemental Abundance Ratios in Globular Clusters, Field
  Stars, and Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies","We have compiled a sample of globular clusters with high quality stellar
abundances from the literature to compare to the chemistries of stars in the
Galaxy and those in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Of the 45 globular clusters
examined, 29 also have kinematic information. Most of the globular clusters
belong to the Galactic halo, however a signficant number have disk kinematics
or belong to the bulge. Focusing on the [alpha/Fe] and light r-process element
ratios, we find that most globular cluster stars mimic those of the field stars
of similar metallicities, and neither clearly resembles the presently available
stellar abundances in the dwarf galaxies (including the globular clusters in
the Large Magellanic Cloud). The exceptions to these general elemental ratio
comparisons are already known in the literature, e.g., omega Centauri, Palomar
12, and Terzan 7 associated with the Sagittarius remnant, and Ruprecht 106
which has a high radial velocity and low [alpha/Fe] ratio. A few other globular
clusters show more marginal peculiarities. The most notable one being the halo
cluster M68 which has a high Galactocentric rotational velocity, a slightly
younger age, and a unique [Si/Ti] ratio. The [Si/Ti] ratios decrease with
increasing [Fe/H] at intermediate metallicities, which is consistent with very
massive stars playing a larger role in the early chemical evolution of the
Galaxy. The chemical similarities between globular clusters and field stars
with [Fe/H]<-1.0 suggests a shared chemical history in a well mixed early
Galaxy. The differences to the published chemistries of stars in the dwarf
spheroidal galaxies suggests that neither the globular clusters, halo stars,
nor thick disk stars had their origins in small isolated systems like the
present-day Milky Way dwarf satellites.",2005-06-10T14:02:09Z
"Postbounce evolution of core-collapse supernovae: Long-term effects of
  equation of state","We study the evolution of supernova core from the beginning of gravitational
collapse of a 15Msolar star up to 1 second after core bounce. We present
results of spherically symmetric simulations of core-collapse supernovae by
solving general relativistic neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamics in the implicit
time-differencing. We aim to explore the evolution of shock wave in a long term
and investigate the formation of protoneutron star together with supernova
neutrino signatures. These studies are done to examine the influence of
equation of state (EOS) on the postbounce evolution of shock wave in the late
phase and the resulting thermal evolution of protoneutron star. We make a
comparison of two sets of EOS, that is, by Lattimer and Swesty (LS-EOS) and by
Shen et al.(SH-EOS). We found that, for both EOSs, the core does not explode
and the shock wave stalls similarly in the first 100 milliseconds after bounce.
The revival of shock wave does not occur even after a long period in either
cases. However, the recession of shock wave appears different beyond 200
milliseconds after bounce, having different thermal evolution of central core.
A more compact protoneutron star is found for LS-EOS than SH-EOS with a
difference in the central density by a factor of ~2 and a difference of ~10 MeV
in the peak temperature. Resulting spectra of supernova neutrinos are different
to the extent that may be detectable by terrestrial neutrino detectors.",2005-06-25T04:26:39Z
"Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of Globular Cluster Candidates in Low
  Surface Brightness Dwarf Galaxies","Fifty-seven nearby low surface brightness dwarf galaxies were searched for
globular cluster candidates (GCCs) using Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 imaging
in V and I. The sample consists of 18 dwarf spheroidal (dSph), 36 irregular
(dIrr), and 3 ""transition"" type (dIrr/dSph) galaxies with angular sizes less
than 3.7 kpc situated at distances 2-6 Mpc in the field and in the nearby
groups: M81, Centaurus A, Sculptor, Canes Venatici I cloud. We find that ~50%
of dSph, dIrr/dSph, and dIrr galaxies contain GCCs. The fraction of GCCs
located near the center of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is >2 times higher than
that for dIrrs. The mean integral color of GCCs in dSphs, V-I = 1.04+/-0.16
mag, coincides with the corresponding value for Galactic globular clusters and
is similar to the blue globular cluster sub-populations in massive early-type
galaxies. The color distribution for GCCs in dIrrs shows a clear bimodality
with peaks near V-I = 0.5 and 1.0 mag. Blue GCCs are presumably young with ages
t < 1 Gyr, while the red GCC population is likely to be older. The detected
GCCs have absolute visual magnitudes between M_V = -10 and -5 mag. We find
indications for an excess population of faint GCCs with M_V > -6.5 mag in both
dSph and dIrr galaxies, reminiscent of excess populations of faint globular
clusters in nearby Local Group spiral galaxies. The measurement of structural
parameters using King-profile fitting reveals that most GCCs have structural
parameters similar to extended outer halo globular clusters in the Milky Way
and M31, as well as the recently discovered population of ""faint fuzzy""
clusters in nearby lenticular galaxies.",2005-05-31T15:08:24Z
On the nature of the radio quiet X-ray neutron star 1E 1207.4-5209,"The strange timing property of X-ray pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209 can be explained
by the hypothesis that it is a member of an ultra-compact binary system. This
paper confronts the ultra-compact assumption with the observed properties of
this pulsar. The gravitational potential well of an ultra-compact binary can
enlarge the corotation radius and thus make it possible for accreting material
to reach the surface of the NS in the low accretion rate case. Thus the
generation of the absorption features should be similar to the case of
accreting pulsars. The close equality of the energy loss by fast cooling of the
postsupernova neutron star and the energy dissipation needed for a wide binary
evolving to an ultra-compact binary demonstrates that the ultra-compact binary
may be formed in 10-100yr after the second supernova explosion. Moreover, the
ultra-compact binary hypothesis can well explain the the absence of optical
counterpart and the observed two black body emissions. We suggest a simple
method which can test the binary nature directly with XMM-Newton and Chandra
observations. We further predict that the temperature of the two black bodies
should vary at different pulse periods.",2005-03-29T00:26:58Z
Blue Luminescence and the Presence of Small PAHs in the ISM,"Blue Luminescence (BL) was first discovered in a proto-planetary nebula, the
Red Rectangle (RR) surrounding the post-AGB star HD 44179. BL has been
attributed to fluorescence by small, 3-4 ringed neutral polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules, and was thought to be unique to the RR environment
where such small molecules are actively being produced and shielded from the
harsh interstellar radiation by a dense circumstellar disk. In this paper we
present the BL spectrum detected in several ordinary reflection nebulae
illuminated by stars having temperatures between 10,000 -- 23,000 K. All these
nebulae are known to also exhibit the infrared emission features called
aromatic emission features (AEFs) attributed to large PAHs. We present the
spatial distribution of the BL in these nebulae. In the case of Ced~112, the BL
is spatially correlated with mid-IR emission structures attributed to AEFs.
These observations provide evidence for grain processing and possibly for
in-situ formation of small grains and large molecules from larger aggregates.
Most importantly, the detection of BL in these ordinary reflection nebulae
suggests that the BL carrier is an ubiquitous component of the ISM and is not
restricted to the particular environment of the RR.",2005-07-13T16:18:11Z
Improved Templates for Photometric Redshifts of Submm Sources,"There is growing evidence that some star-forming galaxies at z>1 are
characterized by high efficiencies and specific star formation rates. In the
local universe, these traits are shared by ``active'' Blue Compact Dwarf
galaxies (BCDs) with compact and dense star-forming regions. The Spectral
Energy Distributions (SEDs) of these BCDs are dominated by young massive star
clusters, embedded in a cocoon of dust. In this Letter, we incorporate these
BCD SEDs as templates for two samples of high-redshift galaxy populations
selected at submm wavelengths. Because of the severe absorption of the optical
light, the featureless mid-infrared spectrum, and the relatively flat radio
continuum, the dusty star-cluster SEDs are good approximations to most of the
submm sources in our samples. In most cases, the active BCD SEDs fit the
observed photometric points better than the ``standard'' templates, M 82 and
Arp 220, and predict photometric redshifts significantly closer to the
spectroscopic ones. Our results strongly suggest that the embedded dusty star
clusters in BCD galaxies are superior to other local templates such as M 82 and
Arp 220 in fitting distant submm starburst galaxies.",2005-05-06T15:45:51Z
"The chemistry of fluorine-bearing molecules in diffuse and dense
  interstellar gas clouds","We present a theoretical investigation of the chemistry of fluorine-bearing
molecules in diffuse and dense interstellar gas clouds. The chemistry of
interstellar fluorine is qualitatively different from that of any other
element, because - unlike the neutral atoms of any other element found in
diffuse or dense molecular clouds - atomic fluorine undergoes an exothermic
reaction with molecular hydrogen. Over a wide range of conditions attained
within interstellar gas clouds, the product of that reaction - hydrogen
fluoride - is predicted to be the dominant gas-phase reservoir of interstellar
fluorine nuclei. Our model predicts HF column densities ~ 1.E+13 cm-2 in dark
clouds and column densities as large as 1.E-11 cm-2 in diffuse interstellar gas
clouds with total visual extinctions as small as 0.1 mag. Such diffuse clouds
will be detectable by means of absorption line spectroscopy of the J = 1 - 0
transition at 243.2 micron using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA) and the Herschel Space Observatory (HSO). The CF+ ion is
predicted to be the second most abundant fluorine-bearing molecule, with
typical column densities a factor ~ 100 below those of HF; with its lowest two
rotational transitions in the millimeter-wave spectral region, CF+ may be
detectable from ground-based observatories. HF absorption in quasar spectra is
a potential probe of molecular gas at high redshift, providing a possible
bridge between the UV/optical observations capable of probing H2 in low column
density systems and the radio/millimeter-wavelength observations that probe
intervening molecular clouds of high extinction and large molecular fraction;
at redshifts beyond ~ 0.3, HF is potentially detectable from ground-based
submillimeter observatories in several atmospheric transmission windows.",2005-04-13T19:44:03Z
"Sun's retrograde motion and violation of even-odd cycle rule in sunspot
  activity","The sum of sunspots number over an odd numbered 11 yr sunspot cycle exceeds
that of its preceding even numbered cycle, and it is well known as Gnevyshev
and Ohl rule (or G--O rule) after the names of the authors who discovered it in
1948. The G--O rule can be used to predict the sum of sunspot numbers of a
forthcoming odd cycle from that of its preceding even cycle. But this is not
always possible because occasionally the G--O rule is violated. So far no
plausible reason is known either for the G--O rule or the violation of this
rule. Here we showed the epochs of the violation of the G--O rule are close to
the epochs of the Sun's retrograde orbital motion about the centre of mass of
the solar system (i.e., the epochs at which the orbital angular momentum of the
Sun is weakly negative). Using this result easy to predict the epochs of
violation of the G--O rule well in advance. We also showed that the solar
equatorial rotation rate determined from sunspot group data during the period
1879--2004 is correlated/anti-correlated to the Sun's orbital torque during
before/after 1945. We have found the existence of a statistically significant
$\sim$ 17 yr periodicity in the solar equatorial rotation rate. The
implications of these findings for understanding the mechanism behind the solar
cycle and the solar-terrestrial relationship are discussed.",2005-07-12T01:50:16Z
"A Gas-poor Planetesimal Capture Model for the Formation of Giant Planet
  Satellite Systems","Assuming that an unknown mechanism (e.g., gas turbulence) removes most of the
subnebula gas disk in a timescale shorter than that for satellite formation, we
develop a model for the formation of regular (and possibly at least some of the
irregular) satellites around giant planets in a gas-poor environment. In this
model, which follows along the lines of the work of Safronov et al. (1986),
heliocentric planetesimals collide within the planet's Hill sphere and generate
a circumplanetary disk of prograde and retrograde satellitesimals extending as
far out as $\sim R_H/2$. At first, the net angular momentum of this
proto-satellite swarm is small, and collisions among satellitesimals leads to
loss of mass from the outer disk, and delivers mass to the inner disk (where
regular satellites form) in a timescale $\lesssim 10^5$ years. This mass loss
may be offset by continued collisional capture of sufficiently small $< 1$ km
interlopers resulting from the disruption of planetesimals in the feeding zone
of the giant planet. As the planet's feeding zone is cleared in a timescale
$\lesssim 10^5$ years, enough angular momentum may be delivered to the
proto-satellite swarm to account for the angular momentum of the regular
satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.(abridged)",2005-04-28T20:20:34Z
"FUSE Measurements of Far Ultraviolet Extinction. II. Magellanic Cloud
  Sight Lines","We present an extinction analysis of 9 paths through the LMC and SMC based on
FUSE observations. To date, just two LMC sight lines have probed dust grain
composition and size distributions in the Clouds using spectra including
wavelengths as short as 950 A. We supplement these with results from 4 regions
distinguished by their IR through UV extinction curves and grouped as LMCAvg,
LMC2, SMC bar and SMC wing. Despite the distinct characters of Milky Way and
Magellanic Cloud extinction, our results are generally analogous to those found
for Galactic curves in that the FUSE portions of each extinction curve are
described reasonably well by FM curves fitted only to longer wavelength data
and lack any dramatic new extinction features, and any deviations from the CCM
formalism continue into FUV wavelengths. An MEM analysis of these curves
suggests that LMCAvg and SMC wing sight lines require more silicon and/or
carbon in dust than current abundance measurements would allow, while the
requirements for LMC2 and SMC bar sight lines do not fully tax the available
reservoirs. An intermediate product of this analysis is the measurement of new
H_2 abundances in the Magellanic Clouds. Collectively considering Cloud sight
lines that possess significant H_2 column densities, E(B-V)/N(HI) ratios are
reduced by significant factors relative to the Galactic mean, whereas the
corresponding E(B-V)/N(H_2) values more closely resemble their Galactic
counterpart. These trends reflect the fact that among these sight lines
f(H_2)-values are lower than those common in the Milky Way for paths with
similar degrees of reddening.",2005-05-19T19:15:30Z
"Filaments as Possible Signatures of Magnetic Field Structure in
  Planetary Nebulae","We draw attention to the extreme filamentary structures seen in
high-resolution optical images of certain planetary nebulae. We determine the
physical properties of the filaments in the nebulae IC 418, NGC 3132, and NGC
6537, and based on their large length-to-width ratios, longitudinal coherence,
and morphology, we suggest that they may be signatures of the underlying
magnetic field. The fields needed for the coherence of the filaments are
probably consistent with those measured in the precursor circumstellar
envelopes. The filaments suggest that magnetic fields in planetary nebulae may
have a localized and thread-like geometry.",2005-03-31T00:43:10Z
A Library of Integrated Spectra of Galactic Globular Clusters,"We present a new library of integrated spectra of 40 Galactic globular
clusters, obtained with the Blanco 4-m telescope and the R-C spectrograph at
the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory. The spectra cover the range ~ 3350
-- 6430 A with ~ 3.1 A (FWHM) resolution. The spectroscopic observations and
data reduction were designed to integrate the full projected area within the
cluster core radii in order to properly sample the light from stars in all
relevant evolutionary stages. The S/N values of the flux-calibrated spectra
range from 50 to 240/A at 4000 A and from 125 to 500/A at 5000 A. The selected
targets span a wide range of cluster parameters, including metallicity,
horizontal-branch morphology, Galactic coordinates, Galactocentric distance,
and concentration. The total sample is thus fairly representative of the entire
Galactic globular cluster population and should be valuable for comparison with
similar integrated spectra of unresolved stellar populations in remote systems.
For most of the library clusters, our spectra can be coupled with deep
color-magnitude diagrams and reliable metal abundances from the literature to
enable the calibration of stellar population synthesis models. In this paper we
present a detailed account of the observations and data reduction. The spectral
library is publicly available in electronic format from the National Optical
Astronomical Observatory website.",2005-04-14T14:01:35Z
"Fluorine Abundance Variations in Red Giants of the Globular Cluster M4
  and Early-Cluster Chemical Pollution","We present fluorine abundances in seven red-giant members of the globular
cluster M4 (NGC 6121). These abundances were derived from the HF (1--0) R9 line
at 2.3357 microns in high-resolution infrared spectra obtained with the Phoenix
spectrograph on Gemini-South. Many abundances in the target stars have been
studied previously, so that their overall abundance distributions are
well-mapped. The abundance of fluorine is found to vary by more than a factor
of 6, with the F-19 variations being correlated with the already established
oxygen variations, and anti-correlated with the sodium and aluminium
variations. In this paper we thus add fluorine to the list of elements known to
vary in globular cluster stars, and this provides further evidence that
H-burning is the root cause of the chemical inhomegeneities. The fact that F-19
is found to decrease in the M4 stars, as the signature of H-burning appears,
indicates that the polluting stars must have masses greater than about 3.5
solar masses, as less massive stars than this should produce, not destroy,
fluorine.",2005-06-30T16:45:35Z
Orbital Parameters of the Microquasar LSI +61 303,"New optical spectroscopy of the HMXB microquasar LSI +61 303 is presented.
Eccentric orbital fits to our radial velocity measurements yield updated
orbital parameters in good agreement with previous work. Our orbital solution
indicates that the periastron passage occurs at radio phase 0.23 and the
X-ray/radio outbursts are triggered 2.5--4 days after the compact star passage.
The spectrum of the optical star is consistent with a B0 V spectral type and
contributes ~65 percent of the total light, the remaining due to emission by a
circumstellar disc. We also measure the projected rotational velocity to be v
sin i = 113 km/s.",2005-04-14T16:20:26Z

"Faint Blue Objects in the Hubble Deep Field South Revealed: White
  Dwarfs, Subdwarfs, and Quasars","We explore the nature of the faint blue objects in the Hubble Deep Field
South. We have derived proper motions for the point sources in the Hubble Deep
Field South using a 3 year baseline. Combining our proper motion measurements
with spectral energy distribution fitting enabled us to identify 4 quasars and
42 stars, including 3 white dwarf candidates. Two of these white dwarf
candidates, HDFS 1444 and 895, are found to display significant proper motion,
21.1 $\pm$ 7.9 mas/yr and 34.9 $\pm$ 8.0 mas/yr, and are consistent with being
thick disk or halo white dwarfs located at ~2 kpc. The other faint blue objects
analyzed by Mendez & Minniti do not show any significant proper motion and are
inconsistent with being halo white dwarfs; they do not contribute to the
Galactic dark matter. The observed population of stars and white dwarfs is
consistent with standard Galactic models.",2005-07-22T05:44:27Z
"Infrared Surface Brightness Distances to Cepheids: a comparison of
  Bayesian and linear-bisector calculations","We have compared the results of Bayesian statistical calculations and
linear-bisector calculations for obtaining Cepheid distances and radii by the
infrared surface brightness method. We analyzed a set of 38 Cepheids using a
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that had been recently studied with a
linear-bisector method. The distances obtained by the two techniques agree to
1.5 \pm 0.6% with the Bayesian distances being larger. The radii agree to 1.1%
\pm 0.7% with the Bayesian determinations again being larger. We interpret this
result as demonstrating that the two methods yield the same distances and
radii. This implies that the short distance to the LMC found in recent
linear-bisector studies of Cepheids is not caused by deficiencies in the
mathematical treatment. However, the computed uncertainties in distance and
radius for our dataset are larger in the Bayesian calculation by factors of
1.4-6.7. We give reasons to favor the Bayesian computations of the
uncertainties. The larger uncertainties can have a significant impact upon
interpretation of Cepheid distances and radii obtained from the infrared
surface brightness method.",2005-06-03T15:25:24Z
"Central Blue Clumps in Elliptical Galaxies of the Hubble Ultra Deep
  Field","Elliptical galaxies larger than 10 pixels in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
(UDF) were surveyed for internal structure; 30 out of 100 in a sample of 884
morphologically classified galaxies exhibit large blue clumps near their
centers. Unsharp-masked images of the best cases are presented. The
distributions of the clumps on color-color and color-magnitude diagrams are
about the same as the distributions of isolated objects in the UDF field with
the same size, suggesting a possible accretion origin. In the few cases where
redshifts are published, the clump masses and star-formation ages were
determined from stellar evolution models, as were the galaxy masses. The clump
mass scales with galaxy mass, probably because of selection effects, and ranges
from 10^6 Msun to 10^8 Msun for galaxies with masses from 10^{9} Msun to
10^{11} Msun. The clump star formation age ranges between 10^7 yr and 2x10^8
yr. With partial evaporation and core contraction in the intervening years,
some of these clumps could resemble globular clusters today. Stars that
evaporate will contribute to the field population in the elliptical galaxy.",2005-04-01T18:33:09Z
"The CFHT Legacy Survey: The Morphology-Density Relation of Galaxies out
  to Z~1","We study the relationships between galaxy total luminosity (M_g), morphology,
color and environment as a function of redshift. We use a magnitude-limited
sample of 65,624 galaxies in the redshift range 0<z<1.3 taken from one of the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep Fields. We parametrize galaxy
morphology according to the Sersic index n. Our n>2 number fractions at z=0.1
agree well with those based on SDSS galaxies. We find that the n>2 galaxy
number fraction is constant with redshift in the field. However, for overdense
environments this fraction is larger and increases towards lower redshifts,
higher densities and higher luminosities. Rest-frame color-magnitude diagrams
show that the color distribution is bimodal out to our redshift limit of z~1
with a prominent red-sequence of galaxies at 0.2<z<0.4 and a large blue-peak
dominance at 0.8<z<1. We use this bimodality to define a red galaxy fraction
(rest-frame u-g>1). For all environments, this fraction increases towards lower
redshifts and higher luminosities. The red fraction within cluster-like regions
changes 60% faster with redshift as compared to the field for M_g<-19.5. Using,
for the first time, observations across many cluster-field interfaces
distributed over a single, large volume, we trace the large-scale
morphology-density relation and the Butcher-Oemler effect over a period of
almost 8 Gyr.",2005-05-06T12:17:24Z
"On metal-deficient barium stars and their link with yellow symbiotic
  stars","This paper addresses the question of why metal-deficient barium stars are not
yellow symbiotic stars (YSyS). Samples of (suspected) metal-deficient barium
(mdBa) stars and YSyS have been collected from the literature, and their
properties reviewed. It appears in particular that the barium nature of the
suspected mdBa stars needs to be ascertained by detailed abundance analyses.
Abundances are therefore derived for two of them, HD 139409 and HD 148897,
which reveal that HD 148897 should not be considered a barium star. HD 139409
is a mild barium star, with overabundances observed only for elements belonging
to the first s-process peak (Y and Zr). The evidence for binarity among mdBa
stars is then reviewed, using three different methods: (i) radial-velocity
variations (from CORAVEL observations), (ii) Hipparcos astrometric data, and
(iii) a method based on the comparison between the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 proper
motions. A first-time orbit is obtained for HIP 55852, whereas evidence for the
(so far unknown) binary nature of HIP 34795, HIP 76605, HIP 97874 and HIP
107478 is presented. Two stars with no evidence for binarity whatsoever (HIP
58596 and BD +3 2688) are candidates low-metallicity thermally-pulsing
asymptotic giant branch stars, as inferred from their large luminosities. The
reason why mdBa stars are not YSyS is suggested to lie in their different
orbital period distributions: mdBa stars have on average longer orbital periods
than YSyS, and hence their companion accretes matter at a lower rate, for a
given mass loss rate of the giant star. The definite validation of this
explanation should nevertheless await the determination of the orbital periods
for the many mdBa stars still lacking periods, in order to make the comparison
more significant.",2005-06-24T13:00:39Z
"The GRB of 1999 January 23: prompt emission and broad-band afterglow
  modeling","We report on BeppoSAX simultaneous X- and gamma-ray observations of the
bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) 990123. We present the broad-band spectrum of the
prompt emission, including optical, X- and gamma-rays, confirming the
suggestion that the emission mechanisms at low and high frequencies must have
different physical origins. We discuss the X-ray afterglow observed by the
Narrow Field Instruments (NFIs) on board BeppoSAX and its hard X-ray emission
up to 60 keV several hours after the burst, in the framework of the standard
fireball model. The effects of including an important contribution of Inverse
Compton scattering or modifying the hydrodynamics are studied.",2005-05-02T13:12:56Z
Orbital and spin variability of the Intermediate Polar BG CMi,"Results of a CCD study of the variability of the cataclysmic variable BG CMi
obtained at the Korean 1.8m telescope in 2002-2005 are presented. The
""multi-comparison star"" method had been applied for better accuracy estimates.
The linear ephemeris based on 19 mean maxima for 2002--2005 is HJD
2453105.31448(6)+0.01057257716(198)(E-764707). The period differs from that
predicted by the quadratic ephemeris by Pych et al. (1996) leading to a
possible cycle miscount. The statistically optimal ephemeris is a fourth-order
polynomial, as a quadratic or even a cubic ephemeris leads to unaceptably large
residuals: Min.HJD=$ 2445020.28095(28)+0.0105729609(57)E
-1.58(32)\cdot10^{-13}E^2-5.81(64)\cdot10^{-19}E^3+4.92(41)\cdot10^{-25}E^4.$
Thus the rate of the spin-up of the white dwarf is decreasing. An alternative
explanation is that the spin-up has been stopped during recent years. The
deviations between the amplutudes of the spin variability in V and R, as well
as between phases are not statistically significant. However, the orbital light
curves exhibit distinct difference; the corresponding color index shows a
nearly sinusoidal shape with a maximum at orbital phase $\sim0.2.$ The
variations of the amplitude of spin waves shows a short maximum at the phase of
the orbital dip. The corrected ephemeris for orbital minima is
Min.HJD=$2448368.7225(12)+0\fd13474841(6)\cdot(E-24849)$ with a narrow dip
occuring 0.07P later. The rate of the spin period variation seems to be
changed, justifying the necessity of regular observations of intermediate
polars.",2005-07-05T04:51:23Z
"The Effective Temperature Scale of Galactic Red Supergiants: Cool, But
  Not As Cool As We Thought","We use moderate-resolution optical spectrophotometry and the new MARCS
stellar atmosphere models to determine the effective temperatures of 74
Galactic red supergiants. From these we find a new effective temperature scale
that is significantly warmer than those in the literature. We show that this
temperature scale, along with the newly derived bolometric corrections, gives
much better agreement between our red supergiants and stellar evolutionary
tracks. This agreement provides an independent verification of our new
temperature scale. The combination of effective temperature and bolometric
luminosities allows us to calculate stellar radii; the coolest and most
luminous stars have radii of roughly 1500 solar radii (7 AU), in excellent
accordance with the largest stellar radii predicted from current evolutionary
theory. We find that similar results are obtained for the effective
temperatures and bolometric luminosities using only the de-reddened V-K colors,
providing a powerful demonstration of the self-consistency of the MARCS models.",2005-04-15T02:25:47Z
A compact starburst ring traced by clumpy OH megamaser emission,"We model the OH megamaser emission from the luminous infrared galaxy IIIZw35
as arising from a narrow rotating starburst ring of radius 22 pc enclosing a
mass of 7 x 10^6 Msun. We show how both the compact and apparently diffuse
maser emission from this ring can arise from a single phase of unsaturated
maser clouds amplifying background radio continuum. The masing clouds are
estimated to have a diameter of <0.7 pc and internal velocity dispersion of
about 20 km/s. We find that the clouds are neither self-gravitating nor
pressure confined but are freely expanding. Their dispersal lifetimes may set
the vertical thickness of the ring. For an estimated internal density of 3 x
10^3 cm^-3, cloud masses are of order 24 Msun. The observed spectral features
and velocity gradients indicate that the clouds must be outflowing and escaping
the nucleus. The cloud mass outflow rate is estimated to be 0.8 Msun/yr, while
the star formation rate is about 19 Msun/yr. Associated ionised gas, possibly
generated from dissipated clouds, provides free-free absorption along the
source axis, explaining the observed East-West asymmetries. We show that the
clumpiness of a maser medium can have a dramatic effect on what is observed
even in a relatively low gain OH megamaser. Specifically, in IIIZw35 our clumpy
maser model naturally explains the large line to continuum ratios, the large
1667MHz:1665MHz line ratios and the wide velocity dispersions seen in the
compact maser spots. Other astrophysical masers showing both compact and
apparently diffuse emission might be explained by similar clumpy structures.",2005-07-19T11:28:10Z
Radio Spectral Index Study of the SNRs OA184 and VRO42.05.01,"New images of the Supernova Remnants (SNRs) OA184 and VRO42.05.01 are
presented at 408 MHz and 1420 MHz, from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey
(CGPS) data. The SNRs' flux densities at both 408 MHz and 1420 MHz are found
and corrected for flux from compact sources within the SNRs. The integrated
flux-density based spectral indices (S$_{\nu}$$\propto$$\nu$$^{-\alpha}$) are
0.25+-0.03 for OA184 and 0.36+-0.06 for VRO42.05.01. These agree with the
respective T-T plot spectral indexes of 0.23+-0.06 and 0.36+-0.03. OA184's
spectral index is smaller than previously published values. The older flux
density values of OA184 from lower resolution data include a contribution from
a non-SNR ridge emission region and from compact sources within OA184.
Subtracting these contributions results in a spectral index of 0.32+-0.06 (38
MHz to 2695 MHz) or 0.28+-0.06 (408 MHz to 2695 MHz). Correction of published
fluxes for point sources for VRO.42.05.01 results in a spectral index of
0.32+-0.05 for 38 MHz to 2695 MHz. We also find spatial variations of spectral
index. For OA184 $\alpha$ varies from 0.1 to 0.3 (with errors $\simeq$0.1). For
VRO42.05.01, the shell region has $\alpha$=0.31 and the wing region has
$\alpha=0.47$ (with errors $\simeq$0.03).",2005-05-24T21:27:11Z
On the difference between type E and A OH/IR stars,"The observed SEDs of a sample of 60 OH/IR stars are fitted using a radiative
transfer model of a dusty envelope. Among the whole sample, 21 stars have
reliable phase-lag distances while the others have less accurate distances.
L*-P,Mlr-P and Mlr-L* relations have been plotted for these stars. It is found
that type E (with emission feature at 10um and type A (with absorption feature
at 10um) OH/IR stars have different L*-P and Mlr-L* relations while both of
them follow a single Mlr-P relation. The type E stars are proven to be located
in the area without large scale dense interstellar medium while the type A
stars are located probably in dense interstellar medium. It is argued here that
this may indicate the two types of OH/IR stars have different chemical
composition or zero age main sequence mass and so evolve in different ways.
This conclusion has reinforced the argument by Chen et al.(2001) who reached a
similar conclusion from the galactic distribution of about 1000 OH/IR stars
with the IRAS low-resolution spectra (LRS).",2005-03-25T08:38:03Z
"The 24 micron Luminosity Function of spectroscopic SWIRE sources from
  the Lockman validation field","A spectroscopic follow-up of SWIRE sources from the Lockman Validation Field
has allowed the determination of the SWIRE 24 micron Luminosity Function (LF).
The spectroscopic sample was chosen above a 24 micron flux limit at 260 microJy
and an r-band optical limit of r<21. A spectroscopic completeness of 82.5% was
achieved. We found the median redshift for the sample to be z_med=0.29.
Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) and Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)
techniques were employed to fit a parametric LF. Our result of the local LF
(LLF) is consistent with the local 25 micron determination from Shupe et al.
1998. We split the sample at a redshift of z_split=0.36 and find strong
evidence for galaxy evolution.",2005-03-21T15:59:08Z
Fractal Approach to Large-Scale Galaxy Distribution,"We present a review of the history and the present state of the fractal
approach to the large-scale distribution of galaxies. Angular correlation
function was used as a general instrument for the structure analysis. It was
realized later that a normalization condition for the reduced correlation
function estimator results in distorted values for both R_{hom} and fractal
dimension D. Moreover, according to a theorem on projections of fractals,
galaxy angular catalogues can not be used for detecting a structure with the
fractal dimension D>2. For this 3-d maps are required, and indeed modern
extensive redshift-based 3-d maps have revealed the ``hidden'' fractal
dimension of about 2, and have confirmed superclustering at scales even up to
500 Mpc (e.g. the Sloan Great Wall). On scales, where the fractal analysis is
possible in completely embedded spheres, a power--law density field has been
found. The fractal dimension D =2.2 +- 0.2 was directly obtained from 3-d maps
and R_{hom} has expanded from 10 Mpc to scales approaching 100 Mpc. In
concordance with the 3-d map results, modern all sky galaxy counts in the
interval 10^m - 15^m give a 0.44m-law which corresponds to D=2.2 within a
radius of 100h^{-1}_{100} Mpc. We emphasize that the fractal mass--radius law
of galaxy clustering has become a key phenomenon in observational cosmology.",2005-05-10T12:00:51Z
Dynamical bar instability in a relativistic rotational core collapse,"We investigate the rotational core collapse of a rapidly rotating
relativistic star by means of a 3+1 hydrodynamical simulations in conformally
flat spacetime of general relativity. We concentrate our investigation to the
bounce of the rotational core collapse, since potentially most of the
gravitational waves from it are radiated around the core bounce. The dynamics
of the star is started from a differentially rotating equilibrium star of T/W ~
0.16 (T is the rotational kinetic energy and W is the gravitational binding
energy of the equilibrium star), depleting the pressure to initiate the
collapse and to exceed the threshold of dynamical bar instability. Our finding
is that the collapsing star potentially forms a bar when the star has a
toroidal structure due to the redistribution of the angular momentum at the
core bounce. On the other hand, the collapsing star weakly forms a bar when the
star has a spheroidal structure. We also find that the bar structure of the
star is destroyed when the torus is destroyed in the rotational core collapse.
Since the collapse of a toroidal star potentially forms a bar, it can be a
promising source of gravitational waves which will be detected in advanced
LIGO.",2005-05-19T21:01:58Z
"The Las Campanas Infra-red Survey. V. Keck Spectroscopy of a large
  sample of Extremely Red Objects","(Abridged) We present deep Keck spectroscopy, using the DEIMOS and LRIS
spectrographs, of a large and representative sample of 67 ``Extremely Red
Objects'' (EROs) to H=20.5, with I-H>3.0, in three of the Las Campanas Infrared
Survey fields. Spectroscopic redshifts are determined for 44 sources, of which
only two are contaminating low mass stars. When allowance is made for
incompleteness, the spectroscopic redshift distribution closely matches that
predicted earlier on the basis of photometric data. Our spectra are of
sufficient quality that we can address the important question of the nature and
homogeneity of the z>0.8 ERO population. A dominant old stellar population is
inferred for 75% of our spectroscopic sample; a higher fraction than that seen
in smaller, less-complete samples with broader photometric selection criteria
(e.g. R-K). However, only 28% have spectra with no evidence of recent star
formation activity, such as would be expected for a strictly passively-evolving
population. More than ~30% of our absorption line spectra are of the `E+A' type
with prominent Balmer absorption consistent, on average, with mass growth of
5-15% in the past Gyr. We use our spectroscopic redshifts to improve earlier
estimates of the spatial clustering of this population as well as to understand
the significant field-to-field variation. Our spectroscopy enables us to
pinpoint a filamentary structure at z=1.22 in the Chandra Deep Field South.
Overall, our study suggests that the bulk of the ERO population is an
established population of clustered massive galaxies undergoing intermittent
activity consistent with continued growth over the redshift interval 0.8<z<1.6.",2005-05-06T11:04:10Z
"Radial Distribution of Production Rates, Loss Rates and Densities
  Corresponding to Ion Masses <=40 amu in the Inner Coma of Comet Halley:
  Composition and Chemistry","In this paper we have studied the chemistry of C, H, N, O, and S compounds
corresponding to ions of masses <=40 amu in the inner coma of the comet
1P/Halley. The production rates, loss rates, and ion mass densities are
calculated using the Analytical Yield Spectrum approach and solving coupled
continuity equation controlled by the steady state photochemical equilibrium
condition. The primary ionization sources in the model are solar EUV photons,
photoelectrons, and auroral electrons of the solar wind origin. The chemical
model couples ion-neutral, electron-neutral, photon-neutral and electron-ion
reactions among ions, neutrals, electrons, and photons through over 600
chemical reactions. Of the 46 ions considered in the model the chemistry of 24
important ions are discussed in this paper. The calculated ion mass densities

"NOAO Fundamental Plane Survey -- II. Age and Metallicity along the Red
  Sequence","We present spectroscopic linestrength data for 4097 red-sequence galaxies in
93 low-redshift galaxy clusters, and use these to investigate variations in
average stellar populations as a function of galaxy mass. Our analysis includes
an improved treatment of nebular emission contamination, which affects ~10% of
the sample galaxies. Using the stellar population models of D. Thomas and
collaborators, we simultaneously fit twelve observed linestrength-sigma
relations in terms of common underlying trends of age, [Z/H] (total
metallicity) and a/Fe (alpha-element enhancement). We find that the observed
linestrength-sigma relations can be explained only if higher-mass red-sequence
galaxies are, on average, older, more metal rich, and more alpha-enhanced than
lower-mass galaxies. Quantitatively, the scaling relations are
age=sigma^(0.59+/-0.13), Z/H=sigma^(0.53+/-0.08) and a/Fe=sigma^(0.31+/-0.06),
where the errors reflect the range obtained using different subsets of indices.
We conclude that although the stars in giant red galaxies in clusters formed
early, most of the galaxies at the faint end joined the red sequence only at
recent epochs. This ""down-sizing"" trend is in good qualitative agreement with
observations of the red sequence at higher redshifts, but is not predicted by
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.",2005-05-13T20:26:53Z
"Validation of the Real and Simulated Data of the Pierre Auger
  Fluorescence Telescopes","The fluorescence detector (FD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory is currently
operating 18 fluorescence telescopes of the 24 that will be employed in the
completed detector. These telescopes, grouped in 4 eyes each consisting of 6

duty cycle. The reconstruction capability and triggering efficiency have been
studied using a complete simulation and reconstruction production chain,
employing both simulated CORSIKA showers and parameterised Gaisser-Hillas
profiles. The propagation through the atmosphere and the detector response are
taken into account and simulated in detail. These simulated data have been
generated in a preliminary analysis using the method of importance sampling to
efficiently cover the energy region of 0.3 - 300 EeV, various shower geometries

"Thermal evolution and activity of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 and simulation of a
  deep impact","We use a quasi 3-D thermal evolution model for a spherical comet nucleus,
which takes into account the diurnal and latitudinal variation of the solar
flux, but neglects lateral heat conduction. We model the thermal evolution and
activity of Comet 9P/Tempel 1, in anticipation of the Deep Impact mission
encounter with the comet. We also investigate the possible outcome of a
projectile impact, assuming that all the energy is absorbed as thermal energy.
An interesting result of this investigation, is that the estimated amount of
dust ejected due to the impact is equivalent to 2--2.6 days of activity, during
""quiet"" conditions, at perihelion.
  We show that production rates of volatiles that are released in the interior
of the nucleus depend strongly on the porous structure, in particular on the
surface to volume ratio of the pores. We develop a more accurate model for
calculating this parameter, based on a distribution of pore sizes, rather than
a single, average pore size.",2005-07-01T19:35:09Z
CCD-Delta a and BVR photometry of NGC 7296,"The first CCD photometric investigation of the open cluster NGC 7296 up to

followed, using the standard BVR-Bessel filter set. The age and E(B-V) was
determined independently to log t= 8.0 and 0.15 respectively by using Delta a

ISO's Contribution to the Study of Clusters of Galaxies,"Starting with nearby galaxy clusters like Virgo and Coma, and continuing out
to the furthest galaxy clusters for which ISO results have yet been published
($z=0.56$), we discuss the development of knowledge of the infrared and
associated physical properties of galaxy clusters from early IRAS observations,
through the ""ISO-era"" to the present, in order to explore the status of ISO's
contribution to this field. Relevant IRAS and ISO programmes are reviewed,
addressing both the cluster galaxies and the still-very-limited evidence for an
infrared-emitting intra-cluster medium. ISO made important advances in
knowledge of both nearby and distant galaxy clusters, such as the discovery of
a major cold dust component in Virgo and Coma cluster galaxies, the elaboration
of the correlation between dust emission and Hubble-type, and the detection of
numerous Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) in several distant clusters. These
and consequent achievements are underlined and described. We recall that, due
to observing time constraints, ISO's coverage of higher-redshift galaxy
clusters to the depths required to detect and study statistically significant
samples of cluster galaxies over a range of morphological types could not be
comprehensive and systematic, and such systematic coverage of distant clusters
will be an important achievement of the Spitzer Observatory.",2005-06-17T19:20:27Z
"Astrometric Microlensing Constraints on a Massive Body in the Outer
  Solar System with Gaia","A body in Solar orbit beyond the Kuiper belt exhibits an annual parallax that
exceeds its apparent proper motion by up to many orders of magnitude. Apparent
motion of this body along the parallactic ellipse will deflect the angular
position of background stars due to astrometric microlensing (""induced
parallax""). By synoptically sampling the astrometric position of background
stars over the entire sky, constraints on the existence (and basic properties)
of a massive nearby body may be inferred. With a simple simulation, we estimate
the signal-to-noise for detecting such a body -- as function of mass,
heliocentric distance, and ecliptic latitude -- using the anticipated
sensitivity and temporal cadences from Gaia (launch 2011). A Jupiter-mass
(M_Jup) object at 2000 AU is detectable by Gaia over the whole sky above
5-sigma, with even stronger constraints if it lies near the ecliptic plane.
Hypotheses for the mass (~3M_Jup), distance (~20,000 AU) and location of the
proposed perturber (""Planet X"") which gives rise to long-period comets may be
testable.",2005-06-17T20:41:34Z
"Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems: Cold Outer Disks
  Associated with Sun-like stars","We present the discovery of debris systems around three solar mass stars
based upon observations performed with the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of a
Legacy Science Program, ``the Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems''
(FEPS). We also confirm the presence of debris around two other stars. All the
stars exhibit infrared emission in excess of the expected photospheres in the
70 micron band, but are consistent with photospheric emission at <= 33 micron.
This restricts the maximum temperature of debris in equilibrium with the
stellar radiation to T < 70 K. We find that these sources are relatively old in
the FEPS sample, in the age range 0.7 - 3 Gyr. Based on models of the spectral
energy distributions, we suggest that these debris systems represent materials
generated by collisions of planetesimal belts. We speculate on the nature of
these systems through comparisons to our own Kuiper Belt, and on the likely
planet(s) responsible for stirring the system and ultimately releasing dust
through collisions. We further report observations of a nearby star HD 13974 (d
=11 pc) that is indistinguishable from a bare photosphere at both 24 micron and
70 micron. The observations place strong upper limits on the presence of any
cold dust in this nearby system (L_IR/L_* < 10^{-5.2}).",2005-06-18T00:26:14Z
On constructing horizontal branch models,"We investigate different methods used to construct (zero-age) horizontal
branch models and compare the resulting horizontal branch evolution with that

methods, which are as simple, reproduce the complete evolution very well.",2005-07-19T06:38:07Z
Two new ZZ Ceti pulsators from the HS and HE surveys,"We report the detection of nonradial g-mode oscillations in the DA white
dwarfs HS1039+4112 (B=15.9) and HE1429-0343 (B=15.8) from time-series
photometry made at the Loiano 1.5 m telescope. The two stars were previously
selected as probable pulsators based on two-color photometry and spectral
analysis respectively. Following our temperature and surface gravity
determinations, HS1039+4112 (Teff=11200 K, logg=8.2) is located near the red
edge of the ZZ Ceti instability strip, whereas HE1429-0343 (Teff=11400 K,

behavior with the main periods at about 850 and 970 s respectively, and
relatively large amplitudes (~7% and ~2.5%).",2005-06-10T08:44:43Z
"Neutrino from extragalactic cosmic ray interactions in far infrared
  background","Diffuse background of high energy neutrinos arising from interactions of
cosmic ray protons with far infrared radiation background in extragalactic
space is calculated. It is assumed that cosmic ray spectrum at superhigh
energies has extragalactic origin and is proton dominated.The cosmological
evolution of extragalactic sources of cosmic ray protons as well as
infrared-luminous galaxies is taken into account in the calculation.",2005-07-15T08:44:17Z
"On the fine structure of the sunspot penumbrae. II. The nature of the
  Evershed flow","We investigate the fine structure of the sunspot penumbra by means of a model
that allows for a flux tube in horizontal pressure balance with the magnetic
background atmosphere in which it is embedded. We apply this model to
spectropolarimetric observations of two neutral iron lines at 1.56 $\mu$m and
invert several radial cuts in the penumbra of the same sunspot at two different
heliocentric angles. In the inner part of the penumbra we find hot flux tubes
that are somewhat inclined to the horizontal. They become gradually more
horizontal and cooler with increasing radial distance. This is accompanied by
an increase in the velocity of the plasma and a decrease of the gas pressure
difference between flux tube and the background component. At large radial
distances the flow speed exceeds the critical speed and evidence is found for
the formation of a shock front. These results are in good agreement with
simulations of the penumbral fine structure and provide strong support for the
siphon flow as the physical mechanism driving the Evershed flow.",2005-03-30T21:13:26Z
"Membership of the Orion Nebula Population from the Chandra Orion
  Ultradeep Project","The Chandra Orion Ultradeep project (COUP) observation described in a
companion paper by Getman et al. provides an exceptionally deep X-ray survey of
the Orion Nebula Cluster and associated embedded young stellar objects.
Membership of the region is important for studies of the stellar IMF, cluster
dynamics, and star formation. The COUP study detected 1616 X-ray sources. In
this study we confirm cloud membership for 1315 stars, identify 16 probable
foreground field stars having optical counterparts with discrepant proper
motions, and classify the remaining 285 X-ray sources, of which 51 are lightly
and 234 heavily obscured. The 51 lightly obscured sources without known
counterparts fall into three groups. (i) Sixteen are likely new members of the
Orion Nebula Cluster. (ii) Two with unusually soft and non-flaring X-ray
emission appear to be associated with nebular shocks, and may be new examples
of X-rays produced at the bow shocks of Herbig-Haro outflows. (iii) The
remaining thirty three are very weak uncertain sources, possibly spurious. Out
of 234 heavily absorbed sources without optical or near-infrared counterparts
75 COUP sources are likely new embedded cloud members (with membership for 42
confirmed by powerful X-ray flares), and the remaining 159 are likely
extragalactic AGN seen through the molecular cloud, as argued by a careful
simulation of the extragalactic background population. Finally, a few new
binary companions to Orion stars may have been found, but most cases of
proximate COUP sources can be attributed to chance superpositions in this
crowded field.",2005-04-17T23:54:17Z
Tracing Galaxy Formation with Stellar Halos I: Methods,"If the favored hierarchical cosmological model is correct, then the Milky Way
system should have accreted ~100-200 luminous satellite galaxies in the past
\~12 Gyr. We model this process using a hybrid semi-analytic plus N-body
approach which distinguishes explicitly between the evolution of light and dark
matter in accreted satellites. This distinction is essential to our ability to
produce a realistic stellar halo, with mass and density profile much like that
of our own Galaxy, and a surviving satellite population that matches the
observed number counts and structural parameter distributions of the satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way. Our model stellar halos have density profiles which
typically drop off with radius faster than those of the dark matter. They are
assembled from the inside out, with the majority of mass (~80%) coming from the
\~15 most massive accretion events. The satellites that contribute to the
stellar halo have median accretion times of ~9 Gyr in the past, while surviving
satellite systems have median accretion times of ~5 Gyr in the past. This
implies that stars associated with the inner halo should be quite different
chemically from stars in surviving satellites and also from stars in the outer
halo or those liberated in recent disruption events. We briefly discuss the
expected spatial structure and phase space structure for halos formed in this
manner. Searches for this type of structure offer a direct test of whether
cosmology is indeed hierarchical on small scales.",2005-06-20T19:53:57Z
Supernovae Shedding Light on Gamma-Ray Bursts,"We review the observational status of the Supernova (SN)/Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) connection. In section 2 we provide a short summary of the observational
properties of core-collapse SNe. In sections 3-6 we review the circumstantial
evidences and the direct observations that support the existence of a deep
connection between the death of massive stars and GRBs. Present data suggest
that SNe associated with GRBs form a heterogeneous class of objects including
both bright and faint Hypernovae and perhaps also `standard' Ib/c events. In
section 7, we provide an empirical estimate of the rate of Hypernovae, for a
``MilkyWay-like'' galaxy, of about $\sim 2.6\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ that may
imply the ratio GRB/Hypernovae to be in the range $\sim 0.03-0.7$. In the same
framework we find the ratio GRB/SNe-Ibc to be $\sim 0.008\div 0.05$. In section
8 we discuss the possible existence of a lag between the SN explosion and the
associated gamma-ray event. In the few SN/GRB associations so far discovered
the SN explosions and GRB events appear to go off simultaneously. In section 9
we present the conclusions and highlight the open problems that Swift hopefully
will allow us to solve.",2005-04-23T09:38:11Z
Dynamics of perfect fluid Unified Dark Energy models,"In this paper we show that a \emph{one-to-one} correspondence exists between
any dark energy model and an equivalent (from a cosmological point of view, in
the absence of perturbations) quartessence model in which dark matter and dark
energy are described by a single perfect fluid. We further show that if the
density fluctuations are small, the evolution of the sound speed squared,
$c_s^2$, is fully coupled to the evolution of the scale factor and that the
transition from the dark matter to the dark energy dominated epoch is faster
(slower) than in a standard $\Lambda$CDM model if $c_s^2 > 0$ ($c_s^2 < 0$). In
particular, we show that the mapping of the simplest quintessence scenario with
constant $w_Q \equiv p_Q/ \rho_Q$ into a unified dark energy model requires
$c_s^2 < 0$ at the present time (if $w_Q > -1$) contrasting to the Chaplygin
gas scenario where one has $c_s^2 > 0$. However, we show that non-linear
effects severely complicate the analysis, in particular rendering linear
results invalid even on large cosmological scales. Although a detailed analysis
of non-linear effects requires solving the full Einstein field equations, some
general properties can be understood in simple terms. In particular, we find
that in the context of Chaplygin gas models the transition from the dark matter
to the dark energy dominated era may be anticipated with respect to linear
expectations leading to a background evolution similar to that of standard
$\Lambda$CDM models. On the other hand, in models with $c_s^2 > 0$ the expected
transition from the decelerating to the accelerating phase may never happen.",2005-07-04T16:16:10Z
"The Cross-Correlation between Galaxies and Groups: Probing the Galaxy
  Distribution in and around Dark Matter Haloes","We determine the cross-correlation function between galaxies and galaxy
groups, using both the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We study the cross-correlation as a function
of group mass, and as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass, colour,
spectral type and specific star formation rate of the galaxies. All these
cross-correlation functions show a clear transition from the `1-halo' to the
`2-halo' regimes on a scale comparable to the virial radius of the groups in
consideration. On scales larger than the virial radius, all cross-correlation
functions are roughly parallel, consistent with the linear bias model. In
particular, the large scale correlation amplitudes are higher for more massive
groups, and for brighter and redder galaxies. In the `1-halo' regime, the
cross-correlation function depends strongly on the definition of the group
center. We consider both a luminosity-weighted center (LWC) and a center
defined by the location of the brightest group galaxy (BGC). With the first
definition, the bright early-type galaxies in massive groups are found to be
more centrally concentrated than the fainter, late-type galaxies. Using the
BGC, and excluding the brightest galaxy from the cross correlation analysis, we
only find significant segregation in massive groups ($M \gta
10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$) for galaxies of different spectral types (or colours or
specific star formation rates). In haloes with masses $\la 10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$,
there is a significant deficit of bright satellite galaxies. Comparing the
results from the 2dFGRS with those obtained from realistic mock samples, we
find that the distribution of galaxies in groups is much less concentrated than
dark matter haloes predicted by the current $\Lambda$CDM model. (Abridged)",2005-04-21T17:03:26Z
Dark Matter Haloes and Rotation Curves via Brans-Dicke Theory,"In the present work, the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of gravity is taken as a
possible theory of k-essence. Then starting with the (already known)
Brans-Dicke-Schwarzschild solution which can represent the gravitationally
bound static configurations of the BD scalar k-essence, issues like whether
these configurations can reproduce the observed properties of galactic dark
matter haloes have been addressed. It has been realized that indeed the BD
scalar k-essence can cluster into dark matter halo-like objects with flattened
rotation curves while exhibiting a dark energy-like negative pressure on larger
scales.",2005-07-18T12:42:03Z

results are summarized.",2005-08-11T19:36:03Z
Mass-Varying Neutrinos from a Variable Cosmological Constant,"We consider, in a completely model-independent way, the transfer of energy
between the components of the dark energy sector consisting of the cosmological
constant (CC) and that of relic neutrinos. We show that such a cosmological
setup may promote neutrinos to mass-varying particles, thus resembling a
recently proposed scenario of Fardon, Nelson, and Weiner (FNW), but now without
introducing any acceleronlike scalar fields. Although a formal similarity of
the FNW scenario with the variable CC one can be easily established, one
nevertheless finds different laws for neutrino mass variation in each scenario.
We show that as long as the neutrino number density dilutes canonically, only a
very slow variation of the neutrino mass is possible. For neutrino masses to
vary significantly (as in the FNW scenario), a considerable deviation from the
canonical dilution of the neutrino number density is also needed. We note that
the present `coincidence' between the dark energy density and the neutrino
energy density can be obtained in our scenario even for static neutrino masses.",2005-05-25T10:59:41Z
"Regularized orbit models unveiling the stellar structure and dark matter
  halo of the Coma elliptical NGC 4807","This is the second in a series of papers dedicated to unveil the mass
structure and orbital content of a sample of flattened early-type galaxies in
the Coma cluster. The ability of our orbit libraries to reconstruct internal
stellar motions and the mass composition of a typical elliptical in the sample
is investigated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations of isotropic rotator
models. The simulations allow a determination of the optimal amount of
regularization needed in the orbit superpositions. It is shown that under
realistic observational conditions and with the appropriate regularization
internal velocity moments can be reconstructed to an accuracy of about 15 per
cent; the same accuracy can be achieved for the circular velocity and dark
matter fraction. In contrast, the flattening of the halo remains unconstrained.
Regularized orbit superpositions are applied to a first galaxy in our sample,
NGC 4807, for which stellar kinematical observations extend to 3 Reff. The
galaxy seems dark matter dominated outside 2 Reff. Logarithmic dark matter
potentials are consistent with the data, as well as NFW-profiles, mimicking
logarithmic potentials over the observationally sampled radial range. In both
cases, the derived stellar mass-to-light ratio agrees well with independently
obtained mass-to-light ratios from stellar population analysis. Kinematically,
NGC 4807 is characterized by mild radial anisotropy outside r>0.5 Reff,
becoming isotropic towards the center. Our orbit models hint at either a
distinct stellar component or weak triaxiality in the outer parts of the
galaxy.",2005-04-21T13:26:53Z
Measuring Galaxy Environments with Deep Redshift Surveys,"We study the applicability of several galaxy environment measures
(n^th-nearest-neighbor distance, counts in an aperture, and Voronoi volume)
within deep redshift surveys. Mock galaxy catalogs are employed to mimic
representative photometric and spectroscopic surveys at high redshift (z ~ 1).
We investigate the effects of survey edges, redshift precision, redshift-space
distortions, and target selection upon each environment measure. We find that
even optimistic photometric redshift errors (\sigma_z = 0.02) smear out the
line-of-sight galaxy distribution irretrievably on small scales; this
significantly limits the application of photometric redshift surveys to
environment studies. Edges and holes in a survey field dramatically affect the
estimation of environment, with the impact of edge effects depending upon the
adopted environment measure. These edge effects considerably limit the
usefulness of smaller survey fields (e.g. the GOODS fields) for studies of
galaxy environment. In even the poorest groups and clusters, redshift-space
distortions limit the effectiveness of each environment statistic; measuring
density in projection (e.g. using counts in a cylindrical aperture or a
projected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure) significantly improves the
accuracy of measures in such over-dense environments. For the DEEP2 Galaxy
Redshift Survey, we conclude that among the environment estimators tested the
projected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure provides the most accurate
estimate of local galaxy density over a continuous and broad range of scales.",2005-06-21T23:35:12Z
Exploring Large-scale Structure with Billions of Galaxies,"We consider cosmological applications of galaxy number density correlations
to be inferred from future deep and wide multi-band optical surveys. We mostly
focus on very large scales as a probe of possible features in the primordial
power spectrum. We find the proposed survey of the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope may be competitive with future all-sky CMB experiments over a broad
range of scales. On very large scales the inferred power spectrum is robust to
photometric redshift errors, and, given a sufficient number density of
galaxies, to angular variations in dust extinction and photometric calibration
errors. We also consider other applications, such as constraining dark energy
with the two CMB-calibrated standard rulers in the matter power spectrum, and
controlling the effect of photometric redshift errors to facilitate the
interpretation of cosmic shear data. We find that deep photometric surveys over
wide area can provide constraints that are competitive with spectroscopic
surveys in small volumes.",2005-08-03T23:15:37Z
"The 1 - 50 keV spectral and timing analysis of IGR J18027-2016: an
  eclipsing, high mass X-ray binary","We report the association of the INTEGRAL source IGR J18027-2016 with the
BeppoSAX source SAX J1802.7-2017. IGR J18027-2016 is seen to be a weak,
persistent source by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board INTEGRAL with an
average source count rate of 0.55 counts s^-1 (~6.1 mCrab) in the 20-40 keV
band. Timing analysis performed on the ISGRI data identifies an orbital period
of 4.5696 +/- 0.0009 days and gives an ephemeris of mid-eclipse as, T{mid} =
52931.37 +/- 0.04 MJD. Re-analysis of archival BeppoSAX data has provided a
mass function for the donor star, f(m) = 16 +/- 1 M{sun} and a projected
semimajor axis of a{x}sin{i} = 68 +/- 1 lt-s. We conclude that the donor is an
OB-supergiant with a mass of 18.8-29.3 M{sun} and a radius of 15.0-23.4 R{sun}.
Spectra obtained by XMM-Newton and ISGRI indicate a high hydrogen column
density of NH = 6.8 x 10^22 cm^-2, which suggests intrinsic absorption. The
source appears to be a high mass X-ray binary with the neutron star emitting
X-rays through wind-fed accretion while in an eclipsing orbit around an
OB-supergiant.",2005-05-04T17:13:36Z
Large-Scale Velocity Structures in the Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster,"We present 547 optical redshifts obtained for galaxies in the region of the
Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster (HRS) using the 6dF multi-fiber spectrograph
on the UK Schmidt Telescope at the Anglo Australian Observatory. The HRS covers
an area of more than 12deg x 12deg on the sky centered at approximately RA =
03h19m, DEC = -50deg 02amin. Our 6dF observations concentrate upon the
inter-cluster regions of the HRS, from which we describe four primary results.
First, the HRS spans at least the redshift range from 17,000 to 22,500 km s^-1.
Second, the overdensity of galaxies in the inter-cluster regions of the HRS in
this redshift range is estimated to be 2.4, or del rho/ rho ~ 1.4. Third, we
find a systematic trend of increasing redshift along a Southeast-Northwest
(SE-NW) spatial axis in the HRS, in that the mean redshift of HRS members
increases by more than 1500 km s^-1 from SE to NW over a 12 deg region. Fourth,
the HRS is bi-modal in redshift with a separation of ~ 2500 km s^-1 (35 Mpc)
between the higher and lower redshift peaks. This fact is particularly evident
if the above spatial-redshift trend is fitted and removed. In short, the HRS
appears to consist of two components in redshift space, each one exhibiting a
similar systematic spatial-redshift trend along a SE-NW axis. Lastly, we
compare these results from the HRS with the Shapley supercluster and find
similar properties and large-scale features.",2005-05-17T21:13:37Z
"Variability of Optical \ion{Fe}{ii} Complex in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
  Galaxy NGC 4051","The variability of optical FeII blends in NGC 4051 is examined from spectra
extracted from the AGN Watch program.In our analysis, the FeII complex are
subtracted and measured with the following results. Firstly, the FeII
variations were detected in NGC 4051 during a 3-year period. The identified
FeII variations followed the variations in continuum closely. Secondly, the EW
of FeII is reported to increase with the rising continuum flux, which is
consistent with previous claims that there is no convincing Baldwin Effect in
optical FeII. Thirdly, by comparing the variations of H$\beta$ and FeII, we
find that RFe scales with continuum flux as $\rm{R_{Fe}\propto (5.0\pm0.8)
\log(L/M)}$, which is significantly different from the theoretical
expectations. Finally, in six selected Seyferts, four out of five Narrow-Line
Seyfert 1 galaxies present positive correlation between RFe and the continuum
flux. The negative correlations are identified in the remaindng two objects
that have relatively broad profiles of H$\beta$ ($\rm{FWHM>1500 km\
s^{-1}}$).We argue that the difference of electron density of broad line clouds
and/or variability behavior of incident high-energy radiation can explain the
dichotomy in variability behavior of RFe.",2005-04-05T17:45:26Z
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station,"The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a particle physics detector designed
to operate on the International Space Station (ISS). The aim of AMS is the
direct detection of charged particles in the rigidity range from 0.5 GV to few
TV to perform high statistics studies of cosmic rays in space and search for
antimatter and dark matter. This will be possible because of the large
geometrical acceptance, a very accurate energy determination and a very precise
particle identification through redundant measurements of its energy, velocity
and electric charge. AMS is scheduled to be placed on the ISS at the beginning
of 2008 for a 3 year exposure.",2005-05-20T08:45:37Z
The origin of intergalactic metals around Lyman-break galaxies,"Theoretical and observational arguments suggest that the intergalactic medium
(IGM) might have been polluted with metals produced by early star formation. In
this scenario, Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at redshift z=3 are likely to be
surrounded by old metal bubbles, relics of an era when the characteristic mass
of galaxies was small and gas retainment more difficult. We find that
pregalactic enrichment of the IGM from 10^8-10^{10} M_sun dwarf galaxies at
6<z<12 can quantitatively explain the high cross-correlation between CIV
systems and LBGs observed at z=3. The reason is twofold. First, both LBGs and
high-z dwarfs are biased tracer of the mass distribution and form from
exceptionally high density fluctuations which are strongly clustered. Second,
the action of gravity tends to increase the spatial association between metal
bubbles and LBGs. Our analysis shows that, in order to match the abundance of
CIV systems observed at z=3, the metal bubbles generated by high-z dwarfs must
have comoving sizes of ~100 kpc. We conclude that the observed galaxy-CIV
spatial association needs not to be generated by late ``superwinds'' from LBGs.",2005-04-06T20:00:06Z
Encounters between spherical galaxies II: systems with dark halo,"We performe N-body simulations of encounters between spherical systems
surrounded by a spherical halo. Following a preceding paper with a similar aim,
the initial systems include a spherical Jaffe model for the luminous matter and
a Hernquist model for the halo. The merger remnants from this sample are mainly
slowly rotating, prolate spheroids with a radially anisotropic velocity
distribution. The results are compared with real-life ellipticals and with the
models without halo in paper I. We argue that elliptical galaxies with evidence
of dark matter could be formed in the field via a merger of spheroids
surrounded by a dark matter halo, while ellipticals with no evidence of dark
matter might be formed via a merger of two spheroids in a cluster.",2005-06-01T15:09:35Z
"Gamma-Ray Bursts, Collisionless Shocks and Synthetic Spectra","The radiation from afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) is generated in
collisionless plasma shocks. The two main ingredients behind the radiation are
high-energy, non-thermal electrons and a strong magnetic field. I argue that in
order to make the right conclusions about gamma-ray burst and afterglow
parameters from observations, it is crucial to have a firm understanding of the
microphysics of collisionless shock. I present the results of self-consistent,
three-dimensional particle-in-cell computational simulations of the collision
of weakly magnetized plasma shells: The experiments show how a plasma
instability generates a magnetic field in the shock. The field has strength up
to percents of the equipartition value. The experiments also reveal a new,
non-thermal electron acceleration mechanism that differs substantially from
Fermi acceleration. Finally, I present the results from a new numerical tool
that enables us to extract synthetic radiation spectra directly from the
experiments. The preliminary results differ from synchrotron radiation but are
consistent with GRB afterglow observations. I conclude that strong magnetic
field generation, non-thermal particle acceleration and the emission of
radiation that is consistent with GRB afterglow observations, are all
unavoidable consequences of the collision between two relativistic plasma
shells.",2005-06-23T17:17:51Z
"Fluctuations in the EAS radio signal derived with improved Monte Carlo
  simulations based on CORSIKA","Cosmic ray air showers are known to emit pulsed radio emission which can be
understood as coherent geosynchrotron radiation arising from the deflection of
electron-positron pairs in the earth's magnetic field. Here, we present
simulations carried out with an improved version of our Monte Carlo code for
the calculation of geosynchrotron radiation. Replacing the formerly
analytically parametrised longitudinal air shower development with
CORSIKA-generated longitudinal profiles, we study the radio flux variations
arising from inherent fluctuations between individual air showers.
Additionally, we quantify the dependence of the radio emission on the nature of
the primary particle by comparing the emission generated by proton- and
iron-induced showers. This is only the first step in the incorporation of a
more realistic air shower model into our Monte Carlo code. The inclusion of
highly realistic CORSIKA-based particle energy, momentum and spatial
distributions together with an analytical treatment of ionisation losses will
soon allow simulations of the radio emission with unprecedented detail. This is
especially important to assess the emission strengths at large radial
distances, needed for event-to-event comparisons of the radio signals measured
by LOPES in conjunction with KASCADE-Grande and for considerations regarding
large arrays of radio antennas intended to measure the radio emission from
ultra-high energy cosmic rays, as with LOFAR or in the Pierre Auger
Observatory.",2005-07-01T13:10:48Z
"A Two-Component Explosion Model for the Giant Flare and Radio Afterglow
  from SGR1806-20","The brightest giant flare from the soft $\gamma$-ray repeater (SGR) 1806-20
was detected on 2004 December 27. The isotropic-equivalent energy release of
this burst is at least one order of magnitude more energetic than those of the
two other SGR giant flares. Starting from about one week after the burst, a
very bright ($\sim 80$ mJy), fading radio afterglow was detected. Follow-up
observations revealed the multi-frequency light curves of the afterglow and the
temporal evolution of the source size. Here we show that these observations can
be understood in a two-component explosion model. In this model, one component
is a relativistic collimated outflow responsible for the initial giant flare
and the early afterglow, and another component is a subrelativistic wider
outflow responsible for the late afterglow. We also discuss triggering
mechanisms of these two components within the framework of the magnetar model.",2005-07-14T07:02:57Z
"The ACS Virgo Cluster Survey. VII. Resolving the Connection Between
  Globular Clusters and Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies","We investigate the connection between globular clusters and ultra-compact
dwarf galaxies (UCDs) by examining the properties of several compact objects
associated with M87, all of which were previously classified as globular
clusters. Combining imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope with ground-based
Keck spectroscopy, we find two objects to have half-light radii, velocity
dispersions and mass-to-light ratios that are consistent with the predictions
of population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, luminous globular clusters.
Three other objects are much larger, with half-light radii of approximately
20pc, and have V-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6-9. These objects,
which we consider to be UCDs, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf elliptical
galaxies in Virgo, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities and
colors. These UCDs are found to obey the extrapolated scaling relations of
galaxies more closely than those of Galactic globular clusters. There appears
to be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of about
two million solar masses. If the UCDs are gravitationally bound, then we
suggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental property
distinguishing globular clusters from UCDs. More than half of the UCD
candidates uncovered in the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey are associated with a
single galaxy -- M87 -- which suggests that proximity to the Virgo center may
be of critical importance for the formation of these objects. These results
show that distinguishing bonafide UCDs from bright globular clusters requires a
careful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties,
particularly their mass-to-light ratios. (ABRIDGED)",2005-03-25T18:19:15Z
The VIRMOS deep imaging survey IV: Near-infrared observations,"In this paper we present a new deep, wide-field near-infrared imaging survey.
Our J- and K-band observations in four separate fields complement optical BVRI,
ultraviolet and spectroscopic observations undertaken as part of the VIMOS-VLT
deep survey (VVDS). In total, our survey spans ~400arcmis^2. Our catalogues are
reliable in all fields to at least Kvega~20.75 and Jvega~21.50 (defined as the
magnitude where object contamination is less than 10% and completeness greater
than 90%). Taken together these four fields represents a unique combination of
depth, wavelength coverage and area. We describe the complete data reduction
process and outline a comprehensive series of tests carried out to characterise
the reliability of the final catalogues. We compare the statistical properties
of our catalogues with literature compilations. We find that our J- and
K-selected galaxy counts are in good agreement with previously published works,
as are our (J-K) versus K colour-magnitude diagrams. Stellar number counts
extracted from our fields are consistent with a synthetic model of our galaxy.
Using the location of the stellar locus in colour-magnitude space and the
measured field-to-field variation in galaxy number counts we demonstrate that
the absolute accuracy of our photometric calibration is at the 5% level or
better. Finally, an investigation of the angular clustering of K- selected
extended sources in our survey displays the expected scaling behaviour with
limiting magnitude, with amplitudes in each magnitude bin in broad agreement
with literature values.",2005-07-28T15:24:39Z
High Mass Triple Systems: The Classical Cepheid Y Car,"We have obtained an HST STIS ultraviolet high dispersion Echelle mode
spectrum the binary companion of the double mode classical Cepheid Y Car. The
velocity measured for the hot companion from this spectrum is very different
from reasonable predictions for binary motion, implying that the companion is
itself a short period binary. The measured velocity changed by 7 km/ s during
the 4 days between two segments of the observation confirming this
interpretation. We summarize ""binary"" Cepheids which are in fact members of
triple system and find at least 44% are triples. The summary of information on
Cepheids with orbits makes it likely that the fraction is under-estimated.",2005-04-07T00:33:23Z
A complete view of the broad-line radio galaxy 4C+74.26 with XMM-Newton,"This paper presents a timing study and broadband spectral analysis of the
broad-line radio galaxy 4C+74.26 based on a 35 ks XMM-Newton observation. As
found in previous datasets, the source exhibits no evidence for rapid
variability, and its 0.2-10 keV lightcurve is well fit by a constant. An
excellent fit to the pn 0.3-12 keV spectrum was found using a continuum that
combines an ionized and a neutral reflector, augmented by both cold and warm
absorption. There is no evidence for a soft excess. The column of cold
absorption was greater than the Galactic value with an intrinsic column of
\~1.9\times 10^{21} cm^{-2}. Evidence for the warm absorber was found from O
VII and O VIII absorption edges with maximum optical depths of \tau_{O VII}=0.3
and \tau_{O VIII}=0.03, respectively. A joint pn-MOS fit increased the O VIII
optical depth to \tau_{O VIII}=0.1. A simple, one-zone warm absorber model
yielded a column of ~9\times 10^{20} cm^{-2} and an ionization parameter of
\~60. Partial covering models provide significantly worse fits than ones
including a relativistically broadened Fe K line, strengthening the case for
the existence of such a line. On the whole, the X-ray spectrum of 4C+74.26
exhibits many features typical of both a radio-loud quasar (excess absorption)
and radio-quiet Seyfert~1 galaxies (\fe emission and warm absorption). We also
show that a spurious absorption line at ~8 keV can be created by the
subtraction of an instrumental Cu K\alpha emission line.",2005-06-27T21:16:28Z
Theoretical Isochrones with Extinction in the K Band,"We calculate theoretical isochrones in a consistent way for five filters (K,
K', Ks, F205W, and F222M) in the atmospheric window between 1.9 and 2.5 micron
using the Padova stellar evolutionary models by Girardi et al. Even when
displayed in the same Vega magnitude system, the near-infrared colors of the
same isochrone can differ by up to 0.18 mag at its bright end, depending on the
filter. We present magnitude transformations between K-band filters as a
function of color from H and K band filters. Isochrones with extinction at K of
up to 6 mag are also presented. We find that care is needed when comparing
extinction values that are estimated using different filter sets in the K band,
in particular when comparing those of atmospheric and space filter sets:
extinction values for space filters can be in error by up to 0.3 mag. To reduce
this error, we introduce an ""effective extinction slope"" for each filter set
and isochrone model, which describes the extinction behavior of isochrones in
the color-magnitude diagram more correctly than the actual extinction law. Our
calculation also suggests that the extinction law implied by the observations
of Rieke et al. for wavelengths between the H and K bands is better described
by a power-law function with an exponent of 1.61 instead of 1.55, which is
commonly used with an assumption that the transmission functions of H and K
filters are Dirac delta functions.",2005-05-05T07:10:02Z
Molecular Hydrogen Formation on Porous Dust Grains,"Recent laboratory experiments on interstellar dust analogues have shown that
H_2 formation on dust grain surfaces is efficient in a range of grain
temperatures below 20 K. These results indicate that surface processes may
account for the observed H_2 abundance in cold diffuse and dense clouds.
However, high abundances of H_2 have also been observed in warmer clouds,
including photon-dominated regions (PDRs), where grain temperatures may reach
50 K, making the surface processes extremely inefficient. It was suggested that
this apparent discrepancy can be resolved by chemisorption sites. However,
recent experiments indicate that chemisorption processes may not be efficient
at PDR temperatures. Here we consider the effect of grain porosity on H_2
formation. It is found that porosity extends the efficiency of the
recombination process to higher temperatures. This is because H atoms that
desorb from the internal surfaces of the pores may re-adsorb many times and
thus stay longer on the surface. However, this porosity-driven extension may
enable efficient H_2 formation in PDRs only if porosity also contributes to
significant cooling of the grains, compared to non-porous grains.",2005-06-21T13:23:54Z
"The VLT-UVES survey for molecular hydrogen in high-redshift damped
  Lyman-alpha systems: Physical conditions in the neutral gas","We study the physical conditions in DLAs, using a sample of 33 systems toward
26 QSOs acquired for a recently completed survey of H_2 by Ledoux et al.
(2003). We use the column densities of H_2 in different rotational levels,
together with those of C I, C I*, C I**, C II* and singly ionized atomic
species to discuss the kinetic temperature, the density of hydrogen and the
electronic density in the gas together with the ambient UV radiation field.
Detailed comparisons are made between the observed properties in DLAs, the
interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy, LMC and SMC. The mean kinetic
temperature of the gas corresponding to DLA subcomponents in which H_2
absorption line is detected, derived from the ortho-to-para ratio (153+/-78 K),
is higher than that measured in the ISM (77+/-17 K) and the Magellanic clouds
(82+/-21 K). Typical pressure in these components (corresponding to T = 100-300
K and n = 10-200 cm^-3), measured using C I fine-structure excitation, are
higher than what is measured along ISM sightlines. This is consistent with the
corresponding higher values for N(H_2,J=2)/N(H_2,J=0) seen in DLAs. From the
column densities of the high-J rotational levels, we derive that the typical
radiation field in the H_2 bearing components is of the order of or slightly
higher than the mean UV field in the Galactic ISM. Determination of electron
density in the gas with H_2 and C I show the ionization rate is similar to that
of a cold neutral medium (CNM) in a moderate radiation field. This, together
with the fact that we see H_2 in 13-20% of the DLAs, can be used to conclude
that DLAs at z>1.9 could contribute as much as 50% star formation rate density
seen in Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). (Abridged)",2005-06-23T09:20:11Z
"Tracing the X-ray emitting intra-cluster medium of clusters of galaxies
  beyond r_200","(Abridged) We present in this paper a sample of 14 nearby clusters of
galaxies observed with the ROSAT/PSPC. We only select clusters with low
galactic nH in order to trace the X-ray emitting intra-cluster medium (ICM) out
to large radii. We convert the X-ray surface brightness profiles of the
clusters into emission measure profiles scaled to the classical scaling
relations based on the spherical collapse model. We sort the clusters into
different temperature bins and stack the scaled emission measure (ScEM)
profiles of clusters together. The stacked profiles allow us to observe out to
radii r>r_200. In the center we find that the ScEM profiles deviate from
predicted scaling laws. This result is in very good agreement with current
studies on the L_X-T relation and the entropy - temperature relation (S \propto
T^0.65) found recently. At radii r>0.4r_200 we find that the ScEM profiles
agree well within the error bars, suggesting self-similarity. Fitting
beta-models to the overall ScEM profiles we find for the different sub samples
r_c=0.15-0.18 r_200 and beta=0.8, which is higher than beta=2/3 often found.
The beta-model is generally a better representation for hotter than for cooler
clusters. We see indications for continuous steepening of the profiles with
increasing radius: at radii r>0.8r_200 the profiles are systematically below
the beta-model curve with beta=0.8. We discuss our results with respect to the
observed X-ray luminosity L_X-T relation, the gas mass M_gas-T relation and the
total mass M-T relation. We also address implications on the origin of the
observed S-T relation. Furthermore we discuss the observed steepness of the
X-ray profiles, which falls off more rapidly than predicted from the
NFW-profile for cold dark matter halos.",2005-05-03T06:41:11Z
A unified model for black hole X-ray binary jets ?,"We have recently put forward a 'unified' semi-empirical model for the
coupling between accretion and jet production in galactic black hole X-ray
binaries (published in MNRAS, 2004). In this paper we summarise this model and
briefly discuss relevant considerations which have arisen since its
publication.",2005-06-20T20:10:40Z
"Discovery of Three Wide-orbit Binary Pulsars: Implications for Binary
  Evolution and Equivalence Principles","We report the discovery of three binary millisecond pulsars during the Parkes
Multibeam Pulsar Survey of the Galactic Plane. The objects are highly recycled
and are in orbits of many tens of days about low-mass white-dwarf companions.
The eccentricity of one object, PSR J1853+1303, is more than an order of
magnitude lower than predicted by the theory of convective fluctuations during
tidal circularization. We demonstrate that, under the assumption that the
systems are randomly oriented, current theoretical models of the
core-mass--orbital-period relation for the progenitors of these systems likely
overestimate the white-dwarf masses, strengthening previous concerns about the
match of these models to the data. The new objects allow us to update the
limits on violation of relativistic equivalence principles to 95% confidence
upper limits of 5.6 x 10^-3 for the Strong Equivalence Principle parameter
Delta and 4.0 x 10^-20 for the Lorentz-invariance/momentum-conservation

A very extended reionization epoch ?,"The recent observations of cross temperature-polarization power spectra of
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) made by the WMAP satellite are in better
agreement with a high value of the Thomson scattering optical depth \tau
\approx 0.17. This value is close to \tau = 0.3, which is taken as the upper
limit in the parameter extraction analysis made by the WMAP team. However,
models with \tau \sim 0.3 provide a good fit to current CMB data and are not
significantly excluded when combined with Large Scale Structure data. By making
use of a self-consistent reionization model, we verify the astrophysical
feasibility of models with \tau \sim 0.3. It turns out that current data on
various observations related to the thermal and ionization history of the
intergalactic medium are not able to rule out \tau \sim 0.3. The possibility of
a very extended reionization epoch can significantly undermine the WMAP
constraints on crucial cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, the
spectral index of primordial fluctuations and the amplitude of dark matter
clustering.",2005-06-21T11:38:42Z
"Early and Rapid Merging as a Formation Mechanism of Massive Galaxies:
  Empirical Constraints","We present the results of a series of empirical computations regarding the
role of major mergers in forming the stellar masses of modern galaxies based on
measurements of galaxy merger and star formation histories from z~0.5-3. We
re-construct the merger history of normal field galaxies from z~3 to z~0 as a
function of initial mass using published pair fractions and merger fractions
from structural analyses. We calibrate the observed merger time-scale and mass
ratios for galaxy mergers using self-consistent N-body models of mergers,
composed of dark matter and stars, with mass ratios from 1:1 to 1:5 with
various orbital properties and viewing angles. We use these simulations to
determine the time-scales and mass ratios that produce structures that would be
identified as major mergers. Based on these calculations we argue that a
typical massive galaxy at z~3 with M_{*} > 10^{10} M_0 undergoes
4.4^{+1.6}_{-0.9} major mergers at z > 1. We find that by z~1.5 the stellar
mass of an average massive galaxy is relatively established, a scenario
qualitatively favored in a lambda dominated universe. We argue that the final
masses of these systems increases by as much as a factor of 100 allowing
Lyman-break galaxies, which tend to have low stellar masses, to become the most
massive galaxies in today's universe with M > M^{*}. Induced star formation
however only accounts for 10-30% of the stellar mass formed in these galaxies
at z < 3. A comparison to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation shows that
Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models consistently under-predict the merger fraction,
and rate of merging, of massive galaxies at high redshift. This suggests that
massive galaxy formation occurs through more merging than predicted in CDM
models, rather than a rapid early collapse.",2005-07-06T20:00:33Z
HST Imaging of MEGA Microlensing Candidates in M31,"We investigate $HST$/ACS and WFPC2 images at the positions of five candidate
microlensing events from a large survey of variability in M31 (MEGA). Three
closely match unresolved sources, and two produce only flux upper limits. All
are confined to regions of the color-magnitude diagram where stellar
variability is unlikely to be easily confused with microlensing. Red variable
stars cannot explain these events (although background supernova are possible
for two). If these lenses arise in M31's halo, they are due to masses $0.15 < m
/ M_\odot < 0.49$ (95% certainty, for a $\delta$-function mass distribution),
brown dwarfs for disk lenses, and stellar masses for bulge lenses.",2005-07-12T13:46:02Z
"Supernova Remnants in the Magellanic Clouds. V. The Complex Interior
  Structure of the N206 SNR","The N206 supernova remnant (SNR) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has long
been considered a prototypical ""mixed morphology"" SNR. Recent observations,
however, have added a new twist to this familiar plot: an elongated,
radially-oriented radio feature seen in projection against the SNR face.
Utilizing the high resolution and sensitivity available with the Hubble Space
Telescope, Chandra, and XMM-Newton, we have obtained optical emission-line
images and spatially resolved X-ray spectral maps for this intriguing SNR. Our
findings present the SNR itself as a remnant in the mid to late stages of its
evolution. X-ray emission associated with the radio ""linear feature"" strongly
suggests it to be a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN). A small X-ray knot is discovered
at the outer tip of this feature. The feature's elongated morphology and the
surrounding wedge-shaped X-ray enhancement strongly suggest a bow-shock PWN
structure.",2005-04-27T17:53:55Z
"A Computational Guide to Physics of Eclipsing Binaries. Paper I.
  Demonstrations and Perspectives","PHOEBE (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs) is a modeling package for eclipsing
binary stars, built on top of the widely used WD program (Wilson & Devinney
1971). This introductory paper overviews most important scientific extensions
(incorporating observational spectra of eclipsing binaries into the
solution-seeking process, extracting individual temperatures from observed
color indices, main-sequence constraining and proper treatment of the
reddening), numerical innovations (suggested improvements to WD's Differential
Corrections method, the new Nelder & Mead's downhill Simplex method) and
technical aspects (back-end scripter structure, graphical user interface).
While PHOEBE retains 100% WD compatibility, its add-ons are a powerful way to
enhance WD by encompassing even more physics and solution reliability. The
operability of all these extensions is demonstrated on a synthetic
main-sequence test binary; applications to real data will be published in
follow-up papers. PHOEBE is released under the GNU General Public License,
which guarranties it to be free, open to anyone interested to join in on future

"Oxygen and neon abundances of planetary nebulae in the elliptical galaxy
  NGC 4697","This paper presents deep spectra of 14 planetary nebulae (PNs) at a variety
of angular distances from the center of the flattened elliptical galaxy NGC
4697. Both near the center and among the most outlying PNs we have found
several examples of very strong [O III] 5007, about 20 times brighter than
Hbeta. This, together with strong [Ne III] lines, implies a lower limit for O
and Ne abundances near solar at the center and also at more than two effective
radii from the center of NGC 4697. Thus we have found, for the first time from
individual stars, direct evidence of the existence of a metal-rich population
in elliptical galaxies, confirming metallicities derived from absorption-line
indices and extending the information to angular distances where the stellar
surface brightness is too low for absorption-line studies. A comparison with
abundances obtained closer to the center of NGC 4697 from integrated
absorption-line spectra indicates that the metallicity gradient, which is quite
steep within one effective radius, becomes much less pronounced beyond one
effective radius. The only alternative to this interpretation would be the
presence of a very metal-poor PN population with [Z/H] below -1, which we
cannot rule out but would require an extremely bimodal metallicity distribution
with almost no intermediate metallicities.",2005-03-29T05:00:41Z
Dynamics of perfect fluid Unified Dark Energy models,"In this paper we show that a \emph{one-to-one} correspondence exists between
any dark energy model and an equivalent (from a cosmological point of view, in
the absence of perturbations) quartessence model in which dark matter and dark
energy are described by a single perfect fluid. We further show that if the
density fluctuations are small, the evolution of the sound speed squared,
$c_s^2$, is fully coupled to the evolution of the scale factor and that the
transition from the dark matter to the dark energy dominated epoch is faster
(slower) than in a standard $\Lambda$CDM model if $c_s^2 > 0$ ($c_s^2 < 0$). In
particular, we show that the mapping of the simplest quintessence scenario with
constant $w_Q \equiv p_Q/ \rho_Q$ into a unified dark energy model requires
$c_s^2 < 0$ at the present time (if $w_Q > -1$) contrasting to the Chaplygin
gas scenario where one has $c_s^2 > 0$. However, we show that non-linear
effects severely complicate the analysis, in particular rendering linear
results invalid even on large cosmological scales. Although a detailed analysis
of non-linear effects requires solving the full Einstein field equations, some
general properties can be understood in simple terms. In particular, we find
that in the context of Chaplygin gas models the transition from the dark matter
to the dark energy dominated era may be anticipated with respect to linear
expectations leading to a background evolution similar to that of standard
$\Lambda$CDM models. On the other hand, in models with $c_s^2 > 0$ the expected
transition from the decelerating to the accelerating phase may never happen.",2005-07-04T16:16:10Z
"Extending the Search for Counterrotating Gas and Stars in Galaxies: A
  Study of Late-Type Dwarfs","In a previous study on gas-stellar counterrotation for a large sample of E/S0
and spiral galaxies (Kannappan & Fabricant 2001), two dwarf irregular galaxies
were included, of which one was tentatively identified as a counterrotator.
Here we extend the search for counterrotation to include 10 more
irregular/spiral dwarf galaxies. We find that all systems with well defined gas
and stellar rotation show kinematics consistent with co-rotation. However, we
see evidence of decoupled gas and stellar kinematics in >~ 50% of the sample,
possibly reflecting minor interactions too small to create large-scale
gas-stellar counterrotation.",2005-07-21T06:07:34Z
Constraints on supernovae dimming from photon-pseudo scalar coupling,"An alternative mechanism that dims high redshift supernovae without cosmic
acceleration utilizes an oscillation of photons into a pseudo-scalar particle
during transit. Since angular diameter distance measures are immune to the loss
of photons, this ambiguity in interpretation can be resolved by combining CMB
acoustic peak measurements with the recent baryon oscillation detection in
galaxy power spectra. This combination excludes a non-accelerating dark energy
species at the 4sigma level regardless of the level of the pseudo-scalar
coupling. While solutions still exist with substantial non-cosmological dimming
of supernovae, they may be tested with future improvement in baryon oscillation
experiments.",2005-07-29T20:55:36Z
The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on the Swift MIDEX Mission,"The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is one of 3 instruments on the Swift MIDEX
spacecraft to study gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The BAT first detects the GRB and
localizes the burst direction to an accuracy of 1-4 arcmin within 20 sec after
the start of the event. The GRB trigger initiates an autonomous spacecraft slew
to point the two narrow field-of-view (FOV) instruments at the burst location
within 20-70 sec so to make follow-up x-ray and optical observations. The BAT
is a wide-FOV, coded-aperture instrument with a CdZnTe detector plane. The
detector plane is composed of 32,768 pieces of CdZnTe (4x4x2mm), and the
coded-aperture mask is composed of approximately 52,000 pieces of lead
(5x5x1mm) with a 1-m separation between mask and detector plane. The BAT
operates over the 15-150 keV energy range with approximately 7 keV resolution,
a sensitivity of approximately 10E-8 erg*cm^-2*s^-1, and a 1.4 sr (half-coded)
FOV. We expect to detect >100 GRBs/yr for a 2-year mission. The BAT also
performs an all-sky hard x-ray survey with a sensitivity of approximately 2
mCrab (systematic limit) and it serves as a hard x-ray transient monitor.",2005-07-18T14:37:43Z
"The Birthplace of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Field Versus Globular Cluster
  Populations","Recent Chandra studies of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) within early-type
galaxies have found that LMXBs are commonly located within globular clusters of
the galaxies. However, whether all LMXBs are formed within globular clusters
has remained an open question. If all LMXBs formed within globular clusters,
the summed X-ray luminosity of the LMXBs in a galaxy should be directly
proportional to the number of globular clusters in the galaxy regardless of
where the LMXBs currently reside. We have compared these two quantities over
the same angular area for a sample of 12 elliptical and S0 galaxies observed
with Chandra and found that the correlation between the two quantities is
weaker than expected if all LMXBs formed within globular clusters. This
indicates that a significant number of the LMXBs were formed in the field, and
naturally accounts for the spread in field-to-cluster fractions of LMXBs from
galaxy to galaxy. We also find that the ""pollution"" of globular cluster LMXBs
into the field has been minimal within elliptical galaxies, but there is
evidence that roughly half of the LMXBs originally in the globular clusters of
S0 galaxies in our sample have escaped into the field. This is due to higher
globular cluster disruption rates in S0s resulting from stronger gravitational
shocks caused by the passage of globular clusters through the disks of S0
galaxies that are absent in elliptical galaxies.",2005-06-09T20:00:04Z
The phase-space distribution of infalling dark matter subhalos,"We use high-resolution numerical simulations to study the physical properties
of subhalos when they merge into their host halos. An improved algorithm is
used to identify the subhalos. We then examine their spatial and velocity
distributions in spherical and triaxial halo models. We find that the accretion
of satellites preferentially occurs along the major axis and perpendicular to
the spin axis of the host halo. Furthermore, the massive subhalos show a
stronger preference to be accreted along the major axis of the host halo than
the low-mass ones. Approximate fitting formulae are provided for the physical
properties of subhalos. Combined with analytical and semi-analytic techniques,
these empirical formulae provide a useful basis for studying the subsequent
evolution of subhalos and satellite galaxies in their hosts. Future studies
should however account for satellites that may not be undergoing the first
infall in their evolution.",2005-05-08T02:19:38Z
"Near Infrared Surface Properties of the Two Intrinsically Brightest
  Minor Planets (90377) Sedna and (90482) Orcus","We present low resolution K band spectra taken at the Gemini 8 meter
telescope of (90377) Sedna and (90482) Orcus (provisional designations 2003
VB12 and 2004 DW, respectively), currently the two minor planets with the
greatest absolute magnitudes (i.e. the two most reflective minor planets). We
place crude limits on the surface composition of these two bodies using a Hapke
model for a wide variety of assumed albedos. The unusual minor planet (90377)
Sedna was discovered on November 14, 2003 UT at roughly 90 AU with 1.6 times
the heliocentric distance and perihelion distance of any other bound minor
planet. It is the first solar system object discovered between the Kuiper Belt
and the Oort Cloud, and may represent a transition population between the two.
The reflectance spectrum of (90377) Sedna appears largely featureless at the
current signal-to-noise ratio, suggesting a surface likely to be highly
processed by cosmic rays. For large grain models (100 micron to 1 cm) we find
that (90377) Sedna must have less than 70% surface fraction of water ice and
less than 60% surface fraction of methane ice to 3 sigma confidence. Minor
planet (90482) Orcus shows strong water ice absorption corresponding to less
than 50% surface fraction for grain models 25 micron and larger. Orcus cannot
have more than 30% of its surface covered by large (100 mm to 1 cm) methane
grains to 3 sigma confidence.",2005-04-12T20:00:27Z
"Probing the cosmic microwave background temperature using the
  Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect","We discuss the possibility to constrain the relation between redshift and
temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using multifrequency
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations. We have simulated a catalog of clusters of
galaxies detected through their SZ signature assuming the sensitivities that
will be achieved by the {\it Planck} satellite at 100, 143 and 353 GHz, taking
into account the instrumental noise and the contamination from the Cosmic
Infrared Background and from unresolved radiosources. We have parametrized the
cosmological temperature-redshift law as $T\propto (1+z)^{(1-a)}$. Using two
sets of SZ flux density ratios (100/143 GHz, which is most sensitive to the
parametrization of the $T-z$ law, and 143/353 GHz, which is most sensitive to
the peculiar velocities of the clusters) we show that it is possible to recover
the $T-z$ law assuming that the temperatures and redshifts of the clusters are
known. From a simulated catalog of $\sim 1200$ clusters, the parameter $a$ can
be recovered to an accuracy of 10$^{-2}$. Sensitive SZ observations thus appear
as a potentially useful tool to test the standard law. Most cosmological models
predict a linear variation of the CMB temperature with redshift. The discovery
of an alternative law would have profound implications on the cosmological
model, implying creation of energy in a manner that would still maintain the
black-body shape of the CMB spectrum at redshift zero.",2005-07-01T16:14:58Z
Galactic Centre stellar winds and Sgr A* accretion,"(ABRIDGED) We present in detail our new 3D numerical models for the accretion
of stellar winds on to Sgr A*. In our most sophisticated models, we put stars
on realistic orbits around Sgr A*, include `slow' winds (300 km/s), and account
for radiative cooling. We first model only one phase `fast' stellar winds (1000
km/s). For wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is Mdot ~ 1e-5
Msun/yr, fluctuates by < 10%, and is in a good agreement with previous models.
In contrast, Mdot decreases by an order of magnitude for stars following
circular orbits, and fluctuates by ~ 50%. Then we allow a fraction of stars to
produce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively, forming cold clumps
immersed into the X-ray emitting gas. We test two orbital configurations for
the stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs
with perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive
to the orbits. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, with an
almost constant Mdot ~ 3e-6 Msun/yr, consistent with Chandra observations. The
cold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful episodes which may give
rise to large amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time scales
of 10s to 100s of years. The circularisation radii for the flows are ~ 1e3 and
1e4 Rsch, for the one and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never
forming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work.
Our work suggests that, averaged over time scales of 100s to 1000s of years,
the radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher
than it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion
modelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the
wind properties and stellar orbits.",2005-05-18T17:06:44Z
"Measuring the Halo Mass of z=3 Damped Ly-alpha Absorbers from the
  Absorber-Galaxy Cross-correlation","[Abridged] We test the reliability of a method to measure the mean halo mass
of Damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs). The method is based on measuring the ratio
of the cross-correlation between DLAs and galaxies to the auto-correlation of
the galaxies themselves ($w_{\rm dg}/w_{\rm gg}$), which is (in linear theory)
the ratio of their bias factor. This is shown to be true irrespective of the
galaxy redshift distribution, provided that one uses the same galaxies for the
two correlation functions. The method is applicable to all redshifts. Here, we
focus on z=3 DLAs and we demonstrate that the method robustly constrains the
mean DLA halo mass using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) cosmological
simulations. If we use the bias formalism of Mo & White with the DLA and galaxy
mass distributions of these simulations, we predict a bias ratio of 0.771.
Direct measurement from the simulations of $w_{\rm dg}/w_{\rm gg}$ st yields a
ratio of 0.73+/-0.08, in excellent agreement with that prediction.
Equivalently, inverting the measured correlation ratio to infer a mean DLA halo
mass yields (log. averaging, in solar units) <log(M_DLA)> =11.13+/-013, in
excellent agreement with the true value in the simulations: 11.16. The cross-
correlation method thus appears to yield a robust estimate of the average host
halo mass even though the DLAs and the galaxies occupy a broad mass spectrum of
halos, and massive halos contain multiple galaxies with DLAs. We show that the
inferred mean DLA halo mass is independent of the galaxy sub-sample used, i.e.
the cross-correlation technique is also reliable. Our results imply that the
cross-correlation length between DLAs and LBGs is predicted to be, at most,
2.85 Mpc. Future observations will soon distinguish models in which DLAs are in
low mass halos from those in which DLAs are in massive halos.",2005-04-07T08:52:57Z
"Distance determinations using type II supernovae and the expanding
  photosphere method","Due to their high intrinsic brightness, type II supernovae (SN) can be used
as lighthouses to constrain distances in the Universe using variants of the
Baade-Wesselink method. Based on a large set of CMFGEN models (Hillier & Miller
1998) covering the photospheric phase of type II SN, we study the various
concepts entering one such technique, the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM).
We compute correction factors $\xi$ needed to approximate the synthetic
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) with that of a blackbody at temperature $T$.
Our $\xi$, although similar, are systematically greater, by $\sim 0.1$, than
the values obtained by Eastman et al. (1996). This translate into a systematic
enhancement of 10-20% in EPM-distances. We find that line emission and
absorption, not directly linked to color temperature variations, can
considerably alter the synthetic magnitude, and cause above-unity $\xi$-values.
Optically-thick lines, present in the optical at late-times, can also introduce
a strong wavelength-dependence of the photospheric radius, invalidating the use
of the Baade method. Both the impact of line-blanketing on the SED and the
photospheric radius at low $T$ suggest that the EPM is best used at early
times, when the outflow is fully ionized and line-opacity mostly confined to
the UV range. We also investigate how reliably one can measure the photospheric
velocity from P-Cygni line profiles. Contrary to the usually held belief, the
velocity at maximum absorption in the P-Cygni trough of optically-thick lines
can both {\it overestimate or underestimate} the photospheric velocity, with a
magnitude that depends on the SN outflow density gradient and the optical
thickness of the line.",2005-05-23T02:18:30Z
Hydrogen Burning of 17-O in Classical Novae,"We report on the observation of a previously unknown resonance at
E=194.1+/-0.6 keV (lab) in the 17-O(p,alpha)14-N reaction, with a measured
resonance strength omega_gamma(p,alpha)=1.6+/-0.2 meV. We studied in the same
experiment the 17-O(p,gamma)18-F reaction by an activation method and the
resonance-strength ratio was found to be
omega_gamma(p,alpha)/omega_gamma(p,gamma)=470+/-50. The corresponding
excitation energy in the 18-F compound nucleus was determined to be
5789.8+/-0.3 keV by gamma-ray measurements using the 14-N(alpha,gamma)18-F
reaction. These new resonance properties have important consequences for 17-O
nucleosynthesis and gamma-ray astronomy of classical novae.",2005-06-21T17:05:19Z
"First and second-type self-similar solutions of implosions and
  explosions containing ultra-relativistic shocks","We derive self similar solutions for ultra-relativistic shock waves
propagating into cold material of powerlaw density profile in radius rho ~
r^-k. We treat both implosions and explosions in three geometries: planar,
cylindrical and spherical. For spherical explosions these are the first type
solutions of Blandford and McKee for k<4 and the second type solutions found by
Best and Sari for k>5-sqrt(3/4). In addition we find new, hollow (with
evacuated interior), first type solutions that may be applicable for 4<k<17/4.
This ``sequence'' with increasing k of first type solutions, hollow first type
solutions, and then second type solutions is reminiscent of the
non-relativistic sequence. However, while in the non relativistic case there is
a range of k which corresponds to a ``gap'' - a range in $k$ with neither first
nor second type solutions which separates the hollow first type solutions and
the second type solutions, here there is an ``overlap'': a range of k for which
current considerations allow for both hollow first and second type solutions.
Further understanding is needed to determine which of the two solutions apply
in this overlap regime. We provide similar exploration for the other geometries
and for imploding configurations. Interestingly, we find a gap for imploding
spherical shocks and exploding planar shocks and an overlap for imploding
planar solutions. Cylindrical configurations have no hollow solutions and
exhibit direct transition from first type to second type solutions, without a
gap or an overlap region.",2005-05-09T21:02:18Z
"VLTI/MIDI measurements of extended mid-infrared emission in the Galactic
  Center","We investigated with MIDI the extension of dusty mid-infrared excess sources
(IRS 1W, IRS 10W, IRS 2, IRS 8) in immediate vicinity to the black hole (BH) at
the GC. We derive 3$\sigma$ upper limits of the correlated fluxes of our target
sources which give direct constraints on the size of the emitting regions. Most
probably the emission originates from bow shocks generated by windy stars
ploughing through the dense matter of the Northern MiniSpiral.",2005-05-25T14:30:46Z
"The location of the broad HI absorption in 3C305: clear evidence for a
  jet-accelerated neutral outflow","We present high-spatial resolution 21-cm HI VLA observations of the radio
galaxy 3C305 (z=0.041). These new high-resolution data show that the ~1000 km/s
broad HI absorption, earlier detected in low-resolution WSRT observations, is
occurring against the bright, eastern radio lobe, about 1.6 kpc from the
nucleus. We use new optical spectra taken with the WHT to make a detailed
comparison of the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen with that of the ionised
gas. The striking similarity between the complex kinematics of the two gas
phases suggests that both the ionised gas and the neutral gas are part of the
same outflow. Earlier studies of the ionised gas had already found evidence for
a strong interaction between the radio jet and the interstellar medium at the
location of the eastern radio lobe. Our results show that the fast outflow
produced by this interaction also contains a component of neutral atomic
hydrogen. The most likely interpretation is that the radio jet ionises the ISM
and accelerates it to the high outflow velocities observed. Our observations
demonstrate that, following this strong jet-cloud interaction, not all gas
clouds are destroyed and that part of the gas can cool and become neutral. The
mass outflow rate measured in 3C~305 is comparable, although at the lower end
of the distribution, to that found in Ultra-Luminous IR galaxies. This suggests
that AGN-driven outflows, and in particular jet-driven outflows, can have a
similar impact on the evolution of a galaxy as starburst-driven superwinds.",2005-05-18T07:45:59Z
"On the Eccentricities and Merger Rates of Double Neutron Star Binaries
  and the Creation of ""Double Supernovae""","We demonstrate that a natural consequence of an asymmetric kick imparted to
neutron stars at birth is that the majority of double neutron star binaries
should possess highly eccentric orbits. This leads to greatly accelerated
orbital decay, due to the enormous increase in the emission of gravitational
radiation at periastron as originally demonstrated by Peters (1964). A uniform
distribution of kick velocities constrained to the orbital plane would result
in ~24% of surviving binaries coalescing at least 10,000 times faster than an
unperturbed circular system. Even if the planar kick constraint is lifted, ~6%
of bound systems still coalesce this rapidly. In a non-negligible fraction of
cases it may even be possible that the system could coalesce within 10 years of
the final supernova, resulting in what we might term a ""double supernova''. For
systems resembling the progenitor of PSR J0737-3039A, this number is as high as
\~9% (in the planar kick model). Whether the kick velocity distribution extends
to the range required to achieve this is still unclear. We do know that the
observed population of binary pulsars has a deficit of highly eccentric systems
at small orbital periods. In contrast, the long-period systems favour large
eccentricities, as expected. We argue that this is because the short-period
highly eccentric systems have already coalesced and are thus selected against
by pulsar surveys. This effect needs to be taken into account when using the
scale-factor method to estimate the coalescence rate of double neutron star
binaries. We therefore assert that the coalesence rate of such binaries is
underestimated by a factor of several.",2005-04-01T12:01:33Z
A variability study of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6300 with XMM-Newton,"We present the results of timing analysis of the XMM-Newton observation of
the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6300. The hard X-ray spectrum above 2 keV consists of
a Compton-thin-absorbed power law, as is often seen in Seyfert 2 galaxies. We
clearly detected rapid time variability on a time scale of about 1000 s from
the light curve above 2 keV. The excess variance of the time variability
(sigma2_RMS) is calculated to be ~0.12, and the periodogram of the light curve
is well represented by a power law function with a slope of 1.75. In contrast
with previous results from Seyfert 2 nuclei, these variability characteristics
are consistent with those of Seyfert 1 galaxies. This consistency suggests that
NGC 6300 has a similar black hole mass and accretion properties as Seyfert 1
galaxies. Using the relation between time variability and central black hole
mass by Hayashida et al. (1998), the black hole mass of NGC 6300 is estimated
to be ~2.8x10^5 Mo. Taking uncertainty of this method into account, the black
hole mass is less than 10^7 Mo. Taking the bolometric luminosity of 3.3x10^43
erg/s into consideration, this yields an accretion rate of > 0.03 of the
Eddington value, and comparable with estimates from Seyfert 1 galaxies using
this method. The time variability analysis suggests that NGC 6300 actually has
a Seyfert 1 nucleus obscured by a thick matter, and more generally provides a
new pillar of support for the unified model of Seyfert galaxies based on
obscuration.",2005-07-20T07:12:31Z
Do Black Holes Produce Phantom Energy?,"We conjecture that black holes, whether accreting matter or not, can also
lose mass to phantom energy production. Such a process can be made plausible in
theories that allow for non-local connections between short and long wavelength
modes. If true, observational data should show an exchange of energy from
matter to phantom at some cosmic epoch, and we discuss a simple model. Some
remarks on an appropriate quantum gravity theory and related issues are also
presented.",2005-03-15T19:16:33Z
"Induced two-photon decay of the 2s level and the rate of cosmological
  hydrogen recombination","Induced emission due to the presence of soft CMB photons slightly increases
the two-photon decay rate of the 2s level of hydrogen defining the rate of
cosmological recombination. This correspondingly changes the degree of
ionization, the visibility function and the resulting primordial temperature
anisotropies and polarization of the CMB on the percent level. These changes
exceed the precision of the widely used CMBFAST and CAMB codes by more than one
order of magnitude and can be easily taken into account.",2005-08-04T20:08:18Z
Ultra-Low Amplitude Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"The MACHO variables of LMC Field 77 that lie in the vicinity of the Cepheid
instability strip are reexamined. Among the 144 variables that we identify as
Cepheids we find 14 that have Fourier amplitudes <0.05 mag in the MACHO red
band, of which 7 have an amplitude <0.006 mag : we dub the latter group of
stars ultra-low amplitude (ULA) Cepheids. The variability of these objects is
verified by a comparison of the MACHO red with the MACHO blue lightcurves and
with those of the corresponding OGLE LMC stars. The occurrence of ULA Cepheids
is in agreement with theory. We have also discovered 2 low amplitude variables
whose periods are about a factor of 5--6 smaller than those of F Cepheids of
equal apparent magnitude. We suggest that these objects are Cepheids undergoing
pulsations in a surface mode and that they belong to a novel class of Strange
Cepheids (or Surface Mode Cepheids) whose existence was predicted by Buchler et
al. (1997).",2005-06-06T15:38:41Z
Representations of spectral coordinates in FITS,"Greisen & Calabretta describe a generalized method for specifying the
coordinates of FITS data samples. Following that general method, Calabretta &
Greisen describe detailed conventions for defining celestial coordinates as
they are projected onto a two-dimensional plane. The present paper extends the
discussion to the spectral coordinates of wavelength, frequency, and velocity.
World coordinate functions are defined for spectral axes sampled linearly in
wavelength, frequency, or velocity, linearly in the logarithm of wavelength or
frequency, as projected by ideal dispersing elements, and as specified by a
lookup table.",2005-07-12T16:26:48Z
"Metal abundances of RR Lyrae stars in the metal rich globular cluster
  NGC 6441","Low resolution spectra have been used to measure individual metal abundances
of RR Lyrae stars in NGC 6441, a Galactic globular cluster known to have very
unusual horizontal branch morphology and periods of the RR Lyrae stars for its
high metallicity. We find an average metal abundance of [Fe/H]=-0.69 +/- 0.06
(r.m.s.=0.33 dex) and [Fe/H]=-0.41 +/- 0.06 (r.m.s.=0.36 dex) on Zinn & West
and Carretta & Gratton metallicity scales, respectively, consistent with the
cluster metal abundance derived by Armandroff & Zinn. Most of the metallicities
were extrapolated from calibration relations defined for [Fe/H] < -1; however,
they are clearly high and contrast with the rather long periods of the NGC 6441
variables, thus confirming that the cluster does not fit in the general
Oosterhoff classification scheme. The r.m.s. scatter of the average is larger
than observational errors (0.15-0.16 dex) possibly indicating some spread in
metallicity. However, even the metal poor variables, if confirmed to be cluster
members, are still more metal rich than those commonly found in the Oosterhoff
type II globular clusters.",2005-08-02T15:50:42Z
"Galaxy Luminosity Functions to z~1: DEEP2 vs. COMBO-17 and Implications
  for Red Galaxy Formation","The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are used to study the evolution of the
luminosity function of red and blue galaxies to $z \sim 1$. Schechter function
fits show that, since $z = 1$, $M^*_B$ dims by $\sim$ 1.3 mag per unit redshift
for both color classes, $\phi^*$ of blue galaxies shows little change, while
$\phi^*$ for red galaxies has formally nearly quadrupled. At face value, the
number density of blue galaxies has remained roughly constant since $ z = 1$,
whereas that of red galaxies has been rising. Luminosity densities support both
conclusions, but we note that most red-galaxy evolution occurs between our data
and local surveys and in our highest redshift bin, where the data are weakest.
We discuss the implications of having most red galaxies emerge after $z = 1$
from precursors among the blue population, taking into account the properties
of local and distant E/S0s. We suggest a ``mixed'' scenario in which some blue
galaxies have their star-formation quenched in gas-rich mergers, migrate to the
red sequence with a variety of masses, and merge further on the red sequence in
one or more purely stellar mergers. E/S0s of a given mass today will have
formed via different routes, in a manner that may help to explain the
fundamental plane and other local scaling laws.",2005-06-02T03:05:22Z
"Correspondence Between $5D$ Ricci-Flat Cosmological Models and
  Quintessence Dark Energy Models","We study the accelerating expansion and the induced dark energy of the $5D$
Ricci-flat universe which is characterized by having a big bounce as opposed to
a big bang. We show that the arbitrary function $\mu(t)$ contained in the $5D$
solutions can be rewritten in terms of the redshift $z$ as a new arbitrary
function $f(z)$, and we find that there is a correspondence between this $f(z)$
and the potential $V(\phi)$ of the 4D quintessence models. Using this
correspondence, the arbitrary function $f(z)$ and the $5D$ solution could be
specified for a given form of the potential $V(\phi)$.",2005-07-18T05:06:24Z
"The kinematics of the large western knot in the halo of the young
  planetary nebula NGC 6543","A detailed analysis is presented of the dominant ionised knot in the halo of
the planetary nebula NGC 6543. Observations were made at high spectral and
spatial resolution of the [OIII] 5007 line using the Manchester echelle
spectrometer combined with the 2.1-m San Pedro Martir Telescope. A 20-element
multislit was stepped across the field to give almost complete spatial coverage
of the knot and surrounding halo. The spectra reveal, for the first time, gas
flows around the kinematically inert knot. The gas flows are found to have
velocities comparable to the sound speed as gas is photo-evaporated off an
ionised surface. No evidence is found of fast wind interaction with the knot
and we find it likely that the fast wind is still contained in a
pressure-driven bubble in the core of the nebula. This rules out the
possibility of the knot having its origin in instabilities at the interface of
the fast and AGB winds. We suggest that the knot is embedded in the slowly
expanding Red Giant wind and that its surfaces are being continually
photoionised by the central star.",2005-07-08T12:18:07Z
The powerful outburst in Hercules A,"The radio source Hercules A resides at the center of a cooling flow cluster
of galaxies at redshift z = 0.154. A Chandra X-ray image reveals a shock front
in the intracluster medium (ICM) surrounding the radio source, about 160 kpc
from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) that hosts it. The shock has a Mach
number of 1.65, making it the strongest of the cluster-scale shocks driven by
an AGN outburst found so far. The age of the outburst ~5.9e7 y, its energy
about 3e61 erg and its mean power ~1.6e46 erg/s. As for the other large AGN
outbursts in cooling flow clusters, this outburst overwhelms radiative losses
from the ICM of the Hercules A cluster by a factor of ~100. It adds to the case
that AGN outbursts are a significant source of preheating for the ICM. Unless
the mechanical efficiency of the AGN in Hercules A exceeds 10%, the central
black hole must have grown by more than 1.7e8 Msun to power this one outburst.",2005-04-15T14:54:32Z
"An Extreme Case of a Misaligned Highly Flattened Wind in the Wolf-Rayet
  Binary CX Cephei","CX Cep (WR 151) is the WR+O binary (WN5+O5V) with the second shortest period
known in our Galaxy. To examine the circumstellar matter distribution and to
better constraint the orbital parameters and mass-loss rate of the WR star, we
obtained broadband and multi-band (i.e. UBVRI) linear polarization observations
of the system. Our analysis of the phase-locked polarimetric modulation
confirms the high orbital inclination of the system (i.e. $i=65^o$). Using the
orbital solution of Lewis et al. (1993) we obtain masses of $33.9 M_{\odot}$
and $23.9 M_{\odot}$ for the O and WR stars respectively, which agree with
their spectral types. A simple polarimetric model accounting for finite stellar
size effects allowed us to derive a mass-loss rate for the WR star of
$0.3-0.5\times10^{-5} M_{\odot}/yr$. This result was remarkably independent of
the model's input parameters and favors an earlier spectral type for the WR
component (i.e. WN4). Finally, using our multi-band observations, we fitted and
subtracted from our data the interstellar polarization. The resulting constant
intrinsic polarization of $3-4%$ is misaligned in relation to the orbital plane
(i.e. $\theta_{CIP}=26^o$ vs. $\Omega=75^o$) and is the highest intrinsic
polarization ever observed for a WR star. This misalignment points towards a
rotational (or magnetic) origin for the asymmetry and contradicts the most
recent evolutionary models for massive stars (Meynet & Maeder 2003) which
predict spherically symmetric winds during the WR phase (i.e. $CIP=0%$).",2005-07-26T19:12:56Z
Searching for Transiting Planets in Stellar Systems,"We analyze the properties of searches devoted to finding planetary transits
by observing simple stellar systems, such as globular clusters, open clusters,
and the Galactic bulge. We develop the analytic tools necessary to predict the
number of planets that a survey will detect as a function of the parameters of
the system, the observational setup, site properties, and planet properties. We
find that the detection probability is generally maximized for I-band
observations. The signal-to-noise ratio of a planetary transit is weakly
dependent on the mass of the primary for sources with flux above the sky
background, and falls very sharply for sources below sky. Therefore the number
of detectable planets is roughly proportional to the number of stars with
fluxes above sky (and not necessarily the number of sources with photometric
error less a given threshold). In order to maximize the number of detections,
experiments should be tailored such that stars near sky are above the detection
threshold. Once this requirement is met, the number of detected planets is
relatively weakly dependent on the detection threshold, diameter of the
telescope, exposure time, seeing, age of the system, and planet radius. The
number of detected planets is a strongly decreasing function of the distance to
the system, implying that the nearest, richest clusters may prove to be optimal
targets.",2005-04-06T20:01:46Z
"An Infalling Torus of Molecular Gas Around the Ultra-Compact HII Region
  G28.20-0.05","We present new observations of the ultra-compact HII region G28.20-0.05 in 23
GHz continuum, and the NH3(1,1), NH3(2.2), and NH3(3,3) lines. To explain the
complicated kinematics of the molecular gas, we propose a model consisting of
two components. One component is an infalling, equatorial torus of molecular
gas, whose dense central region has been ionized to form the ultra-compact HII
region. The second component is a larger expanding molecular shell driven by
some type of wide-angle outflow or wind. We estimate that the infall component
includes more than 18 Msun of molecular gas. We calculate the central mass to
be 79 Msun, probably comprising more than one star. The arrangement of the
molecular material suggests a connection to the other disk-like structures seen
around massive young stars. The central star in this case is more massive, and
the whole region may be more evolved than other similar objects such as IRAS
20126+4104, IRAS 18089-1732, G192.16-3.84, and AFGL5142.",2005-06-02T14:32:25Z
"Photoevaporation Flows in Blister HII Regions: I. Smooth Ionization
  Fronts and Application to the Orion Nebula","We present hydrodynamical simulations of the photoevaporation of a cloud with
large-scale density gradients, giving rise to an ionized, photoevaporation
flow. The flow is found to be approximately steady during the large part of its
evolution, during which it can resemble a ""champagne flow"" or a ""globule flow""
depending on the curvature of the ionization front. The distance from source to
ionization front and the front curvature uniquely determine the structure of
the flow, with the curvature depending on the steepness of the lateral density
gradient in the neutral cloud. We compare these simulations with both new and
existing observations of the Orion nebula and find that a model with a mildly
convex ionization front can reproduce the profiles of emission measure,
electron density, and mean line velocity for a variety of emitting ions on
scales of 10^{17} to 10^{18} cm. The principal failure of our model is that we
cannot explain the large observed widths of the [O I] 6300 Angstrom line that
forms at the ionization front.",2005-04-09T04:03:30Z
Cold Dust in (Some) High z Supernova Host Galaxies,"We present deep submillimetre photometry for 14 galaxies at z=0.5 that are
hosts of type 1a supernovae, with the aim of examining the evolution of dust
mass and extinction in normal galaxies. We combine these results with our
previous observations of 17 z~0.5 SN1a hosts to look for any evolution in the
dust content of normal galaxies between z=0 and z=0.5. The average observed
frame 850micron flux of SN1a hosts in the full sample, excluding 2 bright
individually detected objects, is 0.44 +/- 0.22 mJy. This flux level is
consistent with there being little or no evolution in the dust content, or
optical extinction, of normal galaxies from z=0 to z=0.5. One galaxy, the host
of SN1996cf, is detected individually, and we also present a deep HST STIS
image for this object. It appears to be an edge on disk system, similar to the
submm bright host of SN1997ey. We thus examine the dust properties of these and
one other individually detected object. 450-to-850 micron flux ratios and
limits suggest that the dust in the two brightest submm sources, SN1996cf and
SN1997ey, is cold, T ~20K, implying that they contain a substantial mass of
dust ~10^9 Msun. The presence of two bright (F850 >7mJy) submm sources at z~0.5
in a sample of ostensibly normal galaxies is surprising, and has important
implications. It supports the idea that a substantial part of the Cosmic
Infrared Background (CIB) may be produced at z<1, while also suggesting that
'foreground' objects such as these may be a significant 'contaminant' in submm
surveys. Finally, we examine the overall submm luminosity distribution at z=0.5
implied by our results, and conclude that either there is substantial evolution
in the submm luminosity function from z=0 to 0.5, or our submm detected sources
are somehow not representative of the bulk of galaxies at this redshift.",2005-07-27T16:30:09Z

Acceleration of the universe with a simple trigonometric potential,"In this paper we investigate the quintessence model with a minimally coupled
scalar field in the context of recent supernovae observations. By choosing a
particular form of the deceleration parameter q, which gives an early
deceleration and late time acceleration for dust dominated model, we show that
this sign flip in q can be obtained by a simple trigonometric patential. The
early matter dominated model expands with q=1/2 as desired and enters a
negative q phase quite late during the evolution.",2005-05-06T10:50:29Z
Inflationary predictions for scalar and tensor fluctuations reconsidered,"We reconsider the predictions of inflation for the spectral index of scalar
(energy density) fluctuations (n_s) and the tensor/scalar ratio (r) using a
discrete, model-independent measure of the degree of fine-tuning required to
obtain a given combination of (n_s, r). We find that, except for cases with
numerous unnecessary degrees of fine-tuning, n_s is less than 0.98, measurably
different from exact Harrison-Zel'dovich. Furthermore, if n_s \gtrsim 0.95, in
accord with current measurements, the tensor/scalar ratio satisfies r \gtrsim
10^{-2}, a range that should be detectable in proposed cosmic microwave
background polarization experiments and direct gravitational wave searches.",2005-07-19T20:10:39Z
The Formation of Fossil Galaxy Groups in the hierarchical Universe,"We use a set of twelve high-resolution N-body/hydrodynamical simulations in
the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology to investigate the origin and formation rate of
fossil groups (FGs), which are X-ray bright galaxy groups dominated by a large
elliptical galaxy, with the second brightest galaxy being at least two
magnitudes fainter. The simulations invoke star formation, chemical evolution
with non-instantaneous recycling, metal dependent radiative cooling, strong
star burst driven galactic super winds, effects of a meta-galactic UV field and
full stellar population synthesis. We find an interesting correlation between
the magnitude gap between the first and second brightest galaxy and the
formation time of the group. It is found that FGs have assembled half of their
final dark matter mass already at $z\ga1$, and subsequently typically grow by
minor merging only, wheras non-FGs on average form later. The early assembly of
FGs leaves sufficient time for galaxies of $L \sim L_*$ to merge into the
central one by dynamical friction, resulting in the large magnitude gap at
$z=0$. A fraction of 33$\pm$16% of the groups simulated are found to be fossil,
whereas the observational estimate is $\sim$10-20%. The FGs are found to be
X-ray over-luminous relative to non-FGs of the same optical luminosity, in
qualitative agreement with observations. Finally, from a dynamical friction
analysis is found that only because infall of $L \sim L_*$ galaxies happens
along filaments with small impact parameters do FGs exist at all.",2005-05-26T20:02:28Z
"Site testing in summer at Dome C, Antarctica","We present summer site testing results based on DIMM data obtained at Dome C,

two 3-months summer campaigns in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. We performed
continuous monitoring of the seeing a nd the isoplanatic angle in the visible.
We found a median seeing of 0.54 \arcsec and a median isoplanatic angle of 6.8

"Mid-infrared spectroscopy of two luminous submillimeter galaxies at
  z~2.8","Using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope,
we have obtained rest frame mid-infrared spectroscopy of two bright
submillimeter galaxies. SMMJ02399-0136 at z=2.81 shows a superposition of PAH
emission features and a mid-infrared continuum, indicating significant and
roughly equal contributions to its bolometric luminosity from star formation
and from a Compton-thick AGN. We derive a new redshift of z=2.80 for
MMJ154127+6616 from the IRS spectrum and find this object is dominated by
starburst PAH emission. The rest frame mid- to far-infrared spectral energy
distributions are consistent with these submillimeter galaxies being scaled up
versions of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The mid-infrared spectra
support the scenario that submillimeter galaxies are sites of extreme star
formation and represent a key phase in the formation of massive galaxies.",2005-04-20T07:47:01Z
Massive galaxy clusters and the origin of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays,"We investigate whether ultra--high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) may be
preferentially produced in massive galaxy clusters, by looking for correlations
between UHECR directions and those of x-ray clusters. We find an
excess-above-random of high energy cosmic rays which correlate with massive
galaxy cluster positions. For cosmic rays with energies above 50 EeV the
observed correlation is the strongest or angles of 1.2-1.6 degrees where it has
a chance probability of about 0.1%.
  Including lower energy cosmic rays in the sample causes the angle where the
most significant correlation is found to increase, as would be expected by
virtue of instrumental and magnetic smearing increasing at lower energy.
  These results suggest that some UHECR are produced in galaxy clusters, or in
objects that preferentially populate galaxy clusters.",2005-07-29T19:53:38Z
e-VLBI observations of SN2001em - an off-axis GRB candidate,"Studying transient phenomena with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) technique faces severe difficulties because the turnaround time of the
experiments from the observations to the scientific result is rather long. The
e-VLBI technique has made it possible to transfer the data from a number of
European VLBI Network (EVN) telescopes to the central data processor at JIVE
through optical fibres, and correlate them in real time. The main goal of this
paper is to introduce this rapidly developing new technique, by presenting
observational results from a recent experiment. We observed SN2001em, a Type
Ib/c supernova with an e-VLBI array and the Multi-Element Radio Linked
Interferometer Network (MERLIN) in the UK. The source is marginally detected in
our observations. We cannot make definite conclusions whether it is resolved at
1.6 GHz or not. Our data show that SN2001em either started fading in the last
couple of months, or its radio spectrum is inverted at low
frequencies,indicating free-free or synchrotron self-absorption. This is quite
unusual, but not unprecedented in radio SNe.",2005-05-23T08:52:09Z
Mapping dark matter with cosmic magnification,"We develop a new tool to generate statistically precise dark matter maps from
the cosmic magnification of galaxies with distance estimates. We show how to
overcome the intrinsic clustering problem using the slope of the luminosity
function, because magnificability changes strongly over the luminosity
function, while intrinsic clustering only changes weakly. This may allow
precision cosmology beyond most current systematic limitations. SKA is able to
reconstruct projected matter density map at smoothing scale $\sim 10^{'}$ with
S/N$\geq 1$, at the rate of 200-4000 deg$^2$ per year, depending on the
abundance and evolution of 21cm emitting galaxies. This power of mapping dark
matter is comparable to, or even better than that of cosmic shear from deep
optical surveys or 21cm surveys.",2005-06-29T20:31:38Z
X-ray observations of Clusters of Galaxies,"X-ray observations of clusters provide key information on the dark matter, on
the formation of structures in the Universe, and can be used to constrain the
cosmological parameters. I review our current knowledge, with emphasis on
recent XMM and Chandra results.",2005-08-05T14:53:10Z
"Self-similar structure of the magnetized radiation-dominated accretion
  disks","We investigate the effects of a large-scale magnetic field with open field
lines on the steady-state structure of a radiation-dominated accretion disk,
using self-similarity technique. The disk is supposed to be turbulent and
possesses an effective viscosity and an effective magnetic diffusivity. We
consider the extreme case in which the generated energy due to viscous and
magnetic dissipation is balanced by the advection cooling. While the magnetic
field outside of the disk is treated in a phenomenological way, the internal
field is determined self-consistently. Magnetized and nonmagnetized solutions
have the same radial dependence, irrespective of the values of the input
parameters. Generally, our self-similar solutions are very sensitive to the
viscosity or diffusivity coefficients. For example, the density and the
rotation velocity increase when the viscosity coefficient decreases. The gas
rotates with sub-Keplerian angular velocity with a factor less than unity which
depends on the magnetic field configuration. Magnetic field significantly
reduce disk thickness, however, tends to increase the radial velocity comparing
to the nonmagnetic self-similar solutions.",2005-05-28T06:18:48Z
Semi-empiric Radiative Transfer Modeling of FUSE Stellar Spectra,"We present an overview of radiative transfer modeling efforts to interpret
spectra of a variety of stellar objects observed with FUSE. Detailed radiative
transfer modeling of high ion emission line profiles of C III and O VI observed
in the far-UV spectrum provides a powerful means to probe the thermal and
dynamic properties of high-temperature plasmas in the atmospheres of stars. We
model asymmetric emission lines of C III lam977 observed in spectra of luminous
cool stars such as Alpha Aqr, to infer the wind- and microturbulence velocity
structures of the upper chromosphere. Semi-empiric radiative transfer models
that include transition region temperature conditions, are further developed
based on detailed fits to O VI resonance emission lines in the supergiant Alpha
Aqr, the classical Cepheid variable Beta Dor, and to self-absorbed O VI
emission lines in the cataclysmic variable SW UMa.
  We observe that the C III resonance line profile of Alpha Aqr assumes a
remarkable asymmetric shape, reminiscent of P Cygni type profiles observed in
hot luminous supergiants. The model calculations indicate outflow velocities
above ~140 km/s at kinetic temperatures of 65 kK and higher. Based on detailed
model fits to the narrow red-shifted and self-absorbed O VI emission lines of
SW UMa we compute that the gas- and electron-density exceed the density
conditions of the upper solar transition region by about three orders of
magnitude. We discuss how detailed semi-empiric fits to emission lines observed
with the high spectral resolution of FUSE can provide reliable constraints on
the mass-loss or mass-accretion rates in these objects.",2005-04-24T03:43:41Z
"Solar Control on Jupiter's Equatorial X-ray Emissions: 26-29 November
  2003 XMM-Newton Observation","During November 26-29, 2003 XMM-Newton observed soft (0.2-2 keV) X-ray
emission from Jupiter for 69 hours. The low-latitude X-ray disk emission of
Jupiter is observed to be almost uniform in intensity with brightness that is
consistent with a solar-photon driven process. The simultaneous lightcurves of
Jovian equatorial X-rays and solar X-rays (measured by the TIMED/SEE and GOES
satellites) show similar day-to-day variability. A large solar X-ray flare
occurring on the Jupiter-facing side of the Sun is found to have a
corresponding feature in the Jovian X-rays. These results support the
hypothesis that X-ray emission from Jovian low-latitudes are solar X-rays
scattered from the planet's upper atmosphere, and suggest that the Sun directly
controls the non-auroral X-rays from Jupiter's disk. Our study also suggests
that Jovian equatorial X-rays can be used to monitor the solar X-ray flare
activity on the hemisphere of the Sun that is invisible to space weather
satellites.",2005-04-29T17:51:49Z
The Birth of Massive Stars and Star Clusters,"In the present-day universe, it appears that most, and perhaps all, massive
stars are born in star clusters. It also appears that all star clusters contain
stars drawn from an approximately universal initial mass function, so that
almost all rich young star clusters contain massive stars. In this review I
discuss the physical processes associated with both massive star formation and
with star cluster formation. First I summarize the observed properties of
star-forming gas clumps, then address the following questions. How do these
clumps emerge from giant molecular clouds? In these clustered environments, how
do individual stars form and gain mass? Can a forming star cluster be treated
as an equilibrium system or is this process too rapid for equilibrium to be
established? How does feedback affect the formation process?",2005-04-11T21:36:10Z
Radiative Habitable Zones in Martian Polar Environments,"The biologically damaging solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (quantified by the
DNA-weighted dose) reaches the Martian surface in extremely high levels.
Searching for potentially habitable UV-protected environments on Mars, we
considered the polar ice caps that consist of a seasonally varying CO2 ice
cover and a permanent H2O ice layer. It was found that, though the CO2 ice is
insufficient by itself to screen the UV radiation, at 1 m depth within the
perennial H2O ice the DNA-weighted dose is reduced to terrestrial levels. This
depth depends strongly on the optical properties ofthe H2O ice layers (for
instance snow-lile layes). The Earth-like DNA-weighted dose and
Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) requirements were used to define the
upper and lower limits of the nortern and southern polar radiative habitable
zone (RHZ) for which a temporal and spatial mapping was performed. Based on
these studies we conclude that phtosynthetic life might be possible within the
ice layers of the polar regions. The thickness varies along each Martian polar
spring and summer between 1.5 m and 2.4 m for H2= ice-like layers, and a few
centimeters for snow-like covers. These Martian Earth-like radiative habitable
environments may be primary targets for future Martian astrobiological
missions. Special attention should be paid to planetary protection, since the
polar RHZ may also be subject to terrestrial contamination by probes.",2005-07-13T10:40:53Z
The need for small-scale turbulence in atmospheres of substellar objects,"Brown dwarfs and giant gas planets are substellar objects whose spectral
appearance is determined by the chemical composition of the gas and the
solids/liquids in the atmosphere. Atmospheres of substellar objects possess two
major scale regimes: large-scale convective motions + gravitational settling
and small-scale turbulence + dust formation. Turbulence initiates dust
formation spot-like on small scale, while the dust feeds back into the
turbulent fluid field by its strong radiative cooling. Small, imploding dust
containing areas result which eventually become isothermal. Multi-dimensional
simulations show that these small-scale dust structures gather into large-scale
structures, suggesting the formation of clouds made of dirty dust grains. The
chemical composition of the grains, and thereby the chemical evolution of the
gas phase, is a function of temperature and depends on the grain's history.",2005-06-09T13:54:28Z
Einstein-de Sitter model re-examined for the newly discovered SNe Ia,"Consistency of Einstein-de Sitter model with the recently observed SNe Ia by
the Hubble Space Telescope is examined. The model shows a reasonable fit to the
observation, if one takes into account the extinction of SNe light by the
intergalactic metallic dust ejected from the SNe explosions. Though the fit to
the new data is worsened considerably compared with the earlier data, it can
still be regarded acceptable. We should wait for more accurate observations at
higher redshifts (as expected from the coming space missions such as SNAP and
JWST) in order to rule out a model, which seems to explain all the other
existing observations well (some even better than the favoured $\Lambda$CDM
model), is consistent with beautiful theoretical ideas like inflation and cold
dark matter, and is not as speculative as the models of dark energy.",2005-06-09T20:00:56Z
The Luminosity Dependence of Quasar Clustering,"We investigate the luminosity dependence of quasar clustering, inspired by
numerical simulations of galaxy mergers that incorporate black hole growth.
These simulations have motivated a new interpretation of the quasar luminosity
function. In this picture, the bright end of the quasar luminosity function
consists of quasars radiating nearly at their peak luminosities, while the
faint end consists mainly of very similar sources, but at dimmer phases in
their evolution. We combine this model with the statistics of dark matter halos
that host quasar activity. We find that, since bright and faint quasars are
mostly similar sources seen in different evolutionary stages, a broad range in
quasar luminosities corresponds to only a narrow range in the masses of quasar
host halos. On average, bright and faint quasars reside in similar host halos.
Consequently, we argue that quasar clustering should depend only weakly on
luminosity. This prediction is in qualitative agreement with recent
measurements of the luminosity dependence of the quasar correlation function
(Croom et al. 2005) and the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation function
(Adelberger & Steidel 2005). Future precision clustering measurements from SDSS
and 2dF, spanning a large range in luminosity, should provide a strong test of
our model.",2005-07-15T00:22:36Z
"Hard X-ray and Gamma-ray Emission Induced by Ultra-High Energy Protons
  in Cluster Accretion Shocks and their Detectability","Protons can be plausibly accelerated to $\sim 10^{18}$-$10^{19}$ eV in strong
accretion shocks surrounding massive clusters of galaxies. Such protons
efficiently produce very high energy pairs through interactions with the CMB,
which then radiate synchrotron and inverse Compton emission with hard spectra,
peaking respectively in hard X-rays and TeV gamma-rays. We discuss the
prospects for detecting this emission from nearby clusters with current and
future facilities such as HESS and NeXT, which should provide a clear signature
of ultra-high energy proton acceleration and an important probe of magnetic
fields in the outermost regions of clusters.",2005-07-04T14:24:52Z
"An Excess Due to Small Grains Around The Nearby K0V Star HD69830:
  Asteroid or Cometary Debris?","Spitzer photometry and spectroscopy of the star HD69830 reveal an excess of
emission relative to the stellar photosphere between 8 and 35 $\mu$m dominated
by strong features attributable to crystalline silicates with an emitting
surface area more than 1,000 times that of our zodiacal cloud. The spectrum
closely resembles that of the comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp). Since no excess is
detected at 70 $\mu$m, the emitting material must be quite warm, be confined
within a few AU of the star, and originate in grains with low long-wavelength
emissivity, i.e. grains much smaller than $70 \mu$m$/2\pi\sim 10 $ $\mu$m. The
strong mineralogical features are evidence for even smaller, possibly
sub-micron sized grains. This small grain size is in direct contrast to the
10-100 $\mu$m grains that dominate the relatively featureless spectra of our
zodiacal dust cloud and most other main sequence stars with excesses. The upper
limit at 70 $\mu$m also implies that any Kuiper Belt analog must either be very
cold or be less massive than $\sim$ 5 times our own Kuiper Belt.
  With collisional and Poynting-Robertson drag times of about a thousand years
for small grains, the emitting material must either: a) be created through
continual grinding down of material in a dense asteroid belt; or b) originate
in cometary debris arising from either a single ``super-comet'' or a very large
number of individual comets arriving from a distant reservoir. In the case of a
cometary origin for the emission, the mass requirements for continuous
generation by many individual comets are unreasonable and we favor the capture
of a single ``super comet'' into a 0.5-1 AU orbit where it can evolve a large
number of small grains over a 2 Myr period.",2005-04-22T00:59:43Z
Exploring Large-scale Structure with Billions of Galaxies,"We consider cosmological applications of galaxy number density correlations
to be inferred from future deep and wide multi-band optical surveys. We mostly
focus on very large scales as a probe of possible features in the primordial
power spectrum. We find the proposed survey of the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope may be competitive with future all-sky CMB experiments over a broad
range of scales. On very large scales the inferred power spectrum is robust to
photometric redshift errors, and, given a sufficient number density of
galaxies, to angular variations in dust extinction and photometric calibration
errors. We also consider other applications, such as constraining dark energy
with the two CMB-calibrated standard rulers in the matter power spectrum, and
controlling the effect of photometric redshift errors to facilitate the
interpretation of cosmic shear data. We find that deep photometric surveys over
wide area can provide constraints that are competitive with spectroscopic
surveys in small volumes.",2005-08-03T23:15:37Z
SXP 323 - an unusual X-ray binary system in the Small Magellanic Cloud,"Spectroscopic observations taken with the VLT/UVES telescope/instrument are
presented of the unusual Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) X-ray binary system SXP
323 = AX J0051-733. This system shows a clear modulation at 0.71d in long term
optical photometry which has been proposed as the binary period of this system.
The high resolution optical spectra, taken at a range of phases during the
0.71d cycle, rule out this possibility. Instead it is suggested that this
long-term effect is due to Non Radial Pulsations (NRP) in the Be star companion
to SXP 323. In addition, the spectra show clear evidence for major changes in
the (V/R) ratio of the double peaks of the Balmer lines indicative of
asymmetries in the circumstellar disk. The complex structure of the
interstellar lines are also discussed in the context of the SMC structure.",2005-06-28T11:17:40Z
"Numerical Galaxy Catalog -I. A Semi-analytic Model of Galaxy Formation
  with N-body simulations","We construct the Numerical Galaxy Catalog ($\nu$GC), based on a semi-analytic
model of galaxy formation combined with high-resolution N-body simulations in a
$\Lambda$-dominated flat cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model.
The model includes several essential ingredients for galaxy formation, such as
merging histories of dark halos directly taken from N-body simulations,
radiative gas cooling, star formation, heating by supernova explosions
(supernova feedback), mergers of galaxies, population synthesis, and extinction
by internal dust and intervening HI clouds. As the first paper in a series
using this model, we focus on basic photometric, structural and kinematical
properties of galaxies at present and high redshifts. Two sets of model
parameters are examined, strong and weak supernova feedback models, which are
in good agreement with observational luminosity functions of local galaxies in
a range of observational uncertainty. Both models agree well with many
observations such as cold gas mass-to-stellar luminosity ratios of spiral
galaxies, HI mass functions, galaxy sizes, faint galaxy number counts and
photometric redshift distributions in optical pass-bands, isophotal angular
sizes, and cosmic star formation rates. In particular, the strong supernova
feedback model is in much better agreement with near-infrared (K'-band) faint
galaxy number counts and redshift distribution than the weak feedback model and
our previous semi-analytic models based on the extended Press-Schechter
formalism. (Abridged)",2005-08-02T20:30:58Z
"A Mid-Infrared Imaging Survey of Embedded Young Stellar Objects in the
  Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Core","Results of a comprehensive, new, ground-based mid-infrared imaging survey of
the young stellar population of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud are presented. Data were
acquired at the Palomar 5-m and at the Keck 10-m telescopes with the MIRLIN and
LWS instruments, at 0.25 arcsec and 0.25 arcsec resolutions, respectively. Of
172 survey objects, 85 were detected. Among the 22 multiple systems observed,
15 were resolved and their individual component fluxes determined. A plot of
the frequency distribution of the detected objects with SED spectral slope
shows that YSOs spend ~400,000 yr in the Flat Spectrum phase, clearing out
their remnant infall envelopes. Mid-infrared variability is found among a
significant fraction of the surveyed objects, and is found to occur for all SED
classes with optically thick disks. Large-amplitude near-infrared variability,
also found for all SED classes with optically thick disks, seems to occur with
somewhat higher frequency at the earlier evolutionary stages. Although a
general trend of mid-infrared excess and NIR veiling exists proceeding through
SED classes, with Class I objects generally exhibiting K-veilings > 1, Flat
Spectrum objects with K-veilings > 0.58, and Class III objects with K-veilings
=0, Class II objects exhibit the widest range of K-band veiling values, 0-4.5.
However, the highly variable value of veiling that a single source can exhibit
in any of the SED classes in which active disk accretion can take place is
striking, and is direct observational evidence for highly time-variable
accretion activity in disks. Finally, by comparing mid-infrared vs.
near-infrared excesses in a subsample with well-determined effective
temperatures and extinction values, disk clearing mechanisms are explored. The
results are consistent with disk clearing proceeding from the inside-out.",2005-04-19T22:04:33Z
"The relativistic shift of narrow spectral features from black-hole
  accretion discs","Transient spectral features have been discovered in the X-ray spectra of
Active Galactic Nuclei, mostly in the 5--7 keV energy range. Several
interpretations were proposed for the origin of these features. We examined a
model of Doppler boosted blue horns of the iron line originating from a spot in
a black hole accretion disc, taking into account different approximations of
general relativistic light rays and the resulting shift of energy of photons.
We provide a practical formula for the blue horn energy of an intrinsically
narrow line and assess its accuracy by comparing the approximation against an
exact value, predicted under the assumption of a planar accretion disc. The
most accurate approximation provides excellent agreement with the spot orbital
radius down to the marginally stable orbit of a non-rotating black hole.",2005-07-08T17:55:50Z
Calibration of VERITAS Telescope 1 via Muons,"Cherenkov light from cosmic-ray muons is a significant source of background
for the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique. However, muon events are also
valuable as a diagnostic tool because they produce distinctive ring images, and
the expected amount of Cherenkov light per unit arclength can be accurately
calculated. We report on a comparison of real and simulated muon events in
VERITAS Telescope 1, using this comparison to validate the detector model and
to determine the light collection efficiency of the telescope.",2005-07-19T18:34:44Z
The Structure of Close Binaries in Two Dimensions,"The structure and evolution of close binary stars has been studied using the
two-dimensional (2D) stellar structure algorithm developed by Deupree (1995).
We have calculated a series of solar composition stellar evolution sequences of
binary models, where the mass of the 2D model is 8Msun with a point-mass 5Msun
companion. We have also studied the structure of the companion in 2D, by
considering the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) structure of a 5Msun model with
an 8Msun point-mass companion. In all cases the binary orbit was assumed to be
circular and co-rotating with the rotation rate of the stars. We considered
binary models with three different initial separations, a = 10, 14 and 20Rsun.
These models were evolved through central hydrogen burning or until the more
massive star expanded to fill its critical potential surface or Roche lobe. The
calculations show that evolution of the deep interior quantities is only
slightly modified from those of single star evolution. Describing the model
surface as a Roche equipotential is also satisfactory until very close to the
time of Roche lobe overflow, when the self gravity of the model about to lose
mass develops a noticeable aspherical component and the surface time scale
becomes sufficiently short that it is conceivable that the actual surface is
not an equipotential.",2005-07-11T18:54:40Z
A substellar companion around the intermediate-mass giant star HD 11977,"We report the discovery of a substellar companion to the intermediate-mass
star HD 11977 (G5 III). Radial velocities of this star have been monitored for
five years with FEROS at the 1.52-m ESO and later at the 2.2-m MPG/ESO
telescope in La Silla, Chile. Based on the collected data we calculated an
orbital solution with a period of P=711 days, a semi-amplitude of K1=105 m/s,
and an eccentricity of e=0.4. The period of the radial-velocity variation is
longer than that of the estimated stellar rotation, rendering it unlikely that
rotational modulation is the source of the variation in the radial velocity.
This hypothesis is supported by the absence of a correlation between stellar
activity indicators and radial-velocity variation. By determining a primary
stellar mass of Mstar=1.91 Msun, the best-fit minimum mass of the companion and
semi-major axis of the orbit are m2sini=6.54 Mjup and a2=1.93 AU, respectively.
An upper limit for the mass of the companion of m2 < 65.5 Mjup has been
calculated from Hipparcos astrometric measurements. Although the possibility of
a brown-dwarf companion cannot be excluded, HD 11977 B is one of the few planet
candidates detected around an intermediate-mass star. The progenitor
main-sequence star of HD 11977 is probably an A-type star. This discovery gives
an indirect evidence for planetary companions around early type main-sequence
stars.",2005-05-25T12:17:37Z
Latitudinal Shear Instabilities during Type I X-ray Bursts,"Coherent oscillations have been observed during Type I X-ray bursts from 14
accreting neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries, providing important
information about their spin frequencies. However, the origin of the brightness
asymmetry on the neutron star surface producing these oscillations is still not
understood. We study the stability of a zonal shearing flow on the neutron star
surface using a shallow water model. We show that differential rotation of >2%
between pole and equator, with the equator spinning faster than the poles, is
unstable to hydrodynamic shear instabilities. The unstable eigenmodes have
properties well-matched to burst oscillations: low azimuthal wavenumber m, wave
speeds 1 or 2% below the equatorial spin rate, and e-folding times close to a
second. Instability is related to low frequency buoyantly driven r-modes that
have a mode frequency within the range of rotation frequencies in the
differentially rotating shell. We discuss the implications for burst
oscillations. Growth of shear instabilities may explain the brightness
asymmetry in the tail of X-ray bursts, although some fine tuning of the level
of differential rotation and a spin frequency near 300 Hz are required in order
for the fastest growing mode to have m=1. If shear instabilities are to operate
during a burst, temperature contrasts of 30% across the star must be created
during ignition and spreading of the flash.",2005-05-04T03:49:12Z
"A Measurement of the Angular Power Spectrum of the CMB Temperature
  Anisotropy from the 2003 Flight of Boomerang","We report on observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) obtained
during the January 2003 flight of Boomerang . These results are derived from
195 hours of observation with four 145 GHz Polarization Sensitive Bolometer
(PSB) pairs, identical in design to the four 143 GHz Planck HFI polarized
pixels. The data include 75 hours of observations distributed over 1.84% of the
sky with an additional 120 hours concentrated on the central portion of the
field, itself representing 0.22% of the full sky. From these data we derive an
estimate of the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations of the CMB
in 24 bands over the multipole range (50 < l < 1500). A series of features,
consistent with those expected from acoustic oscillations in the primordial
photon-baryon fluid, are clearly evident in the power spectrum, as is the
exponential damping of power on scales smaller than the photon mean free path
at the epoch of last scattering (l > 900). As a consistency check, the
collaboration has performed two fully independent analyses of the time ordered
data, which are found to be in excellent agreement.",2005-07-21T15:06:12Z
Mass Loss Due to Sputtering and Thermal Processes in Meteoroid Ablation,"Conventional meteoroid theory assumes that the dominant mode of ablation is
by evaporation following intense heating during atmospheric flight. In this
paper we consider the question of whether sputtering may provide an alternative
disintegration process of some importance.For meteoroids in the mass range from
10^-3 to 10^-13 kg and covering a meteor velocity range from 11 to 71 km/s, we
numerically modeled both thermal ablation and sputtering ablation during
atmospheric flight. We considered three meteoroid models believed to be
representative of asteroidal (3300 kg m^-3 mass density), cometary (1000 kg
m^-3) and porous cometary (300 kg m^-3) meteoroid structures. Atmospheric
profiles which considered the molecular compositions at different heights were
used in the sputtering calculations. We find that while in many cases
(particularly at low velocities and for relatively large meteoroid masses)
sputtering contributes only a small amount of mass loss during atmospheric
flight, in some cases sputtering is very important. For example, a 10^-10 kg
porous meteoroid at 40 km/s will lose nearly 51% of its mass by sputtering,
while a 10^-13 kg asteroidal meteoroid at 60 km/s will lose nearly 83% of its
mass by sputtering. We argue that sputtering may explain the light production
observed at very great heights in some Leonid meteors. The impact of this work
will be most dramatic for very small meteoroids such as those observed with
large aperture radars.",2005-05-13T15:16:23Z
The Distribution of Satellite Galaxies in a Lambda-CDM Universe,"We compute the locations of satellite galaxies with respect to their hosts
using the Lambda-CDM GIF simulation. If the major axes of the hosts' images are
perfectly aligned with the major axes of their projected mass, the satellites
are located preferentially close to the hosts' major axes. In this case, the
degree of anisotropy in the satellite locations is a good tracer of the
flattening of the hosts' halos. If all hosts have luminous circular disks, the
symmetry axes of the projected mass and light are not perfectly aligned, and
the locations of the satellites depend upon how the hosts' disks are placed
within their halos. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the
major axes of the halos, the satellites show a pronounced ""Holmberg effect"". If
the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the intermediate axes of the
local large scale structure, the distribution of satellite locations is
essentially isotropic. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with
either the minor axes or with the net angular momentum vectors of the halos,
the satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts, with a
preference for being found nearby the hosts' major axes. This agrees well with
the observation that satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey tend to
be found nearby the major axes of their hosts, and suggests that the mass and
light of SDSS host galaxies must be fairly well aligned in projection on the
sky.",2005-05-12T22:35:05Z
"The Cornell High-order Adaptive Optics Survey for Brown Dwarfs in
  Stellar Systems-I: Observations, Data Reduction, and Detection Analysis","In this first of a two-paper sequence, we report techniques and results of
the Cornell High-order Adaptive Optics Survey for brown dwarf companions
(CHAOS). At the time of this writing, this study represents the most sensitive
published population survey of brown dwarf companions to main sequence stars,
for separation akin to our own outer solar system. The survey, conducted using
the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope, consists of K-short coronagraphic
observations of 80 main sequence stars out to 22 parsecs. At 1 arcsecond
separations from a typical target system, the survey achieves median
sensitivities 10 magnitudes fainter than the parent star. In terms of companion
mass, the survey achieves typical sensitivities of 25 Jupiter masses (1 Gyr),
50 Jupiter masses (solar age), and 60 Jupiter masses (10 Gyr), using
evolutionary models of Baraffe et al. (2003). Using common proper motion to
distinguish companions from field stars, we find that no systems show positive
evidence of a substellar companion (searchable separation 1-15 arcseconds
[projected separation ~ 10-155 AU at the median target distance]). In the
second paper of the series we shall present our Monte Carlo population
simulations.",2005-06-13T19:30:03Z
"CMB maps lensed by cosmological structures: Simulations and statistical
  analysis","A method for ray-tracing through n-body simulations has been recently
proposed. It is based on a periodic universe covered by simulation boxes.
Photons move along appropriate directions to avoid periodicity effects. Here,
an improved version of this method is applied to simulate lensed CMB maps and
maps of lens deformations. Particle mesh n-body simulations with appropriate
boxes and resolutions are used to evolve the nonlinear inhomogeneities until
present time. The resulting maps are statistically analyzed to look for
deviations from Gaussianity. These deviations are measured --for the first
time-- using correlations for configurations of n directions (n being smaller
than 7). A wide range of angular scales are considered. Some interesting
prospects are outlined.",2005-04-20T17:13:42Z
Core Overshoot: An Improved Treatment and Constraints from Seismic Data,"We present a comprehensive set of stellar evolution models for Procyon A in
an effort to guide future measurements of both traditional stellar parameters
and seismic frequencies towards constraining the amount of core overshoot in
Procyon A and possibly other stars. Current observational measurements of
Procyon A when combined with traditional stellar modeling only place a large
upper limit on overshoot of alphaOV < 1.1. By carrying out a detailed pulsation
analysis, we further demonstrate, how p- and g-mode averaged spacings can be
used to gain better estimates of the core size. For both p- and g-modes, the
frequency spacings for models without overshoot are clearly separated from the
models with overshoot. In addition, measurements of the l=0 averaged small
p-mode spacings could be used to establish Procyon A's evolutionary stage. For
a fixed implementation of overshoot and under favorable circumstances, the
g-mode spacings can be used to determine the overshoot extent to an accuracy of
+-0.05 Hp. However, we stress that considerable confusion is added due to the
unknown treatment of the overshoot region. This ambiguity might be removed by
analyzing many different stars. A simple non-local convection theory developed
by Kuhfuss is implemented in our stellar evolution code and contrasted with the
traditional approaches. We show that this theory supports a moderate increase
of the amount of convective overshoot with stellar mass of Delta(alphaOV) =
+0.10 between 1.5 Msun and 15 Msun. This theory places an upper limit on
Procyon A's core overshoot extent of ~0.4 Hp which matches the limit imposed by
Roxburgh's integral criterion.",2005-05-01T18:22:47Z
"Optimal column density measurements from multiband near-infrared
  observations","We consider from a general point of view the problem of determining the
extinction in dense molecular clouds. We use a rigorous statistical approach to
characterize the properties of the most widely used optical and infrared
techniques, namely the star count and the color excess methods. We propose a
new maximum-likelihood method that takes advantage of both star counts and star
colors to provide an optimal estimate of the extinction. Detailed numerical
simulations show that our method performs optimally under a wide range of
conditions and, in particular, is significantly superior to the standard
techniques for clouds with high column-densities and affected by contamination
by foreground stars.",2005-04-14T11:58:51Z
High-resolution observations of SN 2001gd in NGC 5033,"We report on 8.4 GHz VLBI observations of SN2001gd in the spiral galaxy
NGC5033 made on 26 June 2002 and 8 April 2003. Our data nominally suggests a
relatively strong deceleration for the expansion of SN2001gd, but we cannot
dismiss the possibility of a free supernova expansion. From our VLBI
observations on 8 April 2003, we inferred a minimum total energy in
relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the supernova shell of E_min
=(0.3-14) 10^{47} ergs, and a corresponding equipartition average magnetic
field of B_min = (50--350) mG. We also present multiwavelength VLA measurements
of SN2001gd, which are well fit by an optically thin, synchrotron spectrum,
partially absorbed by thermal plasma. We obtain a supernova flux density of
(1.02 +/- 0.05) mJy at the observing frequency of 8.4 GHz for the second epoch,
which results in an isotropic radio luminosity of (6.0 +/- 0.3) * 10^{36} ergs
between 1.4 and 43.3 GHz, at an adopted distance of 13.1 Mpc. Finally, we
report on an XMM-Newton X-ray detection of SN2001gd on 18 December 2002. The
supernova X-ray spectrum is consistent with optically thin emission from a soft
component (associated with emission from the reverse shock) at a temperature
around 1 keV. The observed flux corresponds to an isotropic X-ray luminosity of
L_X = 1.4 +/- 0.4 * 10^{39} ergs/s in the (0.3-5) keV band. We suggest that
both radio and X-ray observations of SN2001gd indicate that a circumstellar
interaction similar to that displayed by SN1993J in M81 is taking place.",2005-04-28T20:02:50Z
Anti-Truncation of Disks in Early-Type Barred Galaxies,"The disks of spiral galaxies are commonly thought to be truncated: the radial
surface brightness profile steepens sharply beyond a certain radius (3--5
inner-disk scale lengths). Here we present the radial brightness profiles of a
number of barred S0--Sb galaxies with the opposite behavior: their outer
profiles are distinctly shallower in slope than the main disk profile. We term
these ""anti-truncations""; they are found in at least 25% of a larger sample of
barred S0--Sb galaxies. There are two distinct types of anti-truncations. About
one-third show a fairly gradual transition and outer isophotes which are
progressively rounder than the main disk isophotes, suggestive of a disk
embedded within a more spheroidal outer zone -- either the outer extent of the
bulge or a separate stellar halo. But the majority of the profiles have rather
sharp surface-brightness transitions to the shallower, outer exponential
profile and, crucially, outer isophotes which are not significantly rounder
than the main disk; in the Sab--Sb galaxies, the outer isophotes include
visible spiral arms. This suggests that the outer light is still part of the
disk. A subset of these profiles are in galaxies with asymmetric outer
isophotes (lopsided or one-armed spirals), suggesting that interactions may be
responsible for at least some of the disklike anti-truncations.",2005-05-11T17:07:07Z
"The light curve of the semiregular variable L2 Puppis: II. Evidence for
  solar-like excitation of the oscillations","We analyse visual observations of the pulsations of the red giant variable L2
Pup. The data cover 77 years between 1927 and 2005, thus providing an extensive
empirical base for characterizing properties of the oscillations. The power
spectrum of the light curve shows a single mode resolved into multiple peaks
under a narrow envelope. We argue that this results from stochastic excitation,
as seen in solar oscillations. The random fluctuations in phase also support
this idea. A comparison with X Cam, a true Mira star with the same pulsation
period, and W Cyg, a true semiregular star, illustrates the basic differences
in phase behaviours. The Mira shows very stable phase, consistent with
excitation by the kappa-mechanism, whereas W Cyg shows large phase fluctuations
that imply stochastic excitation. We find L2 Pup to be intermediate, implying
that both mechanisms play a role in its pulsation. Finally, we also checked the
presence of low-dimensional chaos and could safely exclude it.",2005-07-20T12:55:56Z
"Star Formation and Dust Attenuation Properties in Galaxies from a
  Statistical UV-to-FIR Analysis","We study two galaxy samples selected in ultraviolet (UV) and in far-infrared
(FIR) for which the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far UV (FUV)
to the FIR are available. We compare the observed SEDs to modelled SEDs with
several star formation histories (SFHs; decaying star formation rate plus
burst) and attenuation laws (power law + 2175 Angstroem bump). The Bayesian
method allows to estimate statistically the best parameters by comparing each
observed SED to the full set of 82800 models. We reach the conclusion that the
UV dust attenuation cannot be estimated correctly from an SED analysis if the
FIR information is not used. The deduced dispersion is larger than with the FIR
data and the distribution is not symetrically distributed about zero: there is
an over-estimation for UV-selected galaxies and an under-estimation for
FIR-selected galaxies. The output from the analysis process suggests that
UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in average similar to the LMC
extinction while FIR-selected galaxy attenuation laws more resemble the MW
extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the
Log(Fdust/Ffuv) vs. FUV-NUV diagram (once the main relation with FUV-NUV is
accounted for) is explained by two other parameters: the slope of the
attenuation law and the instantaneous birthrate parameter b_0 for UV-selected
galaxies and the same ones plus the strength of the bump for the FIR-selected
galaxies. We propose a recipe to estimate the UV dust attenuation for
UV-galaxies only (that should be used whenever the FIR information is not
available because the resulting Afuv is poorly defined with an uncertainty of
about 0.32): A_{FUV} = 1.4168 (FUV-NUV)^2 + 0.3298 (NUV-I)^2 + 2.1207 (FUV-NUV)
+ 2.7465 (NUV-I) + 5.8408",2005-04-20T08:42:51Z
Second order perturbation theory for spin-orbit resonances,"We implement Lie transform perturbation theory to second order for the planar
spin-orbit problem. The perturbation parameter is the asphericity of the body,
with the orbital eccentricity entering as an additional parameter. We study
first and second order resonances for different values of these parameters. For
nearly spherical bodies like Mercury and the Moon first order perturbation
theory is adequate, whereas for highly aspherical bodies like Hyperion the spin
is mostly chaotic and perturbation theory is of limited use. However, in
between, we identify a parameter range where second order perturbation theory
is useful and where as yet unidentified objects may be in second order
resonances.",2005-05-27T16:54:56Z
X-ray spectroscopy of PSR B1951+32 and its pulsar wind nebula,"We present spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of PSR B1951+32 and its
pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 80 using a {\sl
Chandra} observation. The {\sl Chandra} X-ray map reveals clearly various
components of a ram-pressure confined PWN embedded in the SNR ejecta: a point
source representing the pulsar, X-ray emission from the bow shock, a luminous
X-ray tail, a 30$\arcsec$ diameter plateau whose northwestern part is absent,
and the outside more diffuse X-ray emission. The plateau is just surrounded by
the radio, [O III], [S II], and [N II] shells, and the outside diffuse emission
is mostly within the H${\alpha}$ shells. While the spectra of all the features
are well fitted with power law models, a power law plus blackbody model can fit
the spectrum of the pulsar significantly better than using a power law model
alone. Generally the spectra of these components obey the trend of steepening
from the inside to the outside. However, the edge of the plateau probably has a
harder spectrum than that of the central region of the plateau. The cause of
the apparent hard spectrum of the plateau edge is unclear, and we speculate
that it might be due to a shock between the PWN and the SNR ejecta. The
possible blackbody radiation component from the pulsar has a temperature of
0.13$\pm0.02$ keV and an equivalent emitting radius of 2.2$^{+1.4}_{-0.8}$ (d/2
kpc) km, and is thus probably from the hot spots on the pulsar. We also show in
this paper that the blackbody temperature of the entire surface of PSR B1951+32
is much lower than those predicted by the standard neutron star cooling models.",2005-04-13T10:26:31Z
Radio Spectral Index Study of the SNRs OA184 and VRO42.05.01,"New images of the Supernova Remnants (SNRs) OA184 and VRO42.05.01 are
presented at 408 MHz and 1420 MHz, from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey
(CGPS) data. The SNRs' flux densities at both 408 MHz and 1420 MHz are found
and corrected for flux from compact sources within the SNRs. The integrated
flux-density based spectral indices (S$_{\nu}$$\propto$$\nu$$^{-\alpha}$) are
0.25+-0.03 for OA184 and 0.36+-0.06 for VRO42.05.01. These agree with the
respective T-T plot spectral indexes of 0.23+-0.06 and 0.36+-0.03. OA184's
spectral index is smaller than previously published values. The older flux
density values of OA184 from lower resolution data include a contribution from
a non-SNR ridge emission region and from compact sources within OA184.
Subtracting these contributions results in a spectral index of 0.32+-0.06 (38
MHz to 2695 MHz) or 0.28+-0.06 (408 MHz to 2695 MHz). Correction of published
fluxes for point sources for VRO.42.05.01 results in a spectral index of
0.32+-0.05 for 38 MHz to 2695 MHz. We also find spatial variations of spectral
index. For OA184 $\alpha$ varies from 0.1 to 0.3 (with errors $\simeq$0.1). For
VRO42.05.01, the shell region has $\alpha$=0.31 and the wing region has
$\alpha=0.47$ (with errors $\simeq$0.03).",2005-05-24T21:27:11Z
Are radio pulsars progenitors of AXPs and SGRs?,"Possibility of realization of scenario for the AXPs and SGRs origins from
radio pulsars, which were undergone frequent and strong glitches, was analyzed.
It is shown that the characteristics of such pulsars - the possible progenitors
of AXPs and SGRs - their association with supernova remnants (SNRs) and
evolution on the $P - \dot P$ diagram, taking into account their real ages,
conflict with offered scenario.",2005-07-21T10:53:09Z
"The obscuration by dust of most of the growth of supermassive black
  holes","Supermassive black holes underwent periods of exponential growth during which
we seem them as quasars in the distant Universe. The summed emission from these
quasars generates the cosmic X-ray background, the spectrum of which has been
used to argue that most black-hole growth is obscured. There are clear examples
of obscured black-hole growth in the form of `type-2' quasars, but their
numbers are fewer than expected from modelling of the X-ray background. Here we
report on the direct detection of a population of distant type-2 quasars which
is at least comparable in size to the well-known unobscured type-1 population.
We selected objects that have mid-infrared and radio emissions characteristic
of quasars, but which are faint at near-infrared and optical wavelengths. This
population is responsible for most of the black hole growth in the young
Universe and, throughout cosmic history, black-hole growth occurs in the dusty,
gas-rich centres of active galaxies.",2005-05-24T09:14:07Z
"Binary Quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Evidence for Excess
  Clustering on Small Scales","We present a sample of 218 new quasar pairs with proper transverse
separations R_prop < 1 Mpc/h over the redshift range 0.5 < z < 3.0, discovered
from an extensive follow up campaign to find companions around the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey and 2dF Quasar Redshift Survey quasars. This sample includes
26 new binary quasars with separations R_prop < 50 kpc/h (theta < 10
arcseconds), more than doubling the number of such systems known. We define a
statistical sample of binaries selected with homogeneous criteria and compute
its selection function, taking into account sources of incompleteness. The
first measurement of the quasar correlation function on scales 10 kpc/h <
R_prop < 400 kpc/h is presented. For R_prop < 40 kpc/h, we detect an order of
magnitude excess clustering over the expectation from the large scale R_prop >
3 Mpc/h quasar correlation function, extrapolated down as a power law to the
separations probed by our binaries. The excess grows to ~ 30 at R_prop ~ 10
kpc/h, and provides compelling evidence that the quasar autocorrelation
function gets progressively steeper on sub-Mpc scales. This small scale excess
can likely be attributed to dissipative interaction events which trigger quasar
activity in rich environments. Recent small scale measurements of galaxy
clustering and quasar-galaxy clustering are reviewed and discussed in relation
to our measurement of small scale quasar clustering.",2005-04-25T09:42:33Z
Comparisons of an Evolutionary Chemical Model with Other Models,"We compare an evolutionary chemical model with simple empirical models of the
abundance and with static chemical models. We focus on the prediction of
molecular line profiles that are commonly observed in low mass star forming
cores. We show that empirical models can be used to constrain evaporation radii
and infall radii using lines of some species. Species with more complex
abundance profiles are not well represented by the empirical models. Static
chemical models produce abundance profiles different from those obtained from
an evolutionary calculation because static models do not account for the flow
of matter inward from the outer regions. The resulting profiles of lines used
to probe infall may differ substantially.",2005-06-03T18:33:33Z
"An Analysis of the Shapes of Ultraviolet Extinction Curves. IV.
  Extinction without Standards","We present a new method for deriving UV-through-IR extinction curves, based
on the use of stellar atmosphere models to provide estimates of the intrinsic
(i.e., unreddened) stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs), rather than
unreddened (or lightly reddened) standard stars. We show that this
``extinction-without-standards'' technique greatly increases the accuracy of
the derived extinction curves and allows realistic estimations of the
uncertainties. An additional benefit of the technique is that it simultaneously
determines the fundamental properties of the reddened stars themselves, making
the procedure valuable for both stellar and interstellar studies. We
demonstrate how the extinction-without-standards curves make it possible to: 1)
study the uniformity of extinction in localized spatial regions with
unprecedented precision; 2) determine the relationships between different
aspects of curve morphology; 3) produce high quality extinction curves from low
color excess sightlines; and 4) derive reliable extinction curves for mid-late
B stars, thereby increasing spatial coverage and allowing the study of
extinction in open clusters and associations dominated by such stars. The
application of this technique to the available database of UV-through-IR SEDs,
and to future observations, will provide valuable constraints on the nature of
interstellar grains and on the processes which modify them, and will enhance
our ability to remove the multi-wavelength effects of extinction from
astronomical energy distributions.",2005-06-17T15:21:28Z
Reconnection at the Heliopause,"In this MHD-model of the heliosphere, we assume a Parker-type flow, and a
Parker-type spiral magnetic field, which is extrapolated further downstream
from the termination shock to the heliopause. We raise the question whether the
heliopause nose region may be leaky with respect to fields and plasmas due to
nonideal plasma dynamics, implying a breakdown of the magnetic barrier. We
analyse some simple scenarios to find reconnection rates and circumstances,
under which the heliosphere can be an ""open"" or a ""closed"" magnetosphere. We do
not pretend to offer a complete solution for the heliosphere, on the basis of
nonideal MHD theory, but present a prescription to find such a solution on the
basis of potential fields including the knowledge of neutral points. As an
example we imitate the Parker spiral as a monopole with a superposition of
homogeneous asymptotical boundary conditions. We use this toy model for x < -R
where R = 100 AU is the distance of the termination shock to describe the
situation in the nose region of the heliopause.",2005-05-27T13:52:49Z
"Discovery of a redshifted X-ray emission line in the symbiotic neutron
  star binary 4U 1700+24","We present the spectral analysis of an XMM-Newton observation of the X-ray
binary 4U 1700+24, performed during an outburst in August 2002. The EPIC-PN
spectrum above 1 keV can be modeled by a blackbody plus Comptonization model,
as in previous observations. At lower energies, however, we detect a prominent
soft excess, which we model with a broad Gaussian centered at ~0.5 keV. In the
high resolution RGS spectrum we detect a single emission line, centered at
19.19^{+0.05}_{-0.09} \AA. We discuss two possible interpretations for this
line: O VIII at redshift z=0.012^{+0.002}_{-0.004} or Ne IX at redshift z~0.4.",2005-06-24T12:33:00Z
"Probing Dark Energy via Weak Gravitational Lensing with the SuperNova
  Acceleration Probe (SNAP)","SNAP is a candidate for the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) that seeks to
place constraints on the dark energy using two distinct methods. The first,
Type Ia SN, is discussed in a companion white paper. The second method is weak
gravitational lensing, which relies on the coherent distortions in the shapes
of background galaxies by foreground mass structures. The excellent spatial
resolution and photometric accuracy afforded by a 2-meter space-based
observatory are crucial for achieving the high surface density of resolved
galaxies, the tight control of systematic errors in the telescope's Point
Spread Function (PSF), and the exquisite redshift accuracy and depth required
by this project. These are achieved by the elimination of atmospheric
distortion and much of the thermal and gravity loads on the telescope. The SN
and WL methods for probing dark energy are highly complementary and the error
contours from the two methods are largely orthogonal.",2005-07-19T20:41:07Z
"Detection and imaging of atmospheric radio flashes from cosmic ray air
  showers","The nature of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies >10^20 eV
remains a mystery. They are likely to be of extragalactic origin, but should be
absorbed within ~50 Mpc through interactions with the cosmic microwave
background. As there are no sufficient powerful accelerators within this
distance from the Galaxy, explanations for UHECRs range from unusual
astrophysical sources to exotic string physics. Also unclear is whether UHECRs
consist of protons, heavy nuclei, neutrinos or gamma-rays. To resolve these
questions, larger detectors with higher duty cycles and which combine multiple
detection techniques are needed. Radio emission from UHECRs, on the other hand,
is unaffected by attenuation, has a high duty cycle, gives calorimetric
measurements and provides high directional accuracy. Here we report the
detection of radio flashes from cosmic-ray air showers using low-cost digital
radio receivers. We show that the radiation can be understood in terms of the
geosynchrotron effect. Our results show that it should be possible to determine
the nature and composition of UHECRs with combined radio and particle
detectors, and to detect the ultrahigh-energy neutrinos expected from flavour
mixing.",2005-05-18T17:20:35Z
High energy neutrinos from fast spinning magnetars,"Fast spinning magnetars are discussed as strong sources of high energy
neutrinos. Pulsars may be born with a short rotation period of milliseconds
with the magnetic field amplified through dynamo processes up to $\sim
10^{15}-10^{16} \rm G$. As such millisecond magnetars (MSMs) have an enormous
spin-down power $\sim 10^{50} {\rm erg} {\rm s}^{-1}$, they can be potentially
a strong, extragalactic high-energy neutrino source. Specifically, acceleration
of ions and subsequent photomeson production within the MSM magnetosphere are
considered. As in normal pulsars, particle acceleration leads to
electron-positron pair cascades that constrains the acceleration efficiency.
The limit on the neutrino power as a fraction of the spin-down power is
calculated. It is shown that neutrinos produced in the inner magnetosphere have
characteristic energy about a few $\times100$ GeV due to the constraint of
cooling of charged pions through inverse Compton scattering. TeV neutrinos may
be produced in the outer magnetosphere where ions can be accelerated to much
higher energies and the pion cooling is less severe than in the inner
magnetosphere. High energy neutrinos can also be produced from interactions
between ultra-high energy protons accelerated in the magnetosphere and a
diffuse thermal radiation from the ejecta or from the interaction region
between the MSM wind and remnant shell. The detectability of neutrinos in the
early spin-down phase by the current available and planned neutrino detectors
is discussed.",2005-07-18T02:22:30Z
"Luminosity-dependent evolution of soft X-ray selected AGN: New Chandra
  and XMM-Newton surveys","We present new results on the cosmological evolution of unabsorbed (type-1)
active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected in the soft (0.5-2 keV) X-ray band. From
a variety of ROSAT, XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys we selected a total of ~1000
AGN with an unprecedented spectroscopic and photometric optical/NIR
identification completeness. For the first time we are able to derive reliable
space densities for low-luminosity (Seyfert-type) X-ray sources at cosmological
redshifts. The evolutionary behaviour of AGN shows a strong dependence on X-ray
luminosity: while the space density of high-luminosity AGN reaches a peak
around z~2, similar to that of optically selected QSO, the space density of
low-luminosity AGNs peaks at redshifts below z=1. This confirms previous ROSAT
findings of a luminosity-dependent density evolution. Using a rigorous
treatment of the optical identification completeness we are able to show that
the space density of AGN with X-ray luminosities L_x < 10^45 erg s^-1 declines
significantly towards high redshifts.",2005-06-06T17:38:13Z
"Searching for the Sources Responsible for Cosmic Reionization: Probing 7
  < z < 10 and Beyond","(Abridged) We review recent observations that suggest the star formation rate
density is declining over 3$<z<$7 and illustrate the challenges that this poses
in explaining the assembled stellar mass in z$\sim$6 galaxies deduced from
Spitzer data. A plausible conclusion is a vigorous period of earlier star
formation. Prior to JWST and TMT, strong lensing offers a unique probe of the
extent of this earlier activity. We discuss the first results of a blind
spectroscopic survey of lensing clusters for 8.5$<z<$10 Ly$\alpha$ emitters
using NIRSPEC which is achieving a limiting star formation rate of 0.1
$M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. A companion HST/IRAC survey is targeting lensed $z$ and
$J$-band dropouts and probes a $\simeq$1 arcmin$^2$ region 1 magnitude deeper
than the UDF/NICMOS observations. Both surveys will constrain the contribution
of early, low luminosity, sources to cosmic reionization.",2005-08-04T06:13:45Z
GCRT J1745-3009: A precessing radio pulsar?,"A unique transient bursting radio source, GCRT J1745-3009, has been
discovered (Hyman et al. 2005a) near the direction of the Galactic center. It
is still an open question to explain this phenomenon, although some efforts to
understand its nature have been made. This paper shows that most of the
observed features can be reproduced by our proposed precessing pulsar model. It
is found that the precession angle of the pulsar should be larger ($\ga 15^{\rm
o}$) than that of previously known precessing pulsars, which have a precession
angle $\la 10^{\rm o}$, if the beam width of the pulsar is larger than 10
degree. The pulsar could be a nulling (or even extremely) radio pulsars to
account for the transient nature of the source. This model can be confirmed if
a pulsar is detected at the position of the source. The pulsar could hardly be
a normal neutron star (but probably a solid quark star) if the spin period of
the pulsar is detected to be $\ga 10$ ms in the future.",2005-04-11T19:31:40Z
"SnIa Constraints on the event-horizon Thermodynamical model of Dark
  Energy","We apply the thermodynamical model of the cosmological event horizon of the
spatially flat FLRW metrics to the study of the recent accelerated expansion
phase and to the coincidence problem. This model, called ""ehT model"" hereafter,
led to a dark energy (DE) density $\Lambda $ varying as $r^{-2},$ where $r$ is
the proper radius of the event horizon. Recently, another model motivated by
the holographic principle gave an independent justification of the same
relation between $\Lambda $ and $r$. We probe the theoretical results of the
ehT model with respect to the SnIa observations and we compare it to the model
deduced from the holographic principle, which we call ""LHG model"" in the
following.Our results are in excellent agreement with the observations for
$H\_{0}=64kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}$, and $\Omega \_{\Lambda
}^{0}=0.63\_{-0.01}^{+0.1}$, which leads to $q\_{0}=-0.445$ and $z\_{T}\simeq

"What are the temperatures of T Tauri stars? - Constraints from coeval
  formation of young eclipsing binaries","We show how the assumption of coeval formation can be used to constrain the
effective temperatures of the components of young eclipsing double-lined
spectroscopic binaries. Our method extends the approach of White et al. (1999)
to a two-step analysis. The first step compares evolutionary models to the
observed masses and radii and selects those models that predict ages that are
consistent with coeval formation. The second step then uses these models to
constrain the effective temperatures. We applied the method on literature
values of the stellar parameters of the eclipsing binaries RX J0529.4+0041 A
and V1174 Ori and confirm that V1174 Ori A has dwarf-like temperatures at an
age of 9 Myrs, while we cannot draw any conclusions for RX J0529.4+0041 A and
V1174 Ori B. Considering these binaries, we find that none of the evolutionary
models gives coeval solutions simultaneously in mass, radius and effective
temperature.",2005-06-30T18:13:34Z
"Near-Infrared photometry of four metal-rich Bulge globular clusters:

globular clusters, namely: NGC 6304, NGC 6569, NGC 6637 and NGC 6638. By using
the observed Colour-Magnitude Diagrams we derived a photometric estimates of
the cluster reddening and distance. We performed a detailed analysis of the Red

"Chemical Composition in the Globular Cluster M71 from Keck/HIRES Spectra
  of Turn-Off Stars","We have made observations with the Keck I telescope and HIRES at a resolution
of $\sim$45,000 of five nearly identical stars at the turn-off of the
metal-rich globular cluster M 71. Our mean Fe abundance, [Fe/H]=-0.80 +-0.02,
is in excellent agreement with previous cluster determinations from both giants
and near-turnoff stars. There is no clear evidence for any star-to-star
abundance differences or correlations in our sample. Abundance ratios of the
Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni) are similar to Fe. The turn-off stars in M71 have
remarkably consistent enhancements of 0.2 - 0.3 dex in [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe] and
[Ti/Fe] -- like the red giants. Our [Mg/Fe] ratio is somewhat lower than that
suggested by other studies. We compare our mean abundances for the five M 71
stars with field stars of similar [Fe/H] -- 8 with halo kinematics and 17 with
disk kinematics. The abundances of the alpha-fusion products (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti)
agree with both samples, but seem a closer match to the disk stars. The Mg
abundance in M71 is at the lower edge of the disk and halo samples. The
neutron-capture elements, Y and Ba, are enhanced relative to solar in the M71
turn-off stars. Our ratio [Ba/Fe] is similar to that of the halo field stars
but a factor of two above that for the disk field stars. The important [Ba/Y]
ratio is significantly lower than M71 giant values. The Na content of the M71
turn-off stars is remarkably similar to that in the disk field stars, but more
than a factor of two higher than the halo field star sample. We find [Na/Fe] =
+0.14 $\pm$0.04 with a spread less than half of that found in the red giants in
M71. Excluding Mg, the lack of intracluster $\alpha$-element variations
(turn-off vs giants) suggests the polluting material arose in a more

An XMM-Newton Study of the Coronae of $σ^2$ Coronae Borealis,"(Abridged) We present results of XMM-Newton observations of the RS CVn binary
$\sigma^2$ Coronae Borealis. The RGS and EPIC MOS2 spectra were simultaneously
fitted with collisional ionization equilibrium plasma models to determine
coronal abundances of various elements. Contrary to the solar first ionization
potential (FIP) effect in which elements with a low FIP are overabundant in the
corona compared to the solar photosphere, and contrary to the ``inverse'' FIP
effect observed in several active RS CVn binaries, coronal abundance ratios in
$\sigma^2$ CrB show a complex pattern as supported by similar findings in the
Chandra HETGS analysis of $\sigma^2$ CrB with a different methodology (Osten et
al. 2003). Low-FIP elements ($<10$ eV) have their abundance ratios relative to
Fe consistent with the solar photospheric ratios, whereas high-FIP elements
have their abundance ratios increase with increasing FIP. We find that the
coronal Fe abundance is consistent with the stellar photospheric value,
indicating that there is no metal depletion in $\sigma^2$ CrB. However, we
obtain a higher Fe absolute abundance than in Osten et al. (2003). Except for
Ar and S, our absolute abundances are about 1.5 times larger than those
reported by Osten et al. (2003). However, a comparison of their model with our
XMM-Newton data (and vice versa) shows that both models work adequately in
general. We find, therefore, no preference for one methodology over the other
to derive coronal abundances. Despite the systematic discrepancy in absolute
abundances, our abundance ratios are very close to those obtained by Osten et
al. (2003). Finally, we confirm the measurement of a low density in \ion{O}{7}
($< 4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), but could not confirm the higher densities
measured in spectral lines formed at higher temperatures.",2005-06-10T16:03:24Z
"Inferences from pulsational amplitudes and phases for multimode $δ$
  Sct star FG Vir","We combine photometric and spectroscopic data on twelve modes excited in FG
Vir to determine their spherical harmonic degrees, $\ell$, and to obtain
constraints on the star model. The effective temperature consistent with the
mean colours and the pulsation data is about 7200K. In six cases, the $\ell$
identification is unique with above 80 % probability. Two modes are identified
as radial. Simultaneously with $\ell$, we determine a complex parameter $f$
which probes subphotospheric stellar layers. Comparing its values with those
derived from models assuming different treatment of convection, we find
evidence that convective transport in the envelope of this star is inefficient.",2005-04-07T10:32:14Z
"Chandra Observation of the Cluster of Galaxies MS 0839.9+2938 at
  z=0.194: the Central Excess Iron and SN Ia Enrichment","We present the Chandra study of the intermediately distant cluster of
galaxies MS 0839.9+2938. By performing both the projected and deprojected
spectral analyses, we find that the gas temperature is approximately constant
at about 4 keV in 130-444h_70^-1 kpc. In the inner regions, the gas temperature
descends towards the center, reaching <~ 3 keV in the central 37h_70^-1 kpc.
This infers that the lower and upper limits of the mass deposit rate are 9-34
M_sun yr^-1 and 96-126 M_sun yr^-1, respectively within 74h_70^-1 kpc where the
gas is significantly colder. Along with the temperature drop, we detect a
significant inward iron abundance increase from about 0.4 solar in the outer
regions to about 1 solar within the central 37h_70^-1 kpc. Thus MS 0839.9+2938
is the cluster showing the most significant central iron excess at z>~ 0.2. We
argue that most of the excess iron should have been contributed by SNe Ia. By
utilizing the observed SN Ia rate and stellar mass loss rate, we estimate that
the time needed to enrich the central region with excess iron is 6.4-7.9 Gyr,
which is similar to those found for the nearby clusters. Coinciding with the
optical extension of the cD galaxy (up to about 30h_70^-1 kpc), the observed
X-ray surface brightness profile exhibits an excess beyond the distribution
expected by either the beta model or the NFW model, and can be well fitted with
an empirical two-beta model that leads to a relatively flatter mass profile in
the innermost region.",2005-06-12T10:16:34Z
The sensitivity of Lick indices to abundance variations,"We present results of model atmosphere/line formation calculations which
quantitatively test how the 21 classical and four higher-order Balmer-line
Lick/IDS indices (Worthey et al. 1994; Worthey & Ottaviani 1997) depend on
individual elemental abundances (of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, magnesium, iron,
calcium, natrium, silicon, chromium, titanium) and overall metallicity in
various stellar evolutionary stages and at various metallicities. At low
metallicities the effects of an overall enhancement of alpha-elements are also
investigated. The general results obtained by Tripicco & Bell (1995) at solar
metallicity are confirmed, while details do differ. Tables are given detailing
to which element every index reacts significantly, as a function of
evolutionary stage and composition.
  This work validates a number of assumptions implicitly made in the stellar
population models of Thomas, Maraston & Bender (2003), which utilized the
results of Tripicco & Bell (1995) to include the effects of element abundance
ratios variations. In particular, these computations confirm that fractional
changes to index strengths computed at solar metallicity (and solar age) can be
applied over a wide range of abundances and ages, also to model old stellar
populations with non-solar abundance ratios. The use of metallicity-dependent
response functions is, however, required for the proper modelling of the
Balmer-line indices. While H beta still responds only moderately to abundance
ratio variations, the higher-order Balmer indices H gamma and H delta display
very strong dependencies at high metallicities. As shown in Thomas, Maraston &
Korn (2004), this result allows to remove systematic effects in age
determinations based on different Balmer-line indices. (abridged)",2005-04-26T13:30:15Z
"R-Process Nucleosynthesis in MHD Jet Explosions of Core-Collapse
  Supernovae","We investigate $r$-process nucleosynthesis during the magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) explosion of supernova in a massive star of 13 $M_{\odot}$. Contrary to
the case of the spherical explosion, jet-like explosion due to the combined
effects of the rotation and magnetic field lowers the electron fraction
significantly inside the layers above the iron core. We find that the ejected
material of low electron fraction responsible for the $r$-process comes out
from the silicon rich layer of the presupernova model. This leads to the
production up to the third peak in the solar $r$-process elements. We examine
whether the fission affects the $r$-process paths by using the full nuclear
reaction network with both the spontaneous and $\beta$-delayed fission
included. Moreover, we pay particular attention how the mass formula affects
the $r$-process peaks with use of two mass formulae. It is found that both
formulae can reproduce the global abundance pattern up to the third peak though
detailed distributions are rather different. We point out that there are
variations in the $r$-process nucleosynthesis if the MHD effects play an
important role in the supernova explosion.",2005-04-05T09:02:15Z
A resolved outflow of matter from a Brown Dwarf,"The birth of stars involves not only accretion but also, counter-intuitively,
the expulsion of matter in the form of highly supersonic outflows. Although
this phenomenon has been seen in young stars, a fundamental question is whether
it also occurs amongst newborn brown dwarfs: these are the so-called 'failed
stars', with masses between stars and planets, that never manage to reach
temperatures high enough for normal hydrogen fusion to occur. Recently,
evidence for accretion in young brown dwarfs has mounted, and their spectra
show lines that are suggestive of outflows. Here we report spectro-astrometric
data that spatially resolve an outflow from a brown dwarf. The outflow's
characteristics appear similar to, but on a smaller scale than, outflows from
normal young stars. This result suggests that the outflow mechanism is
universal, and perhaps relevant even to the formation of planets.",2005-06-21T11:34:58Z
IMF biases and how to correct them,"We discuss possible sources of biases in the determination of the initial
mass function (IMF) introduced by the binning of the data, the uncertainty in
the determinations of masses, and the existence of unresolved multiple systems.
Those three effects tend to produce IMFs that are flatter than the real one. We
analyze the importance of each effect and suggest techniques that minimize or
eliminate the biases. We also report the detection of the first astrometric
binary system composed of two very-early O-type stars, HD 93129 A.",2005-06-13T18:05:45Z
The Ups and Downs of Baryon Oscillations,"Baryon acoustic oscillations, measured through the patterned distribution of
galaxies or other baryon tracing objects on very large (100 Mpc) scales, offer
a possible geometric probe of cosmological distances. Pluses and minuses in
this approach's leverage for understanding dark energy are discussed, as are
systematic uncertainties requiring further investigation. Conclusions are that
1) BAO offer promise of a new avenue to distance measurements and further study
is warranted, 2) the measurements will need to attain ~1% accuracy (requiring a
10000 square degree spectroscopic survey) for their dark energy leverage to
match that from supernovae, but do give complementary information at 2%
accuracy. Because of the ties to the matter dominated era, BAO is not a
replacement probe of dark energy, but a valuable complement.",2005-07-12T22:34:59Z
"Low-Luminosity AGN as analogues of Galactic Black Holes in the low/hard
  state: Evidence from X-ray timing of NGC 4258","We present a broadband power spectral density function (PSD) measured from
extensive RXTE monitoring data of the low-luminosity AGN NGC 4258, which has an
accurate, maser-determined black hole mass of 3.9+/-0.1 * 10^7 solar masses. We
constrain the PSD break timescale to be greater than 4.5 d at >90% confidence,
which appears to rule out the possibility that NGC 4258 is an analogue of black
hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in the high/soft state. In this sense, the PSD of
NGC 4258 is different to those of some more-luminous Seyferts, which appear
similar to the PSDs of high/soft state X-ray binaries. This result supports
previous analogies between LLAGN and X-ray binaries in the low/hard state based
on spectral energy distributions, indicating that the AGN/BHXRB analogy is
valid across a broad range of accretion rates.",2005-04-06T15:49:10Z
"Giant Planet Migration through the Action of Disk Torques and Planet
  Scattering","This paper presents a parametric study of giant planet migration through the
combined action of disk torques and planet-planet scattering. The torques
exerted on planets during Type II migration in circumstellar disks readily
decrease the semi-major axes, whereas scattering between planets increases the
orbital eccentricities. This paper presents a parametric exploration of the
possible parameter space for this migration scenario using two (initial)
planetary mass distributions and a range of values for the time scale of
eccentricity damping (due to the disk). For each class of systems, many
realizations of the simulations are performed in order to determine the
distributions of the resulting orbital elements of the surviving planets; this
paper presents the results of 8500 numerical experiments. Our goal is to study
the physics of this particular migration mechanism and to test it against
observations of extrasolar planets. The action of disk torques and
planet-planet scattering results in a distribution of final orbital elements
that fills the a-e plane, in rough agreement with the orbital elements of
observed extrasolar planets. In addition to specifying the orbital elements, we
characterize this migration mechanism by finding the percentages of ejected and
accreted planets, the number of collisions, the dependence of outcomes on
planetary masses, the time spent in 2:1 and 3:1 resonances, and the effects of
the planetary IMF. We also determine the distribution of inclination angles of
surviving planets and the distribution of ejection speeds for exiled planets.",2005-05-11T19:59:47Z
"On the relationship between auroral and nebular oxygen line intensities
  in spectra of HII regions","We investigate relationships between observed auroral and nebular oxygen line
fluxes in spectra of HII regions. We find a relation that is
metallicity-dependent at low metallicities, but becomes independent of
metallicity (within the uncertainties of the available data) above 12+logO/H ~
8.25, i.e. there is one-to-one correspondance (the ff - relation) between
auroral and nebular oxygen line fluxes in spectra of high-metallicity HII
regions. The ff - relation allows one to estimate the flux in the auroral line
from strong oxygen line measurements. This solves the problem of the electron
temperature (and, consequently, abundance) determination in high-metallicity
HII regions. The ff - relation confirms the basic idea of the empirical method,
proposed by Pagel et al. (1979) a qurter of a century ago, that the oxygen
abundance in HII region can be estimated from the strong oxygen lines
measurements only.",2005-04-18T11:10:20Z
On virialization with dark energy,"We review the inclusion of dark energy into the formalism of spherical
collapse, and the virialization of a two-component system, made of matter and
dark energy. We compare two approaches in previous studies. The first assumes
that only the matter component virializes, e.g. as in the case of a classic
cosmological constant. The second approach allows the full system to virialize
as a whole. We show that the two approaches give fundamentally different
results for the final state of the system. This might be a signature
discriminating between the classic cosmological constant which cannot virialize
and a dynamical dark energy mimicking a cosmological constant. This signature
is independent of the measured value of the equation of state. An additional
issue which we address is energy non-conservation of the system, which
originates from the homogeneity assumption for the dark energy. We propose a
way to take this energy loss into account.",2005-05-14T13:56:17Z
Gamma-ray and neutrino emission from misaligned microquasars,"Microquasars are accreting X-ray binary systems with non-thermal radio jets.
In some of these systems the jet is expected to be strongly misaligned with the
perpendicular to the orbital plane. If the donor star is an early-type star,
the jet could collide with the stellar wind producing a standing shock between
the compact object and the stellar surface. Relativistic particles injected by
the jet can be re-accelerated and isotropized at the colliding region. If the
jet has hadronic content, TeV protons will diffuse into the inner, dense wind
leading to gamma-ray and neutrino production from interactions with the matter
of the wind. In the case of very powerful jets, the wind pressure can be
overbalanced and the jet might impact directly onto the stellar surface. We
present estimates of the gamma-ray and neutrino luminosities for different sets
of parameters in these scenarios and we briefly discuss the effects of this
radiation on the donor star and its detectability with current instruments.",2005-05-13T15:15:22Z
"Rates of Neutrino Absorption on Nucleons and the Reverse Processes in
  Strong Magnetic Fields","The rates of electron neutrino capture on neutron, electron anti-neutrino
capture on proton, and their reverse processes are important for understanding
the production of heavy elements in the supernova environment above the
protoneutron star. Observations and theoretical considerations suggest that
some protoneutron stars may be born with strong magnetic fields. We develop a
numerical method to calculate the above rates in supernova environments with
magnetic fields up to 10^16 G. This method is accurate to the order of one over
nucleon mass. We show that our results have the correct behavior in the limit
of high neutrino energy or small magnetic field. Based on comparison of our
results with various approximations, we recommend efficient estimates of the
above rates for use in models of supernova nucleosynthesis in the presence of
strong magnetic fields.",2005-06-01T20:26:43Z
"A New Relation between GRB Rest-Frame Spectra and Energetics and Its
  Utility on Cosmology","We investigate the well-measured spectral and energetic properties of 20
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in their cosmological rest frames. We find a tight
relation between the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy Eiso, the local peak
energy E'p of the \nu F_{\nu} spectrum, and the local break time t'b of the GRB
afterglow light curve, which reads Eiso*t'b\propto E'p^{1.95\pm0.08}
(\chi^2_\nu=1.40; Omega_M=0.27, Omega_Lambda=0.73). Such a power-law relation
can be understood via the high-energy radiation processes for the GRB prompt
emission accompanying the beaming effects. We then consider this relation as an
intrinsic one for the observed GRB sample, and obtain a constraint on the mass
density Omega_M=0.24^{+0.16}_{-0.12} (1\sigma) for a flat Lambda-CDM universe,
and a \chi^2_{dof}=1.33 for Omega_M\approx0.3 and Omega_Lambda\approx0.7.
Ongoing GRB observations in the Swift era are expected to confirm this relation
and make its cosmological utility progress much.",2005-04-03T11:02:35Z
"ISO observations of the Wolf-Rayet galaxies NGC 5430, NGC 6764, Mrk 309
  and VII Zw 19","Observations of four WR galaxies (NGC 5430, NGC 6764, Mrk 309 and VII Zw 19)
using the Infrared Space Observatory are presented here. ISOCAM maps of NGC
5430, Mrk 309 and NGC 6764 revealed the location of star formation regions in
each of these galaxies. ISOPHOT spectral observations from 4 to 12 microns
detected the ubiquitous PAH bands in the nuclei of the targets and several of
the disk star forming regions, while LWS spectroscopy detected [OI] and [CII]
emission lines from two galaxies, NGC 5430 and NGC 6764.
  Using a combination of ISO and IRAS flux densities, a dust model based on the
sum of modified blackbody components was successfully fitted to the available
data. These models were then used to calculate new values for the total IR
luminosities for each galaxy, the size of the various dust populations, and the
global SFR.
  The derived flux ratios, the SFRs, the high L(PAH)/L(40-120 microns) and
F(PAH 7.7 microns)/F(7.7 microns continuum) values suggest that most of these
galaxies are home to only a compact burst of star formation. The exception is
NGC 6764, whose F(PAH 7.7 microns)/F(7.7 microns continuum) value of 1.22 is
consistent with the presence of an AGN, yet the L(PAH)/L(40-120 microns) is
more in line with a starburst, a finding in line with a compact low-luminosity
AGN dominated by the starburst.",2005-06-01T21:57:39Z
Identifying Near Earth Object Families,"The study of asteroid families has provided tremendous insight into the
forces that sculpted the main belt and continue to drive the collisional and
dynamical evolution of asteroids. The identification of asteroid families
within the NEO population could provide a similar boon to studies of their
formation and interiors. In this study we examine the purported identification
of NEO families by Drummond (2000) and conclude that it is unlikely that they
are anything more than random fluctuations in the distribution of NEO
osculating orbital elements. We arrive at this conclusion after examining the
expected formation rate of NEO families, the identification of NEO groups in
synthetic populations that contain no genetically related NEOs, the orbital
evolution of the largest association identified by Drummond (2000), and the
decoherence of synthetic NEO families intended to reproduce the observed
members of the same association. These studies allowed us to identify a new
criterion that can be used to select real NEO families for further study in
future analyses, based on the ratio of the number of pairs and the size of
strings to the number of objects in an identified association.",2005-05-12T23:11:58Z
Stability of strange stars (SS) under radial oscillation,"A realistic Equation of State (EOS) leads to strange stars (ReSS) which are
compact in the mass radius plot, close to the Schwarzchild limiting line (Dey
et al. 1998). We carry out a stability analysis under radial oscillations and
compare with the EOS of other SS models. We find that the ReSS is stable and an
M-R region can be identified to that effect.",2005-03-17T03:38:04Z
"Erupting Cataclysmic Variable Stars in the Nearest Globular Cluster, NGC
  6397: Intermediate Polars?","NGC 6397 is the closest globular cluster, and hence the ideal place to search
for faint stellar populations such as cataclysmic variables (CVs). HST and
Chandra observers have identified nine certain and likely CVs in this nearby
cluster, including several magnetic CV candidates. We have combined our recent
UV imagery with archival HST images of NGC 6397 to search for new CV candidates
and especially to look for dwarf nova-like eruptive events. We find remarkable
and somewhat unexpected dwarf nova-like eruptions of the two well-known
cataclysmic systems CV2 and CV3. These two objects have been claimed to be {\it
magnetic} CVs, as indicated by their helium emission-line spectra. Magnetic
fields in CVs are usually expected to prevent the disk instability that leads
to dwarf nova eruptions. In fact, most field magnetic CVs are observed to not
undergo eruptions. Our observations of the dwarf nova eruptions of CV2 and CV3
can be reconciled with these objects' HeII emission lines if both objects are
infrequently-erupting intermediate polars, similar to EX Hya. If this is the
case for most globular cluster CVs then we can reconcile the many X-ray and UV
bright CV candidates seen by Chandra and HST with the very small numbers of
erupting dwarf novae observed in cluster cores.",2005-06-28T22:29:09Z
"The Cornell High-order Adaptive Optics Survey for Brown Dwarfs in
  Stellar Systems-I: Observations, Data Reduction, and Detection Analysis","In this first of a two-paper sequence, we report techniques and results of
the Cornell High-order Adaptive Optics Survey for brown dwarf companions
(CHAOS). At the time of this writing, this study represents the most sensitive
published population survey of brown dwarf companions to main sequence stars,
for separation akin to our own outer solar system. The survey, conducted using
the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope, consists of K-short coronagraphic
observations of 80 main sequence stars out to 22 parsecs. At 1 arcsecond
separations from a typical target system, the survey achieves median
sensitivities 10 magnitudes fainter than the parent star. In terms of companion
mass, the survey achieves typical sensitivities of 25 Jupiter masses (1 Gyr),
50 Jupiter masses (solar age), and 60 Jupiter masses (10 Gyr), using
evolutionary models of Baraffe et al. (2003). Using common proper motion to
distinguish companions from field stars, we find that no systems show positive
evidence of a substellar companion (searchable separation 1-15 arcseconds
[projected separation ~ 10-155 AU at the median target distance]). In the
second paper of the series we shall present our Monte Carlo population
simulations.",2005-06-13T19:30:03Z
Effects of photon escape on diagnostic diagrams for HII regions,"In this article we first outline the mounting evidence that a significant
fraction of the ionizing photons emitted by OB stars within HII regions escape
from their immediate surroundings and explain how an HII region structure
containing high density contrast in homogeneities facilitates this escape. Next
we describe sets of models containing inhomogeneities which are used to predict
tracks in the commonly used diagnostic diagrams (based on ratios of emission
lines) whose only independent variable is the photon escape fraction, xi. We
show that the tracks produced by the models in two of the most cited of these
diagrams conform well to the distribution of observed data points, with the
models containing optically thick inhomogeneities (""CLUMPY"" models) yielding
somewhat better agreement than those with optically thin inhomogeneities (""FF""
models). We show how variations in the ionization parameter U, derived from
emission line ratios, could be due to photon escape. Using a rather wide range
of assumptions about the filling factor of dense clumps we find, for a selected
set of regions observed in M51 photon escape fraction ranging between 30% and
50%. We show, using oxygen as the test element, that models with different
assumptions about the gas inhomogeneity will give variations in the abundance
values derived from diagnostic diagrams, but do not claim here to have a fully
developed set of diagnostic tools to improve abundance determinations made in
this way. We finally propose a combination of line ratios with the absolute
Halpha luminosity of a given HII region, which allows us to determine the
photon escape fraction, and hence resolve the degeneracy between U and xi.",2005-04-11T09:46:30Z
A Radio Transient 0.1 pc from Sagittarius A*,"We report the discovery of a transient radio source 2.7 arcsec (0.1 pc
projected distance) South of the Galactic Center massive black hole,
Sagittarius A*. The source flared with a peak of at least 80 mJy in March 2004.
The source was resolved by the Very Large Array into two components with a
separation of ~0.7 arcsec and characteristic sizes of ~0.2 arcsec. The two
components of the source faded with a power-law index of 1.1 +/- 0.1. We detect
an upper limit to the proper motion of the Eastern component of ~3 x 10^3 km
s^-1 relative to Sgr A*. We detect a proper motion of ~10^4 km s^-1 for the
Western component relative to Sgr A*. The transient was also detected at X-ray
wavelengths with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton telescope and
given the designation CXOGC J174540.0-290031. The X-ray source falls in between
the two radio components. The maximum luminosity of the X-ray source is ~10^36
erg s^-1, significantly sub-Eddington. The radio jet flux density predicted by
the X-ray/radio correlation for X-ray binaries is orders of magnitude less than
the measured flux density. We conclude that the radio transient is the result
of a bipolar jet originating in a single impulsive event from the X-ray source
and interacting with the dense interstellar medium of the Galactic Center.",2005-07-08T20:36:44Z
"Bright OB stars in the Galaxy.II. Wind variability in O supergiants as
  traced by H-alpha","We investigate the line-profile variability (lpv) of H-alpha for a large
sample of O-type supergiants. We used the Temporal Variance Spectrum (TVS)
analysis, developed by Fullerton et al 1996 and modified by us to take into
account the effects of wind emission. By means of a comparative analysis we put
a number of constraints on the properties of the variability as a function of
stellar and wind parameters. The results of our analysis show that all the
stars in the sample show evidence of significant lpv in H-alpha, mostly
dominated by processes in the wind. The variations occur between zero and 0.3
v_inf (i.e., below ~1.5 R_star), in good agreement with the results from
similar studies. A comparison between observations and line-profile simulations
indicates that for stars with intermediate wind densities the H-alpha
variability can be explained by simple models, consisting of coherent or broken
shells (blobs) uniformly distributed over the wind volume, with an intrinsic
scatter in the maximum density contrast of about a factor of two. For stars at
lower and higher wind densities, on the other hand, we found certain
inconsistencies between observations and our predictions, most importantly
concerning the mean amplitude and the symmetry properties of the TVS. This
disagreement might be explained with the presence of coherent large-scale
structures, partly confined in a volume close to the star. Interpreted in terms
of a variable mass-loss rate, the observed variations of H-alpha indicate
changes of 4% with respect to the mean value of M_dot for stars with stronger
winds and of 16% for stars with weaker winds. The effect of these variations on
the corresponding wind momenta is rather insignificant (<0.16 dex), increasing
the local scatter without affecting the Wind Momentum Luminosity Relationship.",2005-05-31T09:03:58Z
"The trail of discrete X-ray sources in the early-type galaxy NGC4261:
  anisotropy in the globular cluster distribution?","Chandra images of the elliptical galaxy NGC4261 have revealed an anisotropy
in the spatial distribution of the off-nuclear X-ray sources, interpreted by
Zezas et al. as evidence of an association with a young stellar population. Our
independent analysis of archive X-ray (Chandra) and optical (INT and HST)
observations confirms the anisotropy of the X-ray sources but conducts to a
different interpretation for their origin. We find that nearly half of the
X-ray sources are associated to a globular cluster (optical counterpart)
suggesting that they are accreting low-mass X-ray binaries. Where color index
information is available, the X-ray sources are found to reside in red
(metal-rich) systems. The luminosity function of the X-ray sources is also
consistent with the one drawn from a population of Low Mass X-ray Binaries. We
further investigate the properties of the sample of point-like sources obtained
from archival optical images that we suggest are good globular cluster
candidates and for which we find that the projected spatial distribution is
non-homogeneous. In addition, we show that the distributions of the optical and
X-ray populations are very similar, which leads us to conclude that the spatial
anisotropy of the X-ray sources in NGC4261 is mostly a reflection of the
anisotropy of the globular cluster population.",2005-08-08T13:31:18Z
"Exploring Halo Substructure with Giant Stars VIII: The Extended
  Structure of the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy","(Abridged) We explore the spatial distribution of stars in the Sculptor dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxy over an area of 7.82 deg^2. We identify red giant
branch (RGB) starts via Washington M, T_2+DDO51 photometry and a blue
horizontal branch (BHB) population to map the spatial structure of the dSph. A
spectroscopically observed subset of Sculptor candidate stars yield a systemic
heliocentric velocity for the system of v_{hel}=110.43 km/s, in good agreement
with previous studies, and a global velocity dispersion of sigma_v=8.8 km/s,
which may rise slightly past 0.4r_{lim}. To a limit of M~19, we find 94% of the
photometrically-selected Sculptor giant star candidates with spectrocopic
measurements are kinematically associated with Sculptor, and four of ten stars
not selected photometrically are selected kinematically; our candidate samples
are likely to be very pure. We take considerable care in assessing the
contaminating background level in our photometric sample to ensure accurate
density profiles. These assessments verify that we detect a considerable
stellar density of Sculptor stars to the limits of our survey area in both the
RGB and BHB samples. We find the Sculptor density profile is well-fit by a King
profile of limiting radius r_{lim} = 79.6 within ~60 arcmin, beyond which a
""break"" to a power law profile occurs. This break population must be either a
bound group of ""halo stars"" around the Sculptor dSph or unbound tidal debris.
The latter is supported by 2D distribution analyses and, if true, implies a
fractional mass-loss rate of ~0.042 Gyr^{-1} for Sculptor. Finally, likely more
metal-poor RGB stars (as selected by color and magnitude) are significantly
less centrally concentrated and, therefore, constitute the primary contributor
to the likely tidally-stripped parts of the dSph.",2005-08-02T22:19:38Z
Finding outlier light-curves in catalogs of periodic variable stars,"We present a methodology to discover outliers in catalogs of periodic
light-curves. We use cross-correlation as measure of ``similarity'' between two
individual light-curves and then classify light-curves with lowest average
``similarity'' as outliers. We performed the analysis on catalogs of variable
stars of known type from the MACHO and OGLE projects and established that our
method correctly identifies light-curves that do not belong to those catalogs
as outliers. We show how our method can scale to large datasets that will be
available in the near future such as those anticipated from Pan-STARRS and
LSST.",2005-05-24T20:06:42Z
Molecular Hydrogen Emission from Protoplanetary Disks,"We have modeled self-consistently the density and temperature profiles of gas
and dust in protoplanetary disks, taking into account irradiation from a
central star. Making use of this physical structure, we have calculated the
level populations of molecular hydrogen and the line emission from the disks.
As a result, we can reproduce the observed strong line spectra of molecular
hydrogen from protoplanetary disks, both in the ultraviolet (UV) and the
near-infrared, but only if the central star has a strong UV excess radiation.",2005-05-06T13:06:36Z
XMM-Newton and VLT observations of the afterglow of GRB040827,"The field of the Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 040827 was observed with XMM-Newton and
with the ESO/VLT starting ~6 and ~12 hours after the burst, respectively. A
fading X-ray afterglow is clearly detected with the XMM-Newton/EPIC instrument,
with a time decay t^(-delta), with delta=1.41+/-0.10. Its spectrum is well
described by a power law (photon index Gamma=2.3+/-0.1) affected by an
absorption largely exceeding (by a factor ~5) the expected Galactic one,
requiring the contribution of an intrinsic, redshifted absorber. In the
optical/NIR range, the afterglow emission was observed in the Ks band, as a
weak source superimposed to the host galaxy, with magnitude Ks=19.44+/-0.13 (12
hours after the GRB, contribution from the host subtracted); in other bands the
flux is dominated by the host galaxy. Coupling constraints derived from X-ray
spectral fitting and from photometry of the host, we estimated a gas column
density in the range (0.4-2.6)x10^22 cm^-2 in the GRB host galaxy, likely
located at a redshift 0.5<z<1.7. GRB 040827 stands out as the best example of
an X-ray afterglow with intrinsic absorption.",2005-05-12T15:54:13Z
Rapid Dissipation of Primordial Gas from the AU Microscopii Debris Disk,"The disk around AU Microscopii, an M1 star in the Beta Pictoris Moving Group,
is extraordinarily well-suited for comparison to the Beta Pic debris disk (type
A5V). We use far-UV absorption spectroscopy of AU Mic to probe its edge-on disk
for small amounts of molecular hydrogen, the primary constituent of gas giant
planets. Our conservative upper limit on the line-of-sight H_2 column density
is 1.7 x 10^{19} cm^{-2}, which is 18.5 times lower than the limit obtained
from non-detection of sub-mm CO emission (Liu et al. 2004). In addition, there
is a hint of H_2 absorption at a column density an order of magnitude or more
below our upper limit. The H_2-to-dust ratio in the AU Mic disk is < 6:1,
similar to that in the Beta Pic disk. This shows that the primordial gas has
largely been dissipated in less than about 12 Myr for both disks, despite their
very different stellar masses and luminosities. It is extremely difficult to
form a giant planet around AU Mic with current core-accretion scenarios in such
a short time.",2005-05-13T21:40:43Z
"Evaluating Gaia performances on eclipsing binaries. IV. Orbits and
  stellar parameters for SV Cam, BS Dra and HP Dra","This is the fourth in a series of papers that aim both to provide reasonable
orbits for a number of eclipsing binaries and to evaluate the expected
performance of Gaia of these objects and the accuracy that is achievable in the
determination of such fundamental stellar parameters as mass and radius. In
this paper, we attempt to derive the orbits and physical parameters for three
eclipsing binaries in the mid-F to mid-G spectral range. As for previous
papers, only the Hp, Vt, Bt photometry from the Hipparcos/Tycho mission and
ground-based radial velocities from spectroscopy in the region 8480-8740 A are
used in the analyses. These data sets simulate the photometric and
spectroscopic data that are expected to be obtained by Gaia, the approved ESA
Cornerstone mission to be launched in 2011. The systems targeted in this paper
are SV Cam, BS Dra and HP Dra. SV Cam and BS Dra have been studied previously,
allowing comparisons of the derived parameters with those from full scale and
devoted ground-based investigations. HP Dra has no published orbital solution.
SV Cam has a beta Lyrae type light curve and the others have Algol-like light
curves. SV Cam has the complication of light curve anomalies, usually
attributed to spots; BS Dra has non-solar metallicity, and HP Dra appears to
have a small eccentricity and a sizeable time derivative in the argument of the
periastron. Thus all three provide interesting and different test cases.",2005-06-06T10:07:02Z
"Halpha-Derived Star-Formation Rates For Three z ~ 0.75 EDisCS Galaxy
  Clusters","We present Halpha-derived star-formation rates (SFRs) for three z ~ 0.75
galaxy clusters. Our 1 sigma flux limit corresponds to a star-formation rate of
0.10-0.24 solar mass per year, and our minimum reliable Halpha + [N II]
rest-frame equivalent width is 10\AA. We show that Halpha narrowband imaging is
an efficient method for measuring star formation in distant clusters. In two
out of three clusters, we find that the fraction of star-forming galaxies
increases with projected distance from the cluster center. We also find that
the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with increasing local galaxy
surface density in the same two clusters. We compare the median rate of star
formation among star-forming cluster galaxies to a small sample of star-forming
field galaxies from the literature and find that the median cluster SFRs are
\~50% less than the median field SFR. We characterize cluster evolution in
terms of the mass-normalized integrated cluster SFR and find that the z ~ 0.75
clusters have more SFR per cluster mass on average than the z <= 0.4 clusters
from the literature. The interpretation of this result is complicated by the
dependence of the mass-normalized SFR on cluster mass and the lack of
sufficient overlap in the mass ranges covered by the low and high redshift
samples. We find that the fraction and luminosities of the brightest starburst
galaxies at z ~ 0.75 are consistent with their being progenitors of the
post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0.45 if the post-starburst phase lasts several
(~5) times longer than the starburst phase.",2005-04-26T18:26:56Z
"The intermediate-age open clusters Ruprecht 61, Czernik 32, NGC 2225 and
  NGC 2262","We present the first $BVI$ CCD photometry to $V=22.0$ of 4 fields centered on
the region of the southern Galactic star clusters Ruprecht~61, Czernik~32, NGC
2225 and NGC 2262 and of 4 displaced control fields. These clusters were never
studied before, and we provide for the first time estimates of their
fundamental parameters, namely radial extent, age, distance and reddening. We
find that the four clusters are all of intermediate age (around 1 Gyr), close
to the Sun and possess lower than solar metal abundance.",2005-06-24T13:52:46Z
Near and Mid Infrared Observations of Ultracompact HII Regions,"This review discussed near- and mid- infrared observations of ultracompact
(UC) HII regions. The importance of ISO mid-IR fine-structure nebular lines is
emphasised since only a small fraction of UCHII regions are observed directly
in the near-IR. The reliability of contemporary atmospheric models for such
indirect diagnostics is discussed, whilst a revised Spectral Type-Temperature
calibration is presented for Galactic O3 to B3 dwarfs. In particular,
fine-structure line derived properties of G29.96-0.02 differ from the direct
near-IR spectroscopic result and represents a serious discrepancy which needs
to be addressed. Mid-IR MSX and Spitzer imaging permits the identification of
those UCHII regions for which far-IR IRAS fluxes are reliable, relevant to the
single versus cluster nature of individual sources. High spatial resolution
imaging with ground-based 8m telescopes allows more direct tests, as recently
applied to G70.29+1.60. Finally, recent Spitzer mid-IR observations of Giant
HII regions are briefly discussed.",2005-06-14T20:24:51Z
"Hydrodynamical simulations of the decay of high-speed molecular
  turbulence. II. Divergence from isothermality","A roughly constant temperature over a wide range of densities is maintained
in molecular clouds through radiative heating and cooling. An isothermal
equation of state is therefore frequently employed in molecular cloud
simulations. However, the dynamical processes in molecular clouds include shock
waves, expansion waves, cooling induced collapse and baroclinic vorticity, all
incompatible with the assumption of a purely isothermal flow. Here, we
incorporate an energy equation including all the important heating and cooling
rates and a simple chemical network into simulations of three-dimensional,
hydrodynamic, decaying turbulence. This allows us to test the accuracy of the
isothermal assumption by directly comparing a model run with the modified
energy equation to an isothermal model. We compute an extreme case in which the
initial turbulence is sufficiently strong to dissociate much of the gas and
alter the specific heat ratio. The molecules then reform as the turbulence
weakens. We track the true specific heat ratio as well as its effective value.
We analyse power spectra, vorticity and shock structures, and discuss scaling
laws for decaying turbulence. We derive some limitations to the isothermal
approximation for simulations of the interstellar medium using simple
projection techniques. Overall, even given the extreme conditions, we find that
an isothermal flow provides an adequate physical and observational description
of many properties. The main exceptions revealed here concern behaviour
directly related to the high temperature zones behind the shock waves.",2005-04-22T16:36:33Z
Spitzer view on the evolution of star-forming galaxies from z=0 to z~3,"We use a 24 micron selected sample containing more than 8,000 sources to
study the evolution of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range from z=0 to
z~3. We obtain photometric redshifts for most of the sources in our survey
using a method based on empirically-built templates spanning from ultraviolet
to mid-infrared wavelengths. The accuracy of these redshifts is better than 10%
for 80% of the sample. The derived redshift distribution of the sources
detected by our survey peaks at around z=0.6-1.0 (the location of the peak
being affected by cosmic variance), and decays monotonically from z~1 to z~3.
We have fitted infrared luminosity functions in several redshift bins in the
range 0<z<~3. Our results constrain the density and/or luminosity evolution of
infrared-bright star-forming galaxies. The typical infrared luminosity (L*)
decreases by an order of magnitude from z~2 to the present. The cosmic star
formation rate (SFR) density goes as (1+z)^{4.0\pm0.2} from z=0 to z=0.8. From
z=0.8 to z~1.2, the SFR density continues rising with a smaller slope. At
1.2<z<3, the cosmic SFR density remains roughly constant. The SFR density is
dominated at low redshift (z<0.5) by galaxies which are not very luminous in
the infrared (L_TIR<1.e11 L_sun, where L_TIR is the total infrared luminosity,
integrated from 8 to 1000 micron). The contribution from luminous and
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (L_TIR>1.e11 L_sun) to the total SFR density
increases steadily from z~0 up to z~2.5, forming at least half of the
newly-born stars by z~1.5. Ultraluminous infrared galaxies (L_TIR>1.e12 L_sun)
play a rapidly increasing role for z>~1.3.",2005-05-05T15:20:03Z
The [Fe IV] Discrepancy: Constraining the Iron Abundances in Nebulae,"We study the current discrepancy between the model-predicted and measured
concentrations of Fe++ and Fe3+ in ionized nebulae. We calculate a set of
photoionization models, updated with the atomic data relevant to the problem,
and compare their results with those derived for the available nebulae where
both [Fe III] and [Fe IV] lines have been measured. Our new model results are
closer to the measured values than the results of previous calculations, but a
discrepancy remains. This discrepancy translates into an uncertainty in the
derived Fe abundances of a factor up to ~4. We explore the possible causes of
this discrepancy and find that errors in the Fe atomic data may be the most
likely explanation. The discrepancy can be fully accounted for by any of the
following changes: (1) an increase by a factor of ~10 in the recombination rate
(radiative plus dielectronic, or charge transfer) for Fe3+, (2) an increase by
a factor of 2-3 in the effective collision strengths for Fe++, or (3) a
decrease by a factor of 2-3 in the effective collision strengths for Fe3+. We
derive the Fe abundances implied by these three explanations and use the
results to constrain the degree of depletion of Fe in our sample nebulae. The
Galactic H II regions and planetary nebulae are found to have high depletion
factors, with less than 5% of their Fe atoms in the gas phase. The
extragalactic H II regions (LMC 30 Doradus, SMC N88A, and SBS 0335-052) have
somewhat lower depletions. The metal-deficient blue compact galaxy SBS 0335-052
could have from 13% to 40% of Fe in the gas phase. The depletions derived for
the different objects define a trend of increasing depletion at higher
metallicities.",2005-04-05T23:10:44Z
Measurement of core-shifts with astrometric multi-frequency calibration,"VLBI is unique, among the space geodetic techniques, in its contribution to
defining and maintaining the International Celestial Reference Frame, providing
precise measurements of coordinates of extragalactic radiosources. The quest
for increasing accuracy of VLBI geodetic products has lead to a deeper revision
of all aspects that might introduce errors in the analysis. The departure of
the observed sources from perfect, stable, compact and achromatic celestial
targets falls within this category. This paper is concerned with the impact of
unaccounted frequency-dependent position shifts of source cores in the analysis
of dual-band S/X VLBI geodesy observations, and proposes a new method to
measure them. The multi-frequency phase transfer technique developed and
demonstrated by Middelberg et al. (2005) increases the high frequency coherence
times of VLBI observations, using the observations at a lower frequency. Our
proposed SOURCE/FREQUENCY PHASE REFERENCING method endows it with astrometric
applications by adding a strategy to estimate the ionospheric contributions.
Here we report on the first successful application to measure the core shift of
the quasar 1038+528 A at S and X-bands, and validate the results by comparison
with those from standard phase referencing techniques. In this particular case,
and in general in the cm-wavelength regime, both methods are equivalent.
Moreover the proposed method opens a new horizon with targets and fields
suitable for high precision astrometric studies with VLBI, especially at high
frequencies where severe limitations imposed by the rapid fluctuations in the
troposphere prevent the use of standard phase referencing techniques.",2005-05-23T14:07:29Z
"The dynamics and high-energy emission of conductive gas clouds in
  supernova-driven galactic superwinds","In this paper we present high-resolution hydrodynamical models of warm
ionized clouds embedded in a superwind, and compare the OVI and soft X-ray
properties to the existing observational data. These models include thermal
conduction, which we show plays an important role in shaping both the dynamics
and radiative properties of the resulting wind/cloud interaction. Heat
conduction stabilizes the cloud by inhibiting the growth of K-H and R-T
instabilities, and also generates a shock wave at the cloud's surface that
compresses the cloud. This dynamical behaviour influences the observable
properties. We find that while OVI emission and absorption always arises in
cloud material at the periphery of the cloud, most of the soft X-ray arises in
the region between the wind bow shock and the cloud surface, and probes either
wind or cloud material depending on the strength of conduction and the relative
abundances of the wind with respect to the cloud. In general only a small
fraction (<1%) of the wind mechanical energy intersecting a cloud is radiated
away at UV and X-ray wavelengths, with more wind energy going into accelerating
the cloud. Models with heat conduction at Spitzer-levels are found to produce
observational properties closer to those observed in superwinds than models
with no thermal conduction, in particular in terms of the OVI-to-X-ray
luminosity ratio, but cloud life times are uncomfortably short (<1Myr) compared
to the dynamical ages of real winds. We experimented with reducing the thermal
conductivity and found that even when we reduced conduction by a factor of 25
that the simulations retained the beneficial hydrodynamical stability and low
O{\sc vi}-to-X-ray luminosity ratio found in the Spitzer-level conductive
models, while also having reduced evaporation rates.",2005-06-27T14:12:33Z
Circumstellar Dust Disks in Taurus-Auriga: The Submillimeter Perspective,"We present a sensitive, multiwavelength submillimeter continuum survey of 153
young stellar objects in the Taurus-Auriga star formation region. The
submillimeter detection rate is 61% to a completeness limit of ~10 mJy
(3-sigma) at 850 microns. The inferred circumstellar disk masses are
log-normally distributed with a mean mass of ~0.005 solar masses and a large
dispersion (0.5 dex). Roughly one third of the submillimeter sources have disk
masses larger than the minimal nebula from which the solar system formed. The
median disk to star mass ratio is 0.5%. The empirical behavior of the
submillimeter continuum is best described as F_nu ~ nu^(2.0 +/- 0.5) between
350 microns and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of the
fraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of the
opacity compared to the ISM. This latter effect could be due to a substantial
population of large dust grains, which presumably would have grown through
collisional agglomeration. In this sample, the only stellar property that is
correlated with the outer disk is the presence of a companion. We find evidence
for significant decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, and
submillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral energy
distribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. The fraction of
objects detected in the submillimeter is essentially identical to the fraction
with excess near-infrared emission, suggesting that dust in the inner and outer
disk are removed nearly simultaneously.",2005-06-08T22:53:56Z
"The H II Region/PDR Connection: Self-Consistent Calculations of Physical
  Conditions in Star-Forming Regions","We have performed a series of calculations designed to reproduce infrared
diagnostics used to determine physical conditions in star forming regions. We
self-consistently calculate the thermal and chemical structure of an H II
region and photodissociation region (PDR) that are in pressure equilibrium.
This differs from previous work, which used separate calculations for each gas
phase. Our calculations span a wide range of stellar temperatures, gas
densities, and ionization parameters. We describe improvements made to the
spectral synthesis code Cloudy that made these calculations possible. These
include the addition of a molecular network with ~1000 reactions involving 68
molecular species and improved treatment of the grain physics. Data from the
Spitzer First Look Survey, along with other archives, are used to derive
important physical characteristics of the H II region and PDR. These include
stellar temperatures, electron densities, ionization parameters, UV radiation
flux, and PDR density. Finally, we calculate the contribution of the H II
region to PDR emission line diagnostics, which allows for a more accurate
determination of physical conditions in the PDR.",2005-06-21T21:52:53Z
The Galaxy in the cosmological context,"A new view on our Galaxy has recently emerged, with large consequences on its
formation scenarios. Not only new dwarf satellites have been detected, still
orbiting and tidally disrupting, but also a multitude of stellar streams or
tidal debris have been observed suggesting the formation of the halo through
successive accretions. The large scatter in the age-metallicity relation in the
solar neighborhood points towards several accretion episodes, while the
chemical evolution of the disk requires a more or less continuous gas infall.
The global kinematics and morphology refined by large surveys such as 2MASS
suggest the existence of two embedded bars, as is frequently observed in
external galaxies. The mass of the central black hole has been refined through
stellar proper motions, and is compatible with the M$_{bh}$-$\sigma$ relation
valid for all bulges. The baryonic dark matter is no longer thought to lie in
compact objects, and on the contrary, more dark cold gas is revealed by
gamma-ray observations. The star forming history can be built, and confronted
to numerical models of galaxy evolution both through hierarchical and secular
scenarios. Our Galaxy plays thus the role of a prototype to probe galaxy
formation theories, and in particular thin and thick disk formation.",2005-07-12T11:11:17Z
"A Catalogue of Field Horizontal Branch Stars Aligned with High Velocity
  Clouds","We present a catalogue of 430 Field Horizontal Branch (FHB) stars, selected
from the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), which fortuitously align with high column
density neutral hydrogen (HI) High-Velocity Cloud (HVC) gas. These stars are
ideal candidates for absorption-line studies of HVCs, attempts at which have
been made for almost 40 years with little success. A parent sample of 8321 HES
FHB stars was used to extract HI spectra along each line-of-sight, using the HI
Parkes All-Sky Survey. All lines-of-sight aligned with high velocity HI
emission with peak brightness temperatures greater than 120mK were examined.
The HI spectra of these 430 probes were visually screened and cross-referenced
with several HVC catalogues. In a forthcoming paper, we report on the results
of high-resolution spectroscopic observations of a sample of stars drawn from
this catalogue.",2005-06-27T09:36:40Z
"Dense Cloud Ablation and Ram Pressure Stripping of the Virgo Spiral NGC
  4402","We present optical, HI and radio continuum observations of the highly
inclined Virgo Cluster Sc galaxy NGC 4402, which show evidence for ram-pressure
stripping and dense cloud ablation. VLA HI and radio continuum maps show a
truncated gas disk and emission to the northwest of the main disk emission. In
particular, the radio continuum emission is asymmetrically extended to the
north and skewed to the west. The Halpha image shows numerous HII complexes
along the southern edge of the gas disk, possibly indicating star formation
triggered by the ICM pressure. BVR images at 0.5"" resolution obtained with the
WIYN Tip-Tilt Imager show a remarkable dust lane morphology: at half the
optical radius, the dust lane of the galaxy curves up and out of the disk,
matching the HI morphology. Large dust plumes extend upward for ~1.5 kpc from
luminous young star clusters at the SE edge of the truncated gas disk. These
star clusters are very blue, indicating very little dust reddening, which
suggests dust blown away by an ICM wind at the leading edge of the interaction.
To the south of the main ridge of interstellar material, where the galaxy is
relatively clean of gas and dust, we have discovered 1 kpc long linear dust
filaments with a position angle that matches the extraplanar radio continuum
tail; we interpret this angle as the projected ICM wind direction. One of the
observed dust filaments has an HII region at its head. We interpret these dust
filaments as large, dense clouds which were initially left behind as the
low-density ISM is stripped, but are then ablated by the ICM wind. These
results provide striking new evidence on the fate of molecular clouds in
stripped cluster galaxies.",2005-03-18T21:11:54Z
XMM-Newton spectral properties of the Ultraluminous IRAS Galaxy Mrk 273,"We present a 23 ks XMM-Newton observation of the ULIRG Mrk 273. The hard
X-ray spectrum can be modeled by a highly absorbed power law plus an Fe Kalpha
emission line. The iron line is broad, suggesting possible superposition of a
neutral iron line at 6.4 keV, and a blend of ionized iron lines from Fe XXV and
Fe XXVI. Given the relatively short exposure, the three line components can not
be singularly resolved with high statistical significance: the neutral
component is detected at ~2.5sigma and the Fe XXV line at ~2sigma c.l., while
for the Fe XXVI line we can only estimate an upper limit. The broad band
spectrum requires, in addition to a highly absorbed power law, at least three
collisionally ionized plasma components, which may be associated with
star-forming regions. The temperatures of the three plasmas are about 0.3, 0.8
and 6 keV, where the highest of the three is sufficient to produce ionized iron
emission lines. An alternative interpretation for the origin of the soft
emission might also be given in terms of reflection off some photoionized gas,
as has been observed in a number of nearby Compton-thick Seyfert 2 galaxies. A
hot gas, photoionized by the primary, continuum can also produce ionized iron
lines. Unfortunately, given the limited statistics and the lack of high
resolution spectroscopy, it is not possible to distinguish between the two
models investigated. We further compare the XMM-Newton findings with the
Chandra data obtaining consistent spectral results. The absorption corrected
hard X-ray (2-10 keV) luminosity of Mrk 273 corresponds to ~0.2% of the far-IR
luminosity, similar to typical values found in pure starbursts. The thermal
contribution to the soft X-ray luminosity is ~0.2-0.7x10^42 erg s^-1,
comparable to those found in NGC 6240 and other starburst dominated ULIRGs.",2005-07-13T14:19:21Z
Gravitational Microlensing and the Structure of Quasar Outflows,"We show that invaluable information on the structure of quasar outflows can
be obtained by considering microlensing (ML) induced variability of absorption
line troughs in lensed quasars. Depending on the structure and geometry of the
outflowing gas, such extrinsic line variability can be manifested as changes to
the equivalent width of the line as well as line profile distortions. Here we
consider several physically distinct outflow models, having very similar
spectral predictions, and show how ML induced absorption line variability can
be used to distinguish between them. The merits of future systematic studies of
these effects are exemplified.",2005-04-12T05:24:08Z
"Post-glitch variability in the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1RXS
  J170849.0-400910","We report on the first XMM-Newton observation of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar
1RXS J170849.0-400910. The source was observed in 2003 August and was found at
a flux level a factor of about two lower than previous observations. Moreover,
a significant spectral evolution appears to be present, the source exhibiting a
much softer spectrum than in the past. Comparison of the present properties of
1RXS J170849.0-400910 with those from archival data shows a clear correlation
between the X-ray flux and the spectral hardness. In particular, the flux and
the spectral hardness reached a maximum level close to the two glitches the
source experienced in 1999 and in 2001, and successively decreased. Although
the excellent XMM-Newton spectral resolution should in principle allow us to
detect the absorption line reported in a phase-resolved spectrum with BeppoSAX
and interpreted as a cyclotron feature, we found no absorption features,
neither in the phase averaged spectrum nor in the phase resolved spectra. We
discuss in detail both the possibilities that the feature in the BeppoSAX data
may have resulted from a spurious detection or that it is real and
intrinsically variable. We then discuss a possible explanation for the glitches
and for the softening of the source emission which followed the flux decrease,
in the framework of the magnetar model.",2005-05-19T12:06:37Z
"Enhanced X-ray variability from V1647 Ori, the young star in outburst
  illuminating McNeil's Nebula","We report a ~38 ks X-ray observation of McNeil's Nebula obtained with XMM on
2004 April 4. V1647 Ori, the young star in outburst illuminating McNeil's
Nebula, is detected with XMM and appears variable in X-rays. We investigate the
hardness ratio variability and time variations of the event energy distribution
with quantile analysis, and show that the large increase of the count rate from
V1647 Ori observed during the second half of the observation is not associated
with any large plasma temperature variations as for typical X-ray flares from
young low-mass stars. X-ray spectral fitting shows that the bulk (~75%) of the
intrinsic X-ray emission in the 0.5-8 keV energy band comes from a soft plasma
component (0.9 keV) reminiscent of the X-ray spectrum of the classical T Tauri
star TW Hya, for which X-ray emission is believed to be generated by an
accretion shock onto the photosphere of a low-mass star. The hard plasma
component (4.2 keV) contributes ~25% of the total X-ray emission, and can be
understood only in the framework of plasma heating sustained by magnetic
reconnection events. We find a hydrogen column density of NH=4.1E22 cm-2, which
points out a significant excess of hydrogen column density compared to the
value derived from optical/IR observations, consistent with the picture of the
rise of a wind/jet unveiled from ground optical spectroscopy. The X-ray flux
observed with XMM ranges from roughly the flux observed by Chandra on 2004
March 22 (~10 times greater than the pre-outburst X-ray flux) to a value two
times greater than that caught by Chandra on 2004 March 7 (~200 times greater
than the pre-outburst X-ray flux). We have investigated the possibility that
V1647 Ori displays a periodic variation in X-ray brightness as suggested by the
combined Chandra+XMM data set (abridged).",2005-04-05T15:18:42Z
"Search for Extra-Terrestrial planets: The DARWIN mission - Target Stars
  and Array Architectures","The DARWIN mission is an Infrared free flying interferometer mission based on
the new technique of nulling interferometry. Its main objective is to detect
and characterize other Earth-like planets, analyze the composition of their
atmospheres and their capability to sustain life, as we know it. DARWIN is
currently in definition phase. This PhD work that has been undertaken within
the DARWIN team at the European Space Agency (ESA) addresses two crucial
aspects of the mission. Firstly, a DARWIN target star list has been established
that includes characteristics of the target star sample that will be critical
for final mission design, such as, luminosity, distance, spectral
classification, stellar variability, multiplicity, location and radius of the
star. Constrains were applied as set by planet evolution theory and mission
architecture. Secondly, a number of alternative mission architectures have been
evaluated on the basis of interferometer response as a function of wavelength,
achievable modulation efficiency, number of telescopes and starlight rejection
capabilities. The study has shown that the core mission goals should be
achievable with a lower level of complexity as compared to the current baseline
configuration.",2005-04-22T12:39:07Z
"Low-Energy Hadron Production Data and Current Status of CERN
  Measurements","Data on low-energy hadron production in collisions of nucleons, pions and
kaons with light nuclei are needed for many astrophysical and accelerator
applications. Modern simulations have reached a level of accuracy that the lack
of detailed understanding of hadron production processes has become one of the
most important limitations to further improvements. After giving some examples
of hadroproduction processes in astrophysics and neutrino experiments we
briefly review existing fixed-target data on light nuclei. Preliminary results
and prospects of current CERN measurements (HARP, NA49) are discussed.",2005-04-15T18:07:41Z
Observation of small scale structure using sextupole lensing,"Weak gravitational lensing seeks to determine shear by measuring induced
quadrupole (elliptical) shapes in background galaxy images. Small impact
parameter (a few kpc) gravitational lensing by foreground core masses between 2
10^{9} and 2 10^{12} M_\odot will additionally induce a sextupole shape with
the quadrupole and sextupole minima aligned. This correlation in relative
orientation of the quadrupole and sextupole provides a sensitive method to
identify images which have been slightly curved by lensing events. A general
theoretical framework for sextupole lensing is developed which includes several
low order coefficients in a general lensing map. Tools to impute map
coefficients from the galaxy images are described and applied to the north
Hubble deep field. Instrumental PSFs, camera charge diffusion, and image
composition methods are modelled in the coefficient determination process.
Estimates of Poisson counting noise for each galaxy are used to cut galaxies
with signals too small to reliably establish curvature. Curved galaxies are
found to be spatially clumped, as would be expected if the curving were due to
small impact parameter lensing by localized ensembles of dark matter haloes.
Simulations provide an estimate of the total required lensing mass and the
acceptable mass range of the constituent haloes. The overdensities and
underdensities of visible galaxies and their locations in the Hubble foreground
is found to be consistent with our observations and their interpretation as
lensing events.",2005-04-08T19:51:11Z
Evolution of X-ray emission from young massive star clusters,"The evolution of X-ray emission from young massive star clusters is modeled,
taking into account the emission from the stars as well as from the cluster
wind. It is shown that the level and character of the soft (0.2-10 keV) X-ray
emission change drastically with cluster age and are tightly linked with
stellar evolution. Using the modern X-ray observations of massive stars we show
that the correlation between bolometric and X-ray luminosity known for single O
stars also holds for O+O and O+Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries. The diffuse emission
originates from the cluster wind heated by the kinetic energy of stellar winds
and supernova explosions. To model the evolution of the cluster wind, the mass
and energy yields from a population synthesis are used as input to a
hydrodynamic model. It is shown that in a very young clusters the emission from
the cluster wind is low. When the cluster evolves, WR stars are formed. Their
strong stellar winds power an increasing X-ray emission of the cluster wind.
Subsequent supernova explosions pump the level of diffuse emission even higher.
Clusters at this evolutionary stage may have no X-ray bright stellar point
sources, but a relatively high level of diffuse emission. A supernova remnant
may become a dominant X-ray source, but only for a short time interval of a few
thousand years. We retrieve and analyse Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of
six massive star clusters located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our model
reproduces the observed diffuse and point-source emission from these LMC
clusters, as well as from the Galactic clusters Arches, Quintuplet and NGC
3603.",2005-05-25T14:20:56Z
The Warped Circumstellar Disk of HD100546,"We propose that the two armed spiral features seen in visible Hubble Space
Telescope images of scattered light in HD100546's circumstellar disk are caused
by the illumination of a warped outer disk. A tilt of 6-15 degrees from the
symmetry plane can cause the observed surface brightness variations providing
the disk is very twisted (highly warped) at radii greater than 200 AU where the
spiral features are seen. Dust lanes are due in part to shadowing in the
equatorial plane from the inner disk within a radius of 100 AU. HD100546's
outer disk, if viewed edge-on, would appear similar to that of Beta Pictorus. A
disk initially misaligned with a planetary system, becomes warped due to
precession induced by planetesimal bodies and planets. However, the twistedness
of HD100546's disk cannot be explained by precession during the lifetime of the
system induced by a single Jovian mass planet within the clearing at ~13 AU.
One possible explanation for the corrugated disk is that precession was induced
by massive of bodies embedded in the disk at larger radius. This would require
approximately a Jupiter mass of bodies well outside the central clearing at 13
AU and within the location of the spiral features or at radii approximately
between 50-200 AU.",2005-05-05T05:10:13Z
The FIRST-Optical-VLA Survey for Lensed Radio Lobes,"We present results from a survey for gravitationally lensed radio lobes.
Lensed lobes are a potentially richer source of information about galaxy mass
distributions than lensed point sources, which have been the exclusive focus of
other recent surveys. Our approach is to identify radio lobes in the FIRST
catalog and then search optical catalogs for coincident foreground galaxies,
which are candidate lensing galaxies. We then obtain higher-resolution images
of these targets at both optical and radio wavelengths, and obtain optical
spectra for the most promising candidates. We present maps of several radio
lobes that are nearly coincident with galaxies. We have not found any new and
unambiguous cases of gravitational lensing. One radio lobe in particular, FOV
J0743+1553, has two hot spots that could be multiple images produced by a
z=0.19 spiral galaxy, but the lensing interpretation is problematic.",2005-07-12T19:09:06Z
Lyman Alpha Flux Power Spectrum and Its Covariance,"We analyze the flux power spectrum and its covariance using simulated Lyman
alpha forests. We find that pseudo-hydro techniques are good approximations of
hydrodynamical simulations at high redshift. However, the pseudo-hydro
techniques fail at low redshift because they are insufficient for
characterizing some components of the low-redshift intergalactic medium,
notably the warm-hot intergalactic medium. Hence, to use the low-redshift Lyman
alpha flux power spectrum to constrain cosmology, one would need realistic
hydrodynamical simulations. By comparing one-dimensional mass statistics with
flux statistics, we show that the nonlinear transform between density and flux
quenches the fluctuations so that the flux power spectrum is much less
sensitive to cosmological parameters than the one-dimensional mass power
spectrum. The covariance of the flux power spectrum is nearly Gaussian. As
such, the uncertainties of the underlying mass power spectrum could still be
large, even though the flux power spectrum can be precisely determined from a
small number of lines of sight.",2005-04-19T18:00:40Z
Formation of Massive Black Holes in Globular Clusters,"The hydrodynamic formation of massive black holes (BHs) in globular clusters
is considered. In particular, we examine the possibility of the BH formation
induced by the radiation drag that is exerted on the interstellar matter by
stellar radiation in globular clusters. The radiation drag extracts angular
momentum from interstellar gas and thus allows the gas to accrete on to the
cluster center.By incorporating the realistic chemical evolution of globular
clusters, we scrutinize the efficiency of the radiation drag to assess the
total accreted mass. As a result, we find that if a globular cluster is more
massive than $\approx 6\times 10^{6}M_{\odot}$ in the present-day stellar
component, a massive BH with $>260M_{\odot}$ can form within it. But, the
BH-to-cluster mass ratio s considerably smaller than the BH-to-bulge mass ratio
($\approx 10^{-3}$) found in galactic bulges. The results are not sensitive to
the assumed stellar initial mass function and star formation rate in the
cluster, as long as the resultant color-magnitude relation, metallicity, and
mass-to-luminosity ratio satisfy those observed in globular clusters. Hence,
the putative linear relation between BH mass and bulge mass($M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm
bulge}$ relation) cannot be extrapolated to globular cluster systems. In the
present regime, we discuss the BH formation in M15, G1, $\omega$ Cen, the M33
nucleus, and the compact X-ray sources in M82. Finally, we argue observational
indications of the formation process of massive BHs in globular clusters. We
find that the final phase of BH growth due to the radiation drag can be
observed as ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with $\sim 10^{41}{\rm erg} {\rm
s}^{-1}$.",2005-04-08T14:23:09Z
"Spectroscopic classification of red high proper motion objects in the
  Southern Sky","We present the results of spectroscopic follow-up observations for a sample
of 71 red objects with high proper motions in the range 0.08-1.14 arcsec/yr as
detected using APM and SSS measurements of multi-epoch photographic Schmidt
plates. Red objects were selected by combining the photographic BjRI magnitudes
with 2MASS near-infrared JHKs magnitudes. Some 50 of the 71 spectroscopically
classified objects turn out to be late-type (>M6) dwarfs and in more detail,
the sample includes 35 ultracool dwarfs with spectral types between M8 and L2,
some previously reported, as well as five M-type subdwarfs, including a cool
esdM6 object, SSSPM J0500-5406. Distance estimates based on the spectral types
and 2MASS J magnitudes place almost all of the late-type (>M6) dwarfs within 50
pc, with 25 objects located inside the 25 pc limit of the catalogue of nearby
stars. Most of the early-type M dwarfs are located at larger distances of
100-200 pc, suggesting halo kinematics for some of them. All objects with
Halpha equivalent widths larger than 10 Angstroms have relatively small
tangential velocities (<50 km/s). Finally, some late-type but blue objects are
candidate binaries.",2005-06-11T22:19:41Z
"Family ties: abundances in Terzan 7, a Sgr dSph globular cluster","We study the chemical composition of 5 giant stars in the globular cluster
Terzan 7 associated with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph),
based on high resolution UVES-VLT spectra. We confirm the metallicity found by
previous high resolution investigations: [Fe/H] ~ -0.6. We also show that this
cluster displays the same low alpha-element to iron ratio found in Sgr dSph
field stars of similar metallicity, as well as the same low Ni/Fe ratio. These
chemical signatures are characteristic of the Sgr dSph system, and appear to be
shared both by the globular cluster Pal 12, which was most likely stripped from
Sgr by tidal interaction, and by Pal 5, which may also have belonged in the
past to the Sgr dSph system. Intriguingly even globular cluster Ruprecht 106,
although not associated to Sgr, displays similar characteristics.",2005-05-14T10:27:32Z
"VLT Diffraction Limited Imaging and Spectroscopy in the NIR: Weighing
  the black hole in Centaurus A with NACO","We present high spatial resolution near-infrared spectra and images of the
nucleus of Centaurus A (NGC 5128) obtained with NAOS-CONICA at the VLT. The
adaptive optics corrected data have a spatial resolution of 0.06"" (FWHM) in K-
and 0.11"" in H-band, four times higher than previous studies. The observed gas
motions suggest a kinematically hot disk which is orbiting a central object and
is oriented nearly perpendicular to the nuclear jet. We model the central
rotation and velocity dispersion curves of the [FeII] gas orbiting in the
combined potential of the stellar mass and the (dominant) black hole. Our
physically most plausible model, a dynamically hot and geometrically thin gas
disk, yields a black hole mass of M_bh = (6.1 +0.6/-0.8) 10^7 M_sun. As the
physical state of the gas is not well understood, we also consider two limiting
cases: first a cold disk model, which completely neglects the velocity
dispersion; it yields an M_bh estimate that is almost two times lower. The
other extreme case is to model a spherical gas distribution in hydrostatic
equilibrium through Jeans equation. Compared to the hot disk model the best-fit
black hole mass increases by a factor of 1.5. This wide mass range spanned by
the limiting cases shows how important the gas physics is even for high
resolution data. Our overall best-fitting black hole mass is a factor of 2-4
lower than previous measurements. With our revised M_bh estimate, Cen A's
offset from the M_bh-sigma relation is significantly reduced; it falls above
this relation by a factor of ~2, which is close to the intrinsic scatter of
this relation. (Abridged)",2005-07-05T13:02:39Z
"A Possible Late Time $Λ$CDM-like Background Cosmology in
  Relativistic MOND Theory","In the framework of Relativistic MOND theory (TeVeS), we show that a late
time background $\Lambda$CDM cosmology can be attained by choosing a specific
$F(\mu)$ that also meets the requirement for the existence of Newtonian and
MOND limits. We investigate the dynamics of the scalar field $\phi$ under our
chosen $F(\mu)$ and show that the ""slow roll"" regime of $\phi$ corresponds to a
dynamical attractor, where the whole system reduces to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.",2005-04-05T23:10:09Z
Cosmic Ray Spectral Deformation Caused by Energy Determination Errors,"Using simulation methods, distortion effects on energy spectra caused by
errors in the energy determination have been investigated. For cosmic ray
proton spectra, falling steeply with kinetic energy E as E-2.7, significant
effects appear. When magnetic spectrometers are used to determine the energy,
the relative error increases linearly with the energy and distortions with a
sinusoidal form appear starting at an energy that depends significantly on the
error distribution but at an energy lower than that corresponding to the
Maximum Detectable Rigidity of the spectrometer. The effect should be taken
into consideration when comparing data from different experiments, often having
different error distributions.",2005-05-10T14:57:40Z
Scaling Dark Energy in a Five-Dimensional Bouncing Cosmological Model,"We consider a 5-dimensional Ricci flat bouncing cosmological model in which
the 4-dimensional induced matter contains two components at late times - the
cold dark matter (CDM)+baryons and dark energy. We find that the arbitrary
function $f(z)$ contained in the solution plays a similar role as the potential
$V(\phi)$ in quintessence and phantom dark energy models. To resolve the
coincidence problem, it is generally believed that there is a scaling stage in
the evolution of the universe. We analyze the condition for this stage and show
that a hyperbolic form of the function $f(z)$ can work well in this property.
We find that during the scaling stage (before $z\approx 2$), the dark energy
behaves like (but not identical to) a cold dark matter with an adiabatic sound
speed $c_{s}^{2}\approx 0$ and $p_{x}\approx 0$. After $z\approx 2$, the
pressure of dark energy becomes negative. The transition from deceleration to
acceleration happens at $z_{T}\approx 0.8$ which, as well as other predictions
of the $5D$ model, agree with current observations.",2005-07-11T12:36:40Z
"Time variations of the narrow FeII and HI spectral emission lines from
  the close vicinity of Eta Carinae during the spectral event of 2003","The spectrum of Eta Carinae and its ejecta shows slow variations over a
period of 5.5 years. However, the spectrum changes drastically on a time scale
of days once every period called the 'spectral event'. We report on variations
in the narrow emission line spectrum of gas condensations (the Weigelt blobs)
close to the central star during a spectral event. The rapid changes in the
stellar radiation field illuminating the blobs make the blobs a natural
astrophysical laboratory to study atomic photoprocesses. The different
responses of the HI Paschen lines, fluorescent <FeII> lines and forbidden
[FeII] lines allow us to identify the processes and estimate physical
conditions in the blobs. This paper is based on observations from the Pico dos
Dias Observatory (LNA/Brazil) during the previous event in June 2003.",2005-03-18T12:17:31Z
"On the periodic clustering of cosmic ray exposure ages of iron
  meteorites","Two recent papers claimed to have found a periodic variation of the galactic
cosmic ray (CR) flux over the last 1-2 Gyr, using the CR exposure ages of iron
meteorites. This was attributed to higher CR flux during the passage of the
Earth through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, as suggested by models. The
derived period was 143+-10 Myrs. We perform a more detailed analysis of the CR
exposure ages on the same data set, using extensive simulation to estimate the
influence of different error sources on the significance of the periodicity
signal. We find no evidence for significant clustering of the CR exposure ages
at a 143 Myr period nor for any other period between 100 and 250 Myrs. Rather,
we find the data to be consistent with being drawn from a uniform distribution
of CR exposure ages. The different conclusion of the original studies is due to
their neglecting the influence of (i) data treatment on the statistics, (ii)
several error sources, and (iii) number statistics.",2005-04-06T18:22:18Z
An absorbed view of a new class of INTEGRAL sources,"The European gamma-ray observatory INTEGRAL has found a group of hard X-ray
sources which are highly absorbed, i.e., with column densities higher than
about 10^{23}/cm^2. Here I give an overview of this class of INTEGRAL sources.
The X-ray, as well as the optical/IR, properties of these sources and their
location in the sky suggest that they belong to the class of high-mass X-ray
binaries, some of them possibly long-period X-ray pulsars. The donors in these
binaries are most probably giant or supergiant stars. I suggest that the soft
X-ray spectrum below ~5 keV of IGR J16318-4848, as well as in several other
X-ray binaries (e.g., XTE J0421+56), can be described by emission from a
compact object which is strongly absorbed by a partionally ionised dense
envelope.",2005-04-28T08:05:33Z
Gamma-Ray Burst Jet Profiles And Their Signatures,"HETE-II and BeppoSAX have produced a sample of GRBs and XRFs with known
redshifts and $E_{pk}$. This sample provides four important empirical
constraints on the nature of the source jets: Log $E_{iso}$ is approximately
uniformly distributed over several orders of magnitude; the inferred prompt
energy Log $E_{\gamma}$ is narrowly distributed; the Amati relation holds
between $E_{iso}$ and $E_{pk}$; and the Ghirlanda relation holds between
$E_{\gamma}$ and $E_{pk}$.
  We explore the implications of these constraints for GRB jet structure during
the prompt emission phase. We infer the underlying angular profiles from the
first two of the above constraints assuming all jets have the same profile and
total energy, and show that such ``universal jet'' models cannot satisfy both
constraints.
  We introduce a general and efficient method for calculating relativistic
emission distributions and $E_{pk}$ distributions from jets with arbitrary
(smooth) angular jet profiles. We also exhibit explicit analytical formulas for
emission from top-hat jets (which are not smooth). We use these methods to
exhibit $E_{pk}$ and $E_{iso}$ as a function of viewing angle, for several
interesting families of GRB jet profiles. We use the same methods to calculate
expected frequency distributions of $E_{iso}$ and $E_{\gamma}$ for the same
families of models.
  We then proceed to explore the behavior of universal jet models under a range
of profile shapes and parameters, to map the extent to which these models can
conform to the above four empirical constraints.",2005-05-31T14:48:53Z
Which Massive stars are Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors?,"The collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts requires three essential
ingredients: a massive core, removal of the hydrogen envelope, and enough
angular momentum in the core. We study current massive star evolution models of
solar metallicity to determine which massive star physics is capable of
producing these ingredients. In particular, we investigate the role of
hydrodynamic and magnetic internal angular momentum transport and binary mass
and angular momentum transfer. We follow the evolution of rotating single stars
and of binary systems that include rotational processes for both stars.
Neglecting magnetic fields, we show that the cores of massive single stars can
maintain a high specific angular momentum when evolved with the assumption that
mean molecular weight gradients suppress rotational mixing processes. In binary
systems that undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning the mass
receiving star accretes large amounts of high angular momentum material,
leading to a spin-up of the core. We find, however, that this merely
compensates for the tidal angular momentum loss due to spin-orbit coupling,
which leads to synchronous rotation before the mass transfer event. Therefore
the resulting cores do not rotate faster than in single stars. We also present
models that include magnetic fields generated by differential rotation and we
consider the internal angular momentum transport by magnetic torques. We
investigate the capability of magnetic torques to efficiently pump angular
momentum into the cores of accreting stars. Despite our finding that this
mechanism works, the magnetic coupling of core and envelope after the accreting
star ends core hydrogen burning leads to slower rotation than in the
non-magnetic case.",2005-04-07T10:43:51Z
"High-resolution radio imaging of the most distant radio quasar SDSS
  J0836+0054","We observed SDSS J0836+0054, the most distant radio-loud quasar known at
present (z=5.774) with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
Network at the 5 GHz frequency on 2003 November 4. The source is compact at the
milli-arcsecond (mas) angular scale with a flux density of 0.34 mJy. The
observations with the Very Large Array (VLA) made on the consecutive day
support a conclusion that the radio emission from SDSS J0836+0054 is
essentially confined within the central 40 pc. Based on our phase-referenced
VLBI observation, we obtained the astrometric position of the source accurate
to ~2 mas.",2005-04-20T07:42:40Z
"Evidence for a Weak Galactic Center Magnetic Field from Diffuse Low
  Frequency Nonthermal Radio Emission","New low-frequency 74 and 330 MHz observations of the Galactic center (GC)
region reveal the presence of a large-scale ($6\arcdeg\times 2\arcdeg$) diffuse
source of nonthermal synchrotron emission. A minimum energy analysis of this
emission yields a total energy of $\sim (\phi^{4/7}f^{3/7})\times 10^{52}$ ergs
and a magnetic field strength of $\sim 6(\phi/f)^{2/7}$ \muG (where $\phi$ is
the proton to electron energy ratio and $f$ is the filling factor of the
synchrotron emitting gas). The equipartition particle energy density is
$1.2(\phi/f)^{2/7}$ \evcm, a value consistent with cosmic-ray data. However,
the derived magnetic field is several orders of magnitude below the 1 mG field
commonly invoked for the GC. With this field the source can be maintained with
the SN rate inferred from the GC star formation. Furthermore, a strong magnetic
field implies an abnormally low GC cosmic-ray energy density. We conclude that
the mean magnetic field in the GC region must be weak, of order 10 \muG (at
least on size scales $\ga 125\arcsec$).",2005-05-12T09:36:21Z
"Nucleosynthesis of PopIII Core Collapse Supernovae and the Abundances of

Diffusive Acceleration of Ions at Interplanetary Shocks,"Heliospheric shocks are excellent systems for testing theories of particle
acceleration in their environs. These generally fall into two classes: (1)
interplanetary shocks that are linear in their ion acceleration
characteristics, with the non-thermal ions serving as test particles, and (2)
non-linear systems such as the Earth's bow shock and the solar wind termination
shock, where the accelerated ions strongly influence the magnetohydrodynamic
structure of the shock. This paper explores the modelling of diffusive
acceleration at a particular interplanetary shock, with an emphasis on
explaining in situ measurements of ion distribution functions. The
observational data for this event was acquired on day 292 of 1991 by the
Ulysses mission. The modeling is performed using a well-known kinetic Monte
Carlo simulation, which has yielded good agreement with observations at several
heliospheric shocks, as have other theoretical techniques, namely hybrid plasma
simulations, and numerical solution of the diffusion-convection equation. In
this theory/data comparison, it is demonstrated that diffusive acceleration
theory can, to first order, successfully account for both the proton
distribution data near the shock, and the observation of energetic protons
farther upstream of this interplanetary shock than lower energy pick-up
protons, using a single turbulence parameter. The principal conclusion is that
diffusive acceleration of inflowing upstream ions can model this pick-up
ion-rich event without the invoking any seed pre-acceleration mechanism, though
this investigation does not rule out the action of such pre-acceleration.",2005-06-08T19:23:59Z
"The INTEGRAL/IBIS source AXJ1838.0-0655: a soft X-ray to TeV gamma-ray
  broad band emitter","We report on INTEGRAL observations of AX J1838.0-0655, one of the
unidentified objects listed in the first IBIS/ISGRI survey catalogue and
located in the Scutum arm region. This object, detected in the 20-300 keV band
at a confidence level of 15.3 sigma (9 x 10^-11 erg cm-2 s-1) is the likely
counterpart of the still unidentified TeV source HESS J1837-069. It has been
detected in the past by various X-ray telescopes, including ASCA, implying that
it is a persistent rather than a transient source; the ASCA image is compatible
with the source not being resolved. The broad 1-300 keV spectrum is
characterized by an absorbed (NH = 6.7+/-1.3 x 10^22 cm-2) and hard (Gamma =1.5
+/- 0.2) power law continuum. Possible counterparts (radio and infrared)
present within the X-ray error box are discussed, even if no clear association
can be identified. The broad band spectrum together with the TeV detection
suggests that AX J1838.0-0655 maybe a supernova remnant or a pulsar wind
nebula, which has so far eluded detection in the radio band. This is the second
unidentified HESS source that shows a substantial soft gamma-ray emission.",2005-07-28T09:56:27Z
"RXJ0142.0+2131: I. The galaxy content of an X-ray-luminous galaxy
  cluster at z=0.28","We present a photometric and spectroscopic study of stellar populations in
the X-ray-luminous cluster of galaxies RXJ0142.0+2131 at z=0.280. This paper
analyses the results of high signal-to-noise spectroscopy, as well as g'-, r'-,
and i'-band imaging, using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on Gemini
North. Of 43 spectroscopic targets, we find 30 cluster members over a range in
color. Central velocity dispersions and absorption-line strengths for lines in
the range 3700A < lambda_rest < 5800A are derived for cluster members, and are
compared with a low-redshift sample of cluster galaxies, and single stellar
population (SSP) models. We use a combination of these indicators to estimate
luminosity-weighted mean ages, metallicities ([M/H]), and alpha-element
abundance ratios ([alpha/Fe]).
  RXJ0142.0+2131 is a relatively poor cluster and lacks galaxies with high
central velocity dispersions. Although the red sequence and the Faber-Jackson
relation are consistent with pure passive evolution of the early-type
population with a formation redshift of z_form = 2, the strengths of the 4000A
break and scaling relations between metal line indices and velocity dispersion
reject this model with high significance. By inverting SSP models for the
Hbeta_G, Mgb, and <Fe> line indices, we calculate that, at a given velocity
dispersion and metallicity, galaxies in RXJ0142.0+2131 have luminosity-weighted
mean ages 0.14 +- 0.07 dex older than the low-redshift sample. We also find
that [alpha/Fe] in stellar populations in RXJ0142.0+2131 is 0.14 +- 0.03
greater than at low redshift. All scaling relations are consistent with these
estimated offsets. (abridged)",2005-04-04T15:10:59Z
Polarization of high-energy pulsar radiation in the striped wind model,"The Stokes parameters of the pulsed synchrotron radiation produced in the
striped pulsar wind model are computed and compared with optical observations
of the Crab pulsar. We assume the main contribution to the wind emissivity
comes from a thin transition layer where the dominant toroidal magnetic field
reverses its polarity. The radial component of the field is neglected, but a
small meridional component is added. The resulting radiation is linearly
polarized (Stokes V=0). In the off-pulse region, the electric vector lies in
the direction of the projection on the sky of the rotation axis of the pulsar.
This property is unique to the wind model and in good agreement with the data.
Other properties such as a reduced degree of polarization and a characteristic
sweep of the polarization angle within the pulses are also reproduced. These
properties are qualitatively unaffected by variations of the wind Lorentz
factor, the electron injection power law index and the inclination of the line
of sight.",2005-05-20T06:14:48Z
The Mass of a Millisecond Pulsar,"We report on nearly two years of timing observations of the low-mass binary
millisecond pulsar, PSR J1909-3744 with the Caltech-Parkes-Swinburne Recorder
II (CPSR2), a new instrument that gives unprecedented timing precision. Daily
observations give a weighted rms residual of 74 ns, indicating an extremely low
level of systematic error. We have greatly improved upon the previous parallax
and proper motion measurements of PSR J1909-3744, yielding a distance of
$1.14^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ kpc and transverse velocity of $(200^{+7}_{-6})$ km
s$^{-1}$. The system's orbital eccentricity is just 1.35(12)$\times10^{-7}$,
the smallest yet recorded. Since their discovery, the masses of the rapidly
rotating millisecond pulsars have remained a mystery, with the recycling
hypothesis arguing for heavy objects, and the accretion-induced collapse of a
white dwarf more consistent with neutron stars less than the Chandrashkar
limit. Fortuitously, PSR J1909-3744 is an edge-on system, and our data have
allowed the measurement of the range and shape of the Shapiro delay to high
accuracy, giving the first precise determination of a millisecond pulsar mass
to date, $m_p = (1.438 \pm 0.024) M_\odot$. The mass of PSR J1909-3744 is at
the upper edge of the range observed in mildly recycled pulsars in double
neutron star systems, consistent with the the recycling hypothesis. It appears
that the production of millisecond pulsars is possible with the accretion of
less than $0.2 M_\odot$.",2005-07-18T20:22:24Z
"Constraining the Spectrum of Supernova Neutrinos from
  Neutrino-Process-Induced Light-Element Synthesis","We constrain energy spectra of supernova neutrinos through the avoidance of
an overproduction of the 11B abundance during Galactic chemical evolution. In
supernova nucleosynthesis calculations with a parametrized neutrino spectrum as
a function of temperature of mu- and tau-neutrinos and their antiparticles and
total neutrino energy, we find a strong neutrino temperature dependence of 11B
yield. When the yield is combined with observed abundances, the acceptable
range of the temperature of mu- and tau-neutrinos and their antiparticles is
found to be 4.8 and 6.6 MeV. Non-zero chemical potentials would reduce this
temperature range by about 10% for a degeneracy parameter smaller than 3.",2005-05-02T21:01:22Z
Faraday Rotation Measure Synthesis,"We extend the rotation measure work of Burn (1966) to the cases of limited
sampling of lambda squared space and non-constant emission spectra. We
introduce the rotation measure transfer function (RMTF), which is an excellent
predictor of n-pi ambiguity problems with the lambda squared coverage. Rotation
measure synthesis can be implemented very efficiently on modern computers.
Because the analysis is easily applied to wide fields, one can conduct very
fast RM surveys of weak spatially extended sources. Difficult situations, for
example multiple sources along the line of sight, are easily detected and
transparently handled. Under certain conditions, it is even possible to recover
the emission as a function of Faraday depth within a single cloud of ionized
gas. Rotation measure synthesis has already been successful in discovering
widespread, weak, polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster (De
Bruyn and Brentjens, 2005). In simple, high signal to noise situations it is as
good as traditional linear fits to polarization angle versus lambda squared
plots. However, when the situation is more complex or very weak polarized
emission at high rotation measures is expected, it is the only viable option.",2005-07-14T14:54:16Z
Imaging of the Radio Remnant of SN 1987A at 12 mm Wavelength,"Observations of the radio remnant of Supernova 1987A using the Australia
Telescope Compact Array in the 12-mm band on 2003 July 31 (day 6002.7 after the
explosion) give the first fully resolved radio image of the supernova remnant.
The diffraction-limited image has a resolution of about 0.45 arcsec, a factor
of two better than that of the 3-cm images previously obtained. There is
excellent agreement between the 12-mm image and a contemporaneous
super-resolved 3-cm image. Super-resolution of the 12-mm image gives a further
factor of two improvement in resolution, to 0.25 arcsec, albeit with limited
dynamic range. While the spatial distributions of the radio and X-ray emission
are broadly similar, there are significant differences in detail with no
correspondence in the regions of brightest emission. The 12-mm image is well
modelled by a thick equatorial ring inclined at 43 deg to the line of sight.
This, together with the common east-west asymmetry and the relatively steady
increase in the radio flux density, suggests that the reverse shock is the main
site for generation of the radio emission.",2005-06-20T22:27:55Z
"MACHe3, a prototype for non-baryonic dark matter search: KeV event
  detection and multicell correlation","Superfluid He3 at ultra-low temperatures (100 microKelvins) is a sensitive
medium for the bolometric detection of particles. MACHe3 (MAtrix of Cells of
Helium 3) is a project for non-baryonic dark matter search using He3 as a
sensitive medium. Simulations made on a high granularity detector show a very
good rejection to background signals. A multicell prototype including 3
bolometers has been developed to allow correlations between the cells for
background event discrimination. One of the cells contains a low activity Co57
source providing conversion electrons of 7.3 and 13.6 keV to confirm the
detection of low energy events. First results on the multicell prototype are
presented. A detection threshold of 1 keV has been achieved. The detection of
low energy conversion electrons coming from the Co57 source is highlighted as
well as the cosmic muon spectrum measurement. The possibility to reject
background events by using the correlation among the cells is demonstrated from
the simultaneous detection of muons in different cells.",2005-04-28T13:11:14Z
"The open cluster initial-final mass relationship and the high-mass tail
  of the white dwarf distribution","Recent studies of white dwarfs in open clusters have provided new constraints
on the initial - final mass relationship (IFMR) for main sequence stars with
masses in the range 2.5 - 6.5 Mo. We re-evaluate the ensemble of data that
determines the IFMR and argue that the IFMR can be characterised by a mean
initial-final mass relationship about which there is an intrinsic scatter. We
investigate the consequences of the IFMR for the observed mass distribution of
field white dwarfs using population synthesis calculations. We show that while
a linear IFMR predicts a mass distribution that is in reasonable agreement with
the recent results from the PG survey, the data are better fitted by an IFMR
with some curvature. Our calculations indicate that a significant (~28%)
percentage of white dwarfs originating from single star evolution have masses
in excess of ~0.8 Mo, obviating the necessity for postulating the existence of
a dominant population of high-mass white dwarfs that arise from binary star
mergers.",2005-06-14T19:39:36Z
Near Infrared Imaging Survey of Bok Globules: Density Structure,"On the basis of near-infrared imaging observations, we derived visual
extinction (Av) distribution toward ten Bok globules through measurements of
both the color excess (E_{H-K}) and the stellar density at J, H, and Ks (star
count). Radial column density profiles for each globule were analyzed with the
Bonnor-Ebert sphere model. Using the data of our ten globules and four globules
in the literature, we investigated the stability of globules on the basis of
xi_max, which characterizes the Bonnor-Ebert sphere as well as the stability of
the equilibrium state against the gravitational collapse. We found that more
than half of starless globules are located near the critical state (xi_max =
6.5 +/- 2). Thus, we suggest that a nearly critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere
characterizes the typical density structure of starless globules. Remaining
starless globules show clearly unstable states (xi_max > 10). Since unstable
equilibrium states are not long maintained, we expect that these globules are
on the way to gravitational collapse or that they are stabilized by non-thermal
support. It was also found that all the star-forming globules show unstable
solutions of xi_max >10, which is consistent with the fact that they have
started gravitational collapse. We investigated the evolution of a collapsing
gas sphere whose initial condition is a nearly critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere. We
found that the column density profiles of the collapsing sphere mimic those of
the static Bonnor-Ebert spheres in unstable equilibrium. The collapsing gas
sphere resembles marginally unstable Bonnor-Ebert spheres for a long time. We
found that the frequency distribution of xi_max for the observed starless
globules is consistent with that from model calculations of the collapsing
sphere.",2005-06-09T14:33:51Z
"Timing measurements and proper motions of 74 pulsars using the Nanshan
  radio telescope","We have measured the positions of 74 pulsars from regular timing observations
using the Nanshan radio telescope at Urumqi Observatory between 2000 January
and 2004 August (MJD 51500 -- 53240). Proper motions were determined for these
pulsars by comparing their current positions with positions given in pulsar
catalogues. We compare our results to earlier measurements in the literature
and show that, in general, the values agree. New or improved proper motions are
obtained for 16 pulsars. The effect of period fluctuations and other timing
noise on the determination of pulsar positions is investigated. For our sample,
the mean and rms transverse velocities are 443 and 224 km/s respectively,
agreeing with previous work even though we determine distances using the new
NE2001 electron density model.",2005-06-30T11:44:15Z
"Magnetic-Reconnection and Current-Sheet Model for the Radio Arc and
  Threads in the Galactic Center","We propose a new mechanism to explain the radio Arc and threads in the
Galactic Center by current sheets produced by local magnetic shears due to
interaction of a moving cloud and the vertical field based on three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. Magnetic reconnetion and acceleration of
cosmic-ray electrons in the current sheet will result in high contrast of radio
emissivity inside and outside the Arc and threads.",2005-07-25T00:55:21Z
109 new Galactic open clusters,"We present a list of 130 Galactic Open Clusters, found in the All-Sky
Compiled Catalogue of 2.5 Million Stars (ASCC-2.5). For these clusters we
determined and publish a homogeneous set of astrophysical parameters such as
size, membership, motion, distance and age. In a previous work 520 already
known open clusters out of the sample of 1700 clusters from the literature were
confirmed in the ASCC-2.5 using independent, objective methods. Using these
methods the whole sky was systematically screened for the search of new
clusters. The newly detected clusters show the same distribution over the sky
as the known ones. It is found, that without the {\em a-priori} knowledge about
existing clusters our search lead to clusters which are, {\em on average},
brighter, have more members and cover larger angular radii than the 520
previously known ones.",2005-05-02T13:33:38Z
The age dependence of halo clustering,"We use a very large simulation of the concordance LCDM cosmogony to study the
clustering of dark matter haloes. For haloes less massive than about
1e13Msun/h, the amplitude of the two-point correlation function on large scales
depends strongly on halo formation time. Haloes that assembled at high redshift
are substantially more clustered than those that assembled more recently. The
effect is a smooth function of halo formation time and its amplitude increases
with decreasing halo mass. At 1e11 Msun/h the ``oldest'' 10% of haloes are more
than 5 times more strongly correlated than the ``youngest'' 10%. This
unexpected result is incompatible with the standard excursion set theory for
structure growth, and it contradicts a fundamental assumption of the halo
occupation distribution models often used to study galaxy clustering, namely
that the galaxy content of a halo of given mass is statistically independent of
its larger scale environment.",2005-06-21T20:09:45Z
Constraints on the sound speed of dark energy,"We have studied constraints on the equation of state, $w$, and speed of
sound, c_s, of the dark energy from a joint analysis of data from the cosmic
microwave background, large scale structure and type-Ia supernovae. We find
that current observations have no significant sensitivity to c_s. However,
there is a slight difference between models in which there are no dark energy
perturbations and models in which dark energy behaves as a fluid. Assuming that
there are no dark energy perturbations shifts the allowed region for $w$ to
slightly higher values. At present models with and without dark energy
perturbations provide roughly equally good fits to observations, but the
difference is potentially important for future parameter estimations. Finally,
we have also performed error forecasts for future measurements of c_s.",2005-04-01T09:05:42Z
Polarization microvariability of BL Lac objects,"We present the results of a systematic observational campaign designed to
search for microvariability in the optical polarization of BL Lac objects. We
have observed a sample formed by 8 X-ray-selected and 10 radio-selected
sources, looking for rapid changes in both the degree of linear polarization
and the corresponding polarization angle. The whole campaign was carried out
along the last three years, and most of the objects were observed at least on
two consecutive nights. The statistical properties of both classes of BL Lac
objects are compared, and some general conclusions on the nature of the
phenomenon are drawn. In general, radio selected sources seem to display higher
duty cycles for polarimetric microvariability and, on average, they have a
stronger polarization.",2005-06-16T13:19:02Z
The sub-DLA toward HE0001-2340: galaxy formation at z=2,"We present a detailed analysis of chemical abundances in a sub-damped Ly
alpha absorber (sub-DLA) at z=2.187 towards the quasar HE0001-2340 (z_em=2.28)
using VLT/UVES data. This sub-DLA system consists of at least 25 individual
subcomponents spanning a restframe velocity range of ~400 km/s. Detected
species include CII, CIV, NI, NII, OI, MgII, AlII, AlIII, SiII, SiIV, PII,
FeII, and possibly DI. For the dominating neutral gas component at v=+13 km/s
we derive an oxygen abundance of [O/H]=-1.81. With its extremely low nitrogen
content ([N/H]<-3.3 and [N/O]<-1.5) the absorber exhibits a classic massive
star abundance pattern. The low [N/O] value is consistent with the idea that
primary nitrogen production by the very first stars have enriched the
intergalactic gas to a level of [N/O] ~ -1.5. Peculiar abundances are found in
the outermost blue components, where we observe significant overabundances of
phosphorus ([P/C] ~ +1.5), silicon ([Si/C] ~ +0.6), and aluminum ([Al/C] ~
+0.5). Our study suggests that the sight line passes through the gaseous
environment of one or more stellar clusters that locally enriched their
interstellar neighbourhood by supernova ejecta generating the observed
abundance anomalies. The large velocity spread of the entire absorption system
points to a merger that triggers the formation of these clusters. We thus may
be observing a young galaxy at z ~ 2 that currently forms out of a merger event
(abstract truncated).",2005-05-17T08:35:49Z
"Abundances from disentangled component spectra: the eclipsing binary
  V578 Mon","Chemical abundances of the early-B type components of the binary V578 Mon are
derived from disentangled component spectra. This is a pilot study showing
that, even with moderately high line-broadening, metal abundances can be
derived from disentangled spectra with a precision 0.1 dex, relative to
sharp-lined single stars of the same spectral type. This binary is well-suited
for such an assessment because of its youth as a member of the Rosette Nebula
cluster NGC 2244, strengthening the expectation of an unevolved ZAMS chemical
composition. The method is of interest to study rotational driven mixing in
main-sequence stars, with fundamental stellar parameters known with higher
accuracy in (eclipsing) binaries. The paper also includes an evaluation of the
bias that might be present in disentangled spectra.",2005-04-20T12:53:46Z
"The Structure and Star Formation History of Early-Type Galaxies in the
  UDF/GRAPES Survey","We present a two-pronged approach to the formation of early-type galaxies,
using a sample of 18 galaxies at 0.5 < z < 1 from the HST/ACS Ultra Deep Field
and GRAPES surveys: 1) We combine slitless low resolution spectroscopy from the
GRAPES dataset with simple models of galaxy formation to explore their star
formation histories. 2) We also perform an analysis of their surface brightness
distribution with the unprecedented details provided by the ACS superb angular
resolution and photometric depth. Our spectroscopic analysis reveals that their
stellar populations are rather homogeneous in age and metallicity and formed at
redshifts z ~ 2-5. Evolving them passively, they become practically
indistinguishable from ellipticals at z = 0. Also, their isophotal shapes
appear very similar to those observed for nearby ellipticals, in that the
percentages of disky and boxy galaxies at z ~ 1 are close to the values
measured at z = 0. Moreover,we find that the isophotal structure of z ~ 1
early-type galaxies obeys the correlations already observed among nearby
ellipticals, i.e. disky ellipticals have generally higher characteristic
ellipticities, and boxy ellipticals have larger half-light radii and are
brighter in the restframe B band. In this respect then, no significant
structural differences are seen for ellipticals between z = 0 and 1.",2005-04-12T08:52:02Z
Cosmic rays at ultra high energies (Neutrinos!),"Resonant photopion production with the cosmic microwave background predicts a
suppression of extragalactic protons above the famous Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin
cutoff at about E_{GZK} ~ 5 x 10^10 GeV. Current cosmic ray data measured by
the AGASA and HiRes Collaborations do not unambiguously confirm the GZK cutoff
and leave a window for speculations about the origin and chemical composition
of the highest energy cosmic rays. In this work we analyze the possibility of
strongly interacting neutrino primaries and derive model-independent
quantitative requirements on the neutrino-nucleon inelastic cross section for a
viable explanation of the cosmic ray data. Search results on weakly interacting
cosmic particles from the AGASA and RICE experiments are taken into account
simultaneously. Using a flexible parameterization of the inelastic
neutrino-nucleon cross section we find that a combined fit of the data does not
favor the Standard Model neutrino-nucleon inelastic cross section, but
requires, at 90 % confidence level, a steep increase within one energy decade
around E_{GZK} by four orders of magnitude. We illustrate such an enhancement
within some extensions of the Standard Model. The impact of new cosmic ray data
or cosmic neutrino search results on this scenario, notably from the Pierre
Auger Observatory soon, can be immediately evaluated within our approach.",2005-06-28T15:00:23Z
Seeing the Nature of the Accelerating Physics: It's a SNAP,"For true insight into the nature of dark energy, measurements of the
precision and accuracy of the Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) are required.
Precursor or scaled-down experiments are unavoidably limited, even for
distinguishing the cosmological constant. This white paper presents an overview
of the necessity for SNAP and the role of precursor experiments; accompanying
white papers detail the supernovae and weak lensing parts of the experiment.",2005-07-19T20:30:46Z
How is Binary Radio-Pulsars with Black Holes Population Rich?,"Using ""Scenario Machine"" we have carried out population synthesis of radio
pulsar with black hole binaries (BH+Psr) in context of the most wide
assumptions about star mass loss during evolution, binary stars mass ratio
distribution, kick velocity and envelope mass lost during collapse. Our purpose
is to display that under any suppositional parameters of evolution scenario
BH+Psr population have to be abundant in Galaxy. It is shown that in the all
models including models evolved by Heger et al. (2002), Woosley et al. (2002),
Heger et al. (2003) expected number of the black holes paired with radio
pulsars is sufficient enough to discover such systems within the next few
years.",2005-03-16T12:31:02Z
"Evolution of protoplanetary disks: Constraints from DM Tauri and GM
  Aurigae","We present a one-dimensional model of the formation and viscous evolution of
protoplanetary disks. The formation of the early disk is modeled as the result
of the gravitational collapse of an isothermal molecular cloud. The disk's
viscous evolution is integrated according to two parameterizations of
turbulence: The classical $\alpha$ representation and a $\beta$
parameterization, representative of non-linear turbulence driven by the
keplerian shear. We apply the model to DM Tau and GM Aur, two classical T-Tauri
stars with relatively well-characterized disks, retrieving the evolution of
their surface density with time. We perform a systematic Monte-Carlo
exploration of the parameter space (i.e. values of the $\alpha$-$\beta$
parameters, and of the temperature and rotation rate in the molecular cloud) to
find the values that are compatible with the observed disk surface density
distribution, star and disk mass, age and present accretion rate. We find that
the observations for DM Tau require $0.001<\alpha<0.1$ or $2\times
10^{-5}<\beta<5\times 10^{-4}$. For GM Aur, we find that the turbulent
viscosity is such that $4\times 10^{-4}<\alpha<0.01$ or $2\times
10^{-6}<\beta<8\times 10^{-5}$. These relatively large values show that an
efficient turbulent diffusion mechanism is present at distances larger than
$\sim 10 $AU. This is to be compared to studies of the variations of accretion
rates of T-Tauri stars versus age that mostly probe the inner disks, but also
yield values of $\alpha\sim 0.01$. We show that the mechanism responsible for
turbulent diffusion at large orbital distances most probably cannot be
convection because of its suppression at low optical depths.",2005-06-21T15:16:19Z
"A Study of Edge-On Galaxies with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced
  Camera for Surveys. II. Vertical distribution of the resolved stellar
  population","We analyze the vertical distribution of the resolved stellar populations in
six low-mass, edge-on, spiral galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope
Advanced Camera for Surveys. In each galaxy we find evidence for an extraplanar
stellar component extending up to 15 scale heights (3.5 kpc) above the plane.
We analyze the vertical distribution as a function of stellar age by tracking
changes in the color-magnitude diagram. The young stellar component (<10^8 yrs)
is found to have a scale height larger than the young component in the Milky
Way, suggesting that stars in these low mass galaxies form in a thicker disk.
We also find that the scale height of a stellar population increases with age,
with young main sequence stars, intermediate age asymptotic giant branch stars,
and old red giant branch stars having succesively larger scale heights in each
galaxy. This systematic trend indicates that disk heating must play some role
in producing the extraplanar stars. We constrain the rate of disk heating using
the observed trend between scale height and stellar age, and find that the
observed heating rates are dramatically smaller than in the Milky Way. The
color distributions of the red giant branch stars well above the midplane
indicate that the extended stellar components we see are moderately metal-poor,
with peak metallicities around [Fe/H]=-1 and with little or no metallicity
gradient with height. The lack of metallicity gradient can be explained if a
majority of extraplanar RGB stars were formed at early times and are not
dominated by a younger heated population. Our observations suggest that, like
the Milky Way, low-mass disk galaxies also have multiple stellar components. In
its structure, mean metallicity and old age, the RGB component in these
galaxies seems analagous to the Milky Way thick disk. [ABRIDGED]",2005-06-06T17:32:45Z
SAPAC: a SBF analysis pipeline for the astronomical community,"Large volumes of CCD imaging data that will become available from wide-field
cameras at telescopes such as the CFHT, SUBARU, VST, or VISTA in the near
future are highly suitable for systematic distance surveys of early-type
galaxies using the Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) method. For the
efficient processing of such large data sets, we are developing the first
semi-automatic SBF analysis pipeline named SAPAC. After a brief description of
the SBF method we discuss the image quality needed for a successful distance
measurement and give some background information on SAPAC",2005-08-01T04:34:05Z
"Gravitational signals due to tidal interactions between white dwarfs and
  black holes","In this paper we compute the gravitational signal emitted when a white dwarf
moves around a black hole on a closed or open orbit using the affine model
approach. We compare the orbital and the tidal contributions to the signal,
assuming that the star moves in a safe region where, although very close to the
black hole, the strength of the tidal interaction is insufficient to provoque
the stellar disruption. We show that for all considered orbits the tidal signal
presents sharp peaks corresponding to the excitation of the star non radial
oscillation modes, the amplitude of which depends on how deep the star
penetrates the black hole tidal radius and on the type of orbit. Further
structure is added to the emitted signal by the coupling between the orbital
and the tidal motion.",2005-08-08T13:43:01Z
"Near Infrared Survey of Populous Clusters in the LMC: Preliminary
  Results","We report preliminary results from our near-infrared JHK survey of star
clusters in the LMC. The primary goals of the survey are to study the
three-dimensional structure and distance of the LMC. In 2003 and 2004 we used
the Infrared Side Port Imager (ISPI) on the CTIO 4m to obtain near infrared
photometry for a sample of populous LMC clusters. We utilize the K-band
luminosity of core helium burning red clump (RC) stars to obtain individual
cluster distances and present a preliminary assessment of the structure and

"Outflowing material in the CSS quasar 3C48: evidence of jet-cloud
  interaction?","We report the detection of a zabs=0.3654 associated absorption-line system in
the UV spectrum of the CSS quasar 3C48. The absorbing material is blue shifted
with respect to the quasar emission-line redshift, zem=0.3700, suggesting an
outflow velocity of ~1000 km/s. We detect absorption lines over a range of
ionization states from Ly-beta, Ly-gamma, CIV, NIV, SVI to OVI and possibly OIV
and NeVIII. The kinematical properties of the absorption-line system are
similar to the blue-shifted emission line gas seen in [OIII]\lambda5007
(Chatzichristou, Vanderriest & Jaffe 1999), which is believed to have
interacted with the radio jet. We study the properties of the absorbing
material using CLOUDY and find that photoionization models with Solar abundance
ratios (with overall metallicity in the range 0.1<Z/Z$_\odot$<1.3) are enough
to explain the observed column densities of all the species except NeVIII,
detection of which requires confirmation. Since the cooling and recombination
time for the gas is ~10^5 yr, the consistency with the photoionization models
suggests that any possible interaction of absorbing material with the jet must
have taken place before ~10^5 yr. The abundance ratio of nitrogen to carbon is
close to Solar values, unlike in the case of most quasars, especially at
high-redshifts, which have super-Solar values. We observed 3C48 with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to search for redshifted 21cm HI absorption.
However, we did not detect any significant feature in our spectra and estimate
the 3-sigma upper limit to the optical depth to be in the range 0.001 to 0.003.
However, due to the diffuse nature of the radio source, optical depths as high
as 0.1 towards individual knots or compact components cannot be ruled out.",2005-05-06T12:57:43Z
"Transport and mixing in the radiation zones of rotating stars II.
  Axisymmetric magnetic field","The purpose of this paper is to improve the modeling of the mixing of
chemical elements that occurs in stellar radiation zones. In addition to the
classical rotational mixing considered in our previous paper, which results of
the combined action of the thermally-driven meridional circulation and of the
turbulence generated by the shear of differential rotation, we include here the
effect of an axisymmetric magnetic field in a self-consistent way. We treat the
advection of the field by the meridional circulation, its Ohmic diffusion, and
the production of its toroidal component through the shear of differential
rotation. The Lorentz force is assumed not to exceed the centrifugal force; it
acts on the baroclinic balance and therefore on the meridional flow, and it has
a strong impact on the transport of angular momentum. All variables and
governing equations are expanded in spherical or spherical vectorial functions,
to arbitrary order: this yields a system of partial differential equations in
time and in the radial coordinate, which is ready to be implemented in a
stellar structure code.",2005-06-06T09:20:32Z
Effects of clumping on temperature I: externally heated clouds,"We present a study of radiative transfer in dusty, clumpy star-forming
regions. A series of self-consistent, 3-D, continuum radiative transfer models
are constructed for a grid of models parameterized by central luminosity,
filling factor, clump radius, and face-averaged optical depth. The temperature
distribution within the clouds is studied as a function of this
parameterization. Among our results, we find that: (a) the effective optical
depth is smaller in clumpy regions than in equivalent homogeneous regions; (b)
penetration of radiation is drive by the fraction of open sky (FOS) -- which
measures the fraction of solid angle which is devoid of clumps; (c) FOS
increases as clump radius increases and filling factor decreases; (d) for FOS >
0.6-0.8 the sky is sufficiently open that the temperature is relatively
insensitive to FOS; (e) the physical process by which radiation penetrates is
streaming between clumps; (f) filling factor dominates the temperature
distribution for large optical depths, and at small clump radii for small
optical depths; (g) at lower optical depths, the temperature distribution is
most sensitive to filling factors of 1-10 per cent, in accordance with many
observations; (h) direct shadowing can be important approximately one clump
radius behind a clump.",2005-06-29T18:57:18Z
GMOS-IFU Spectroscopy of 167-317 (LV2) Proplyd in Orion,"We present high spatial resolution spectroscopic observations of the proplyd
167-317 (LV2) near the Trapezium cluster in the Orion nebula, obtained during
the System Verification run of the Gemini Multi Object Spectrograph (GMOS)
Integral Field Unit (IFU) at the Gemini South Observatory. We have detected 38
forbidden and permitted emission lines associated with the proplyd and its
redshifted jet. We have been able to detect three velocity components in the
profiles of some of these lines: a peak with a 28-33 km/s systemic velocity
that is associated with the photoevaporated proplyd flow, a highly redshifted
component associated with a previously reported jet (which has receding
velocities of about 80-120 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity and is
spatially distributed to the southeast of the proplyd) and a less obvious,
approaching structure, which may possibly be associated with a faint
counter-jet with systemic velocity of (-75 +/- 15) km/s. We find evidences that
the redshifted jet has a variable velocity, with slow fluctuations as a
function of the distance from the proplyd. We present several background
subtracted, spatially distributed emission line maps and we use this
information to obtain the dynamical characteristics over the observed field.
Using a simple model and with the extinction corrected Halpha fluxes, we
estimate the mass loss rate for both the proplyd photoevaporated flow and the
redshifted microjet, obtaining (6.2 +/- 0.6) x 10^{-7} M_sun/year and (2.0 +/-
0.7) x 10^{-8} M_sun/year, respectively.",2005-06-14T16:24:16Z
"Using the seismology of non-magnetic chemically peculiar stars as a
  probe of dynamical processes in stellar interiors","Chemical composition is a good tracer of hydrodynamical processes that occur
in stars as they often lead to mixing and particle transport. By comparing
abundances predicted by models and those observed in stars we can infer some
constraints on those mixing processes. As pulsations in stars are often very
sensitive to chemical composition, we can use asteroseismology to probe the
internal chemical composition of stars where no direct observations are
possible. In this paper I focus on main sequence stars Am, lambda bootis, and
HgMn stars and discuss what we can learn of mixing processes in those stars
from seismology.",2005-08-05T21:14:14Z
Molecular hydrogen in the diffuse interstellar medium at high redshift,"Physical conditions within DLAs can reveal the star formation history,
determine the chemical composition of the associated ISM, and hence document
the first steps in the formation of present day galaxies. Here we present
calculations that self-consistently determine the gas ionization, level
populations (atomic fine-structure levels and rotational levels of H_2), grain
physics, and chemistry. We show that for a low-density gas (n< 0.1 cm^-3) the
meta-galactic UV background due to quasars is sufficient to maintain H_2 column
densities below the detection limit (i.e N(H_2)< 10^14 cm^-2) irrespective of
the metallicity and dust content in the gas. Such a gas will have a 21 cm spin
temperature in excess of 7000 K and very low C I and C II* column densities for
H I column densities typically observed in DLAs. We show that the observed
properties of the ~15% per cent of the DLAs that do show detectable H_2
absorption cannot be reproduced with only the quasar dominated meta-galactic UV
radiation field. Gas with higher densities (n>10 cm^-3), a moderate radiation
field (flux density one to ten times that of the background radiation of the
Galactic ISM), the observed range of metallicity and dust-to-gas ratio
reproduce all the observed properties of the DLAs that show H_2 absorption
lines. This favors the presence of ongoing star formation in DLAs with H_2. The
absence of detectable H_2 and C I absorption in a large fraction of DLAs can be
explained if they originate either in a low-density gas or in a high-density
gas with a large ambient radiation field. The absence of 21 cm absorption and C
II* absorption will be consistent with the first possibility. The presence of
21 cm absorption and strong C II* without H_2 and C I absorption will suggest
the second alternative. (Abridged)",2005-06-23T09:45:48Z
On the metallicity dependence of Wolf-Rayet winds,"We have performed a pilot study of mass loss predictions for late-type
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars as a function of metal abundance, over a range between
10^{-5} < (Z/Zsun) < 10. We find that the winds of nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet
stars are dominated by iron lines, with a dependence of mass loss on Z similar
to that of massive OB stars. For more evolved, carbon-rich, WR stars the wind
strength is also found to be dependent on the Fe abundance, so that they depend
on the chemical environment of the host galaxy, but with a mass loss
metallicity dependence that is less steep than for OB stars. Our finding that
WR mass loss is Z-dependent is a new one, with important consequences for black
hole formation and X-ray population studies in external galaxies. A further
finding of our study is that the Z dependence of C-rich WR stars becomes weaker
at metallicities below Z/Zsun < 1/10, and mass loss no longer declines once the
metal abundance drops below (Z/Zsun) = 10^{-3}. This is the result of an
increased importance of radiative driving by intermediate mass elements, such
as carbon. In combination with rapid rotation and/or proximity to the Eddington
limit -- likely to be relevant for massive Population III stars -- this effect
may indicate a role for mass loss in the appearance and evolution of these
objects, as well as a potential role for stellar winds in enriching the
intergalactic medium of the early Universe.",2005-07-14T16:02:44Z
On the nature of the X-ray source in GK Per,"We report XMM-Newton observations of the intermediate polar (IP) GK Per on
the rise to the 2002 outburst and compare them to Chandra observations during
quiescence. We find an asymmetric spin light curve implying an asymmetric shape
of a semi-transparent accretion curtain. A low Fe xvii (15.01/15.26 A) line
flux ratio confirms the need for an asymmetric geometry and significant effects
of resonant line scattering. Medium resolution spectra in outburst and
quiescence are both fitted with a leaky absorber model for the post shock hard
X-ray emission, a black body (outburst) for the thermalized X-ray emission from
the white dwarf and an optically thin spectrum. The difference between high and
low spin as well as QPO/flares states can be explained by a variation in the
absorbing column density. The Fe fluorescence at 6.4 keV (equivalent width of
447 eV) is not significantly variable during spin cycle or on QPO periods.
High-resolution RGS spectra reveal a number of emission lines from H-like and
He-like elements. The lines are broader than the instrumental response with a
roughly constant velocity dispersion for different lines, indicating identical
origin. He-like emission lines are used to give values for the electron
densities of log n_e ~ 12. We do not detect any variation in the emission lines
during the spin cycle, implying that the lines are not noticeably obscured or
absorbed. We conclude that they originate in the accretion curtains and propose
a model for their shape.",2005-05-04T12:41:16Z
Non-linear perturbations in multiple-field inflation,"We develop a non-linear framework for describing long-wavelength
perturbations in multiple-field inflation. The basic variables describing
inhomogeneities are defined in a non-perturbative manner, are invariant under
changes of time slicing on large scales and include both matter and metric
perturbations. They are combinations of spatial gradients generalising the
gauge-invariant variables of linear theory. Dynamical equations are derived and
supplemented with stochastic source terms which provide the long-wavelength
initial conditions determined from short-wavelength modes. Solutions can be
readily obtained via numerical simulations or analytic perturbative expansions.
The latter are much simpler than the usual second-order perturbation theory.
Applications are given in a companion paper.",2005-04-22T19:33:34Z
Self-interaction spin effects in inspiralling compact binaries,"Gravitational radiation drives compact binaries through an inspiral phase
towards a final coalescence. For binaries with\textit{spin, mass quadrupole and
magnetic dipole moments}, various contributions add to this process, which is
characterized by the rate of increase $df/dt$ of the gravitational wave
frequency and the accumulated number $\mathcal{N}$ of gravitational wave
cycles. We present here all contributions to $df/dt$ and $% \mathcal{N}$ up to
the second post-Newtonian order. Among them we give for the first time the
contributions due to the \textit{self-interaction of individual spins}. These
are shown to be commensurable with the proper spin-spin contributions for the
recently discovered J0737-3039 double pulsar, and argued to represent the first
corrections to the radiation reaction in the Lense-Thirring approach.",2005-04-25T13:28:25Z
"The Extended Chandra Deep Field-South Survey. Chandra Point-Source
  Catalogs","We present Chandra point-source catalogs for the Extended Chandra Deep
Field-South (E-CDF-S) survey. The E-CDF-S consists of four contiguous 250 ks
Chandra observations covering an approximately square region of total solid
angle ~0.3 deg^2, which flank the existing ~1 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South
(CDF-S). The survey reaches sensitivity limits of 1.1 X 10^-16 erg/cm^2/s and
6.7 X 10^-16 erg/cm^2/s for the 0.5-2.0 keV and 2-8 keV bands, respectively. We
detect 762 distinct X-ray point sources within the E-CDF-S exposure; 589 of
these sources are new (i.e., not previously detected in the ~1 Ms CDF-S). This
brings the total number of X-ray point sources detected in the E-CDF-S region
to 915 (via the E-CDF-S and ~1 Ms CDF-S observations). Source positions are
determined using matched-filter and centroiding techniques; the median
positional uncertainty is ~0.35"". The basic X-ray and optical properties of
these sources indicate a variety of source types, although absorbed active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) seem to dominate. In addition to our main Chandra
catalog, we constructed a supplementary source catalog containing 33 lower
significance X-ray point sources that have bright optical counterparts (R<23).
These sources generally have X-ray-to-optical flux ratios expected for normal
and starburst galaxies, which lack a strong AGN component. We present basic
number-count results for our main Chandra catalog and find good agreement with
the ~1 Ms CDF-S for sources with 0.5-2.0 keV and 2-8 keV fluxes greater than 3
X 10^-16 erg/cm^2/s and 1 X 10^-15 erg/cm^2/s, respectively. Furthermore, three
extended sources are detected in the 0.5-2.0 keV band, which are found to be
likely associated with galaxy groups or poor clusters at z ~ 0.1-0.7; these
have typical rest-frame 0.5-2.0 keV luminosities of (1-5) X 10^42 erg/s.",2005-06-24T20:02:34Z
Grain Evolution across the Shocks in the L1448-mm Outflow,"The recent detection of shock-precursors toward the very young L1448-mm
outflow offers us the possibility to study the grain chemistry during the first
stages of the shock evolution, constraining the molecules ejected from grains
and the species formed in gas phase. Observations of key molecules in the grain
chemistry such as SiO, CH3OH, SO, CS, H2S, OCS, and SO2 toward this outflow are
presented. The line profiles and the derived abundances show three distinct
velocity regimes that trace the shock evolution: the preshock, the
shock-precursor and the postshock gas. The SiO, CH3OH, SO, and CS abundances
are enhanced with respect to the quiescent gas by 1 order of magnitude in the
shock-precursor component, and by 3 orders of magnitude in the postshock gas.
The derived SiO and CH3OH abundances are consistent with the recent ejection of
these molecules from grains. Since H2S is only enhanced in the shock-precursor
component, and OCS and SO2 are undetected, SO and CS are the most abundant
sulfur-bearing species in the grain mantles of L1448-mm. The ejection of mainly
SO and CS rather than H2S or OCS from grains, suggests that the sulfur
chemistry will depend on the chemical ""history"" of the grain mantles in
outflows and hot cores.",2005-06-17T11:21:15Z
The disk vanishes,"Recently published observations of VY Scl stars in their low,
long-intermediate and high states confirm our model (Hameury & Lasota 2002)
according to which accretion disks in such systems must vanish when their
temperature corresponds to thermally unstable configurations. An observational
confirmation of the hypothesis that the disk disappearance is caused by
magnetic effects would have important consequences for cataclysmic variable
evolution models.",2005-06-16T14:08:19Z
Low Power Compact Radio Galaxies at High Angular Resolution,"We present sub-arcsecond resolution multi-frequency (8 and 22 GHz)
  VLA images of five low power compact (LPC) radio sources, and phase
referenced VLBA images at 1.6 GHz of their nuclear regions. At the VLA
resolution we resolve the structure and identify component positions and flux
densities. The phase referenced VLBA data at 1.6 GHz reveals flat-spectrum,
compact cores (down to a few milliJansky) in four of the five sources. The
absolute astrometry provided by the phase referencing allows us to identify the
center of activity on the VLA images. Moreover, these data reveal rich
structures, including two-sided jets and secondary components. On the basis of
the arcsecond scale structures and of the nuclear properties, we rule out the
presence of strong relativistic effects in our LPCs, which must be
intrinsically small (deprojected linear sizes <~ 10 kpc). Fits of continuous
injection models reveal break frequencies in the GHz domain, and ages in the
range 10^5-10^7 yrs. In LPCs, the outermost edge may be advancing more slowly
than in more powerful sources or could even be stationary; some LPCs might also
have ceased their activity. In general, the properties of LPCs can be related
to a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: youth, frustration, low
kinematic power jets, and short-lived activity in the radio.",2005-06-21T14:33:00Z
Chemical composition of Galactic OB stars II. The fast rotator Z Oph,"Z Oph, HD149757, is an O9.5 Vnn star with a very high projected rotational
velocity (vsini >= 340 km\s). It is also a classical runaway star due to its
high proper motion. We perform a quantitative analysis of its optical spectrum
in order to measure important observables of the star such as its mass,
effective temperature, luminosity and He, C, N, and O abundances. Comparing
these observed values to those predicted by the rotating evolutionary models of
the Geneva group we find that none of the two sets of models is capable of
reproducing the characteristics of the star. Nevertheless, due to its runaway
nature, the reason for this discrepancy may be that the star is not the result
of the evolution of a single object, but the product of the evolution of a
close binary system.",2005-07-18T10:14:16Z
Dissipation in Pulsar Winds,"I review the constraints placed on relativistic pulsar winds by comparing
optical and X-ray images of the inner Crab Nebula on the one hand with
two-dimensional MHD simulations on the other. The various proposals in the
literature for achieving the low magnetisation required at the inner edge of
the Nebula, are then discussed, emphasising that of dissipation in the
striped-wind picture. The possibility of direct observation of the wind is
examined. Based on the predicted orientation of the polarisation vector, I
outline a new argument suggesting that the off-pulse component of the optical
emission of the Crab pulsar originates in the wind.",2005-04-19T12:47:45Z
"Explicit computation of shear three-point correlation functions: the
  one-halo model case","We present a method for calculating explicit expressions of the shear
three-point function for various cosmological models. The method is applied
here to the one-halo model in case of power law density profiles for which
results are detailed. The three-point functions are found to reproduce to a
large extent patterns in the shear correlations obtained in numerical
simulations and may serve as a guideline to implement optimized methods for
detecting the shear three-point function. In principle, the general method
presented here can also be applied for other models of matter correlation.",2005-05-16T11:59:19Z
"Optimal Choice of the Softening Length and Time-Step in N-body
  Simulations","A criterion for the choice of optimal softening length $\epsilon$ and
time-step $dt$ for $N$-body simulations of a collisionless stellar system is
analyzed. Plummer and Hernquist spheres are used as models to follow how
changes in various parameters of an initially equilibrium stable model depend
on $\epsilon$ and $dt$. These dependences are used to derive a criterion for
choosing $\epsilon$ and $dt$. The resulting criterion is compared to Merritt's
criterion for choosing the softening length, which is based on minimizing the
mean irregular force acting on a particle with unit mass. Our criterion for
choosing $\epsilon$ and $dt$ indicate that $\epsilon$ must be a factor of 1.5-2
smaller than the mean distance between particles in the densest regions to be
resolved. The time-step must always be adjusted to the chosen $\epsilon$ (the
particle must, on average, travel a distance smaller than $0.5\epsilon$ during
one time-step). An algorithm for solving N-body problems with adaptive
variations of the softening length is discussed in connection with the task of
choosing $\epsilon$, but is found not to be promising.",2005-04-26T11:36:58Z
"Simultaneous Ultraviolet and X-ray Observations of the Seyfert Galaxy
  NGC 4151. I. Physical Conditions in the X-ray Absorbers","We present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic X-ray absorption in the
Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151 using Chandra/HETGS data obtained 2002 May, as part
of a program which included simultaneous UV spectra using HST/STIS and FUSE.
NGC 4151 was in a relatively low flux state during the observations reported
here, although roughly 2.5 times as bright in the 2 --10 keV band as during a
Chandra observation in 2000. The soft X-ray band was dominated by emission
lines, which show no discernible variation in flux between the two
observations. The 2002 data show the presence of a very highly ionized
absorber, in the form of H-like and He-like Mg, Si, and S lines, as well as
lower ionization gas via the presence of inner-shell absorption lines from
lower-ionization species of these elements. The former is too highly ionized to
be radiatively accelerated in a sub-Eddington source such as NGC 4151. We find
that the lower ionization gas had a column density a factor of ~ 3 higher
during the 2000 observation. If due to bulk motion, we estimate that this
component must have a velocity of more than 1250 km/sec transverse to our
line-of-sight. We suggest that these results are consistent with a
magneto-hydrodynamic flow.",2005-07-14T17:22:56Z
"High resolution numerical modeling of the force-free pulsar
  magnetosphere","We consider the force-free magnetosphere of an aligned rotator. Its structure
is well described by a Grad-Shafranov equation for poloidal magnetic field, the
so-called ""pulsar equation"". We solve this equation by a multigrid method with
high numerical resolution. On the fine numerical grid current layer along the
last closed field line could be accurately incorporated into the numerical
procedure and all physical properties of the solution such as Goldreich-Julian
charge density, drift velocity, energy losses etc. could be accurately
calculated. Here we report results of the simulations. Among other interesting
properties, the solution is not unique, i.e. the position of the last closed
field line, and hence the pulsar energy losses, are not determined by the
global magnetosphere structure and depend on kinetic of electromagnetic
cascades. We discuss the properties of the solutions and their implications for
pulsars. A model for pulsar magnetosphere evolution is proposed. In the frame
of this model values of the pulsar braking index less than 3 have natural
explanation.",2005-07-03T20:26:48Z
Taxing the Rich: Recombinations and Bubble Growth During Reionization,"Reionization is inhomogeneous for two reasons: the clumpiness of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) and clustering of the discrete ionizing sources.
While numerical simulations can in principle take both into account, they are
at present limited by small box sizes. On the other hand, analytic models have
only examined the limiting cases of a clumpy IGM (with uniform ionizing
emissivity) and clustered sources (embedded in a uniform IGM). Here, we present
an analytic model for the evolving topology of reionization that includes both
factors. At first, recombinations can be ignored and ionized bubbles grow
primarily through major mergers. As a result, reionization resembles
""punctuated equilibrium,"" with a series of well-separated sharp jumps in the
ionizing background. These features are local effects and do not reflect
similar jumps in the global ionized fraction. We then combine our bubble model
with a simple description of recombinations in the IGM. We show that the
bubbles stop growing when recombinations balance ionizations. If the IGM
density structure is similar to that at moderate redshifts, this limits the
bubble radii to ~20 comoving Mpc; however, it may be much smaller if the IGM is
significantly clumpier at higher redshifts. Once a bubble reaches saturation,
that region of the universe has for all intents and purposes entered the
""post-overlap"" stage, so the overlap epoch actually has a finite width. This
picture naturally explains the substantial large-scale variation in
Lyman-series opacity along the lines of sight to the known z>6 quasars. More
quasar spectra will shed light on the transition between the ""bubble-dominated""
topology characteristic of reionization and the ""web-dominated"" topology
characteristic of the later universe. [Abridged]",2005-05-03T20:34:04Z
Numeric Spectrum of Relic Gravitational Waves in Accelerating Universe,"The accelerating expansion of the Universe at the present stage is a process
that will change the spectrum of relic gravitational waves. Here we present a
numerical calculation for the power spectrum of relic gravitational waves in
the accelerating Universe. The results show that although the overall features
of the power spectrum is similar to that in the non-accelerating models, the
amplitude is smaller by an order of $10^{-1}$. We also find that the spectrum
is very sensitive to the index $\beta$ of the inflationary expansion with the
scale factor $a(\tau) \propto |\tau|^{1+\beta}$. With increase of $\beta$, the
resulting spectrum is tilted to be flatter with more power on high frequencies,
and the sensitivity of the second science run of the LIGO detectors puts a
restriction on the parameter $\beta < -1.8$. The influence of reheating
following the inflation has been examined.",2005-05-30T05:03:33Z
A Hot Wind from the Classical T Tauri Stars: TW Hydrae and T Tauri,"Spectroscopy of the infrared He I (10830A) line with KECK/NIRSPEC and
IRTF/CSHELL, and of the ultraviolet C III (977A) and O VI (1032A) emission with
FUSE reveals that the classical T Tauri star TW Hydrae exhibits P Cygni
profiles, line asymmetries, and absorption indicative of a continuous, fast
(~400 km/s), hot (~300,000 K) accelerating outflow with a mass loss rate
\~10^-11 - 10^-12 solar masses per year, or larger. Spectra of T Tauri N appear
consistent with such a wind. The source of the emission and outflow seems
restricted to the stars themselves. Although the mass accretion rate is an
order of magnitude less for TW Hya than for T Tau, the outflow reaches higher
velocities at chromospheric temperatures in TW Hya. Winds from young stellar
objects may be substantially hotter and faster than previously thought.",2005-05-02T20:03:40Z
Detecting X-ray QPOs in Active Galaxies,"Since EXOSAT produced the first good quality X-ray light curves of Seyfert
galaxies there have been several claims of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).
None of these have withstood repeated analyses and observations. We review some
problems concerning the detection of QPOs.",2005-06-20T14:03:25Z
Observing Near Earth Asteroids with a Small Telescope,"Even from a light polluted city it is possible to observe Near Earth
Asteroids (NEAs) at opposition using a small telescope equipped with a CCD
camera. In this paper, we will overview first the major NEA programs,
continuing with planning the observations and the data reduction. Second, we
will present a NEA follow-up program carried out on the 60-cm telescope at York
University Observatory in Toronto, Canada. Part of this program, five NEAs have
been observed during ten nights. Their astrometric and photometric data were
reduced and sent to the Minor Planet Centre, following which an observatory
code was assigned and four batches have been included in the NEODyS database
and MPC Circulars. The results are applicable to any other small facility.",2005-04-11T02:56:29Z
"On the V-type asteroids outside the Vesta family. I. Interplay of
  nonlinear secular resonances and the Yarkovsky effect: the cases of 956 Elisa
  and 809 Lundia","Among the largest objects in the main belt, asteroid 4 Vesta is unique in
showing a basaltic crust. It is also the biggest member of the Vesta family,
which is supposed to originate from a large cratering event about 1 Gyr ago
(Marzari et al. 1996). Most of the members of the Vesta family for which a
spectral classification is available show a V-type spectra. Before the
discovery of 1459 Magnya (Lazzaro et al. 2000) and of several V-type NEA (Xu
1995), all the known V-type asteroids were members of the Vesta family.
Recently two V-type asteroids, 809 Lundia and 956 Elisa, (Florczak et al. 2002)
have been discovered well outside the limits of the family, near the Flora
family. We currently know 22 V-type asteroids outside the family, in the inner
asteroid belt. In this work we investigate the possibility that these objects
are former family members that migrated to their current positions via the
interplay of Yarkovsky effect and nonlinear secular resonances. The main
dynamical feature of 956 Elisa and 809 Lundia is that they are currently inside
the 2(g-g6)+s-s6 (z2 by Milani and Knezevic, 1993) secular resonance. Our
investigations show that members of the Vesta dynamical family may drift in
three-body and weak secular resonances until they are captured in the strong z2
secular resonance. Only asteroids with diameters larger than 16 km can remain
in one of the three-body or secular resonances long enough to reach the region
of the z2 resonance. This two-step mechanism of capture into the z2 resonance
could explain: i) the current resonant orbits of 956 Elisa and 809 Lundia, ii)
why their size is significantly larger than that of the typical member of the
Vesta family, and iii) provide a lower limit on the Vesta family age.",2005-06-27T17:00:07Z
"Evidence for the presence of dust in intervening QSO absorbers from the
  Sloan Digital Sky Survey","We find evidence for dust in the intervening QSO absorbers from the spectra
of QSOs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 1. No evidence is found
for the 2175 A feature which is present in the Milky Way dust extinction curve.
The extinction curve resembles the SMC extinction curve. The observed
Delta(g-i) excess for QSOs with strong absorption systems appears to be a
result of the reddening due to dust in the intervening absorbers.",2005-04-25T05:40:22Z
Microlensing of Central Images in Strong Gravitational Lens Systems,"We study microlensing of the faint images that form close to the centers of
strong gravitational lens galaxies. These central images, which have finally
begun to yield to observations, naturally appear in dense stellar fields and
may be particularly sensitive to fine granularity in the mass distribution. The
microlensing magnification maps for overfocussed (i.e., demagnified) images
differ strikingly from those for magnified images. In particular, the familiar
""fold"" and ""cusp"" features of maps for magnified images are only present for
certain values of the fraction, f, of the surface mass density contained in
stars. For central images, the dispersion in microlensing magnifications is
generally larger than for normal (minimum and saddle) images, especially when
the source is comparable to or larger than the stellar Einstein radius. The
dispersion depends in a complicated way on f; this behaviour may hold the key
to using microlensing as a probe of the relative densities of stars and dark
matter in the cores of distant galaxies. Quantitatively, we predict that the
central image C in PMN J1632-0033 has a magnification dispersion of 0.6
magnitudes for Rsrc/Rein <~ 1, or 0.3 mag for Rsrc/Rein = 10. For comparison,
the dispersions are 0.5-0.6 mag for image B and 0.05-0.1 mag for image A, if
Rsrc/Rein <~ 1; and just 0.1 mag for B and 0.008 mag for A if Rsrc/Rein = 10.
(The dispersions can be extrapolated to larger sources sizes as sigma \propto
Rsrc^{-1}.) Thus, central images are more susceptible than other lensed images
to microlensing and hence good probes for measuring source sizes.",2005-07-21T20:04:19Z
"A Millimeter Continuum Survey for Massive Protoclusters in the Outer
  Galaxy","Our search for the earliest stages of massive star formation turned up twelve
massive pre-protocluster candidates plus a few protoclusters. For this search,
we selected 47 FIR-bright IRAS sources in the outer Galaxy. We mapped regions
of several square arcminutes around the IRAS source in the millimeter continuum
in order to find massive cold cloud cores possibly being in a very early stage
of massive star formation. Masses and densities are derived for the 128
molecular cloud cores found in the obtained maps. We present these maps
together with near-infrared, mid-infrared, and radio data collected from the
2MASS, MSX, and NVSS catalogs. Further data from the literature on detections
of high-density tracers, outflows, and masers are added. The multi-wavelength
datasets are used to characterize each observed region. The massive cloud cores
(M>100 M_sun) are placed in a tentative evolutionary sequence depending on
their emission at the investigated wavelengths. Candidates for the youngest
stages of massive star formation are identified by the lack of detections in
the above-mentioned near-infrared, mid-infrared, and radio surveys. Twelve
massive cores prominent in the millimeter continuum fulfill this requirement.
Since neither FIR nor radio emission have been detected from these cloud cores
massive protostars must be very deeply embedded in these cores. Some of these
objects may actually Pre-Proto-cluster cores: an up to now rare object class,
where the initial conditions of massive star formation can be studied.",2005-08-08T13:56:17Z
"Comparison between methods for the determination of the primary cosmic
  ray mass composition from the longitudinal profile of atmospheric cascades","The determination of the primary cosmic ray mass composition from the
longitudinal development of atmospheric cascades is still a debated issue. In
this work we discuss several data analysis methods and show that if the entire
information contained in the longitudinal profile is exploited, reliable
results may be obtained. Among the proposed methods FCC ('Fit of the Cascade
Curve'), MTA ('Multiparametric Topological Analysis') and NNA ('Neural Net
Analysis') with conjugate gradient optimization algorithm give the best
accuracy.",2005-07-22T16:25:07Z
"A comparison of superradiance and negative-phase-velocity phenomenons in
  the ergosphere of a rotating black hole","The propagation of electromagnetic plane waves with negative phase velocity

although both phenomenons involve negative energy densities, there are two
significant differences between them.",2005-04-15T14:44:36Z
"Spatially Resolved STIS Spectra of Betelgeuse's Upper Chromosphere and
  Circumstellar Dust Envelope","The Hubble Space Telescope observed red supergiant Betelgeuse with the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to investigate the outer atmosphere from
spatially resolved spectra. We present a new set of seven high-resolution
near-UV spectra observed with HST-STIS in fall 2002 and spring 2003, by
scanning at chromospheric intensity peak-up position and six off-limb target
positions up to three arcseconds away from the star. A small aperture is used
to study and determine the thermal conditions and flow dynamics in its upper
chromosphere and inner circumstellar dust envelope. We provide the first
evidence for the presence of warm chromospheric plasma at least 3 arcseconds
away from Betelgeuse at ~120 R* (1 R* ~= 700 Rsun) based on detailed
spectroscopic observations of the Mg II h & k emission lines. Many other weak
chromospheric emission lines as Fe II lam2716, C II lam2327, Al II] lam2669,
and Fe I lam2823 are detected out to at least 1 arcsecond in the spatially
resolved STIS observations. The profiles of the Mg II h & k and the Si I
resonance emission lines reveal a strong increase of asymmetry by scanning
off-limb, signaling the outward acceleration of wind expansion in Betelgeuse's
upper chromosphere beyond 200 mas (~8 R*). We discuss detailed radiative
transfer models that fit the STIS observations showing that the local kinetic
gas temperature in the upper chromosphere exceeds 2600 K. Our radiation
transport models for the IR silicate dust emission at 9.8 um in the upper
chromosphere show however that the ambient gas temperature remains below 600 K
to sustain the presence of dust grains. Hence, the STIS spectra of Betelgeuse's
upper chromosphere directly demonstrate that warm chromospheric plasma must
co-exist with cool dusty plasma in its outer atmosphere.",2005-04-23T23:46:11Z
Magnetorotational Instability around a Rotating Black Hole,"The magnetorotational instability(MRI) in the Kerr spacetime is studied on a
3+1 viewpoint. The Maxwell's equations are expressed in a circularly orbiting
observer's frame that co-rotates with matter in Keplerian orbits. There exist
large proper growth rates in MRI around a rapidly rotating black hole. The
large ""centrifugal force"" and the rapid variations of magnetic fields are
caused by the rotation of spacetime geometry. As the result, in the extreme
Kerr case the maximum proper growth rate at $r=r_{ms}$ becomes about twelve
times as large as that in Schwartzshield case.",2005-04-01T14:08:25Z
Gravitational waves from remnants of ultraluminous X-ray sources,"Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with X-ray luminosities larger than the
Eddington luminosity of stellar mass objects may be powered by intermediate
mass black holes (IBHs) of masses Mbh~10^3Msun. If IBHs form in young dense
stellar clusters, they can be fed by Roche lobe overflow from a tidally
captured massive (Ms>10Msun) stellar companion. After the donor leaves the main
sequence it forms a compact remnant, which spirals in due to gravitational wave
(GW) emission. We show that space based detectors such as the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna are likely to detect several of these sources. GW
sources stemming from this scenario have small eccentricities which give
distinct GW signals. Detection of such a GW signal will unambiguously prove the
existence of IBHs, and support the hypothesis that some ULXs are powered by
IBHs with captured companions.",2005-06-08T20:03:02Z
The contribution of rotational velocity to the FP of elliptical galaxies,"The contribution of ordered rotation to the observed tilt and thickness of
the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies is studied by means of oblate,
two-integrals cuspy galaxy models with adjustable flattening, variable amount
of ordered rotational support, and possible presence of a dark matter halo and
of a central super-massive black hole. We find that, when restricting the
measure of the velocity dispersion to the central galactic regions, rotation
has a negligible effect, and so cannot be responsible of the observed tilt.
However, streaming velocity effect can be significant when observing small and
rotationally supported galaxies through large (relative) aperture (as for
example in Fundamental Plane studies at high redshift), and can lead to
unrealistically low mass-to-light ratios. The effect of a central supermassive
black hole on the kinematical fields, and the models position in the
v/sigma-ellipticity plane are also discussed.",2005-07-28T12:54:15Z
"Gauge-invariant perturbations at second order: multiple scalar fields on
  large scales","We derive the governing equations for multiple scalar fields minimally
coupled to gravity in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background
spacetime on large scales. We include scalar perturbations up to second order
and write the equations in terms of physically transparent gauge-invariant
variables at first and second order. This allows us to write the perturbed
Klein-Gordon equation at second order solely in terms of the field fluctuations
on flat slices at first and second order.",2005-06-22T17:31:59Z
"A contemporaneous infrared flash from a long gamma-ray burst: an echo
  from the central engine","The explosion that results in a cosmic gamma-ray burst (GRB) is thought to
produce emission from two physical processes -- the activity of the central
engine gives rise to the high-energy emission of the burst through internal
shocking and the subsequent interaction of the flow with the external
environment produces long-wavelength afterglow. While afterglow observations
continue to refine our understanding of GRB progenitors and relativistic
shocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of the
origin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine. Only one
concurrent visible-light transient has been found and was associated with
emission from an external shock. Here we report the discovery of infrared (IR)
emission contemporaneous with a GRB, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset of
GRB 041219a. Our robotic telescope acquired 21 images during the active phase
of the burst, yielding the earliest multi-colour observations of any
long-wavelength emission associated with a GRB. Analysis of an initial IR pulse
suggests an origin consistent with internal shocks. This opens a new
possibility to study the central engine of GRBs with ground-based observations
at long wavelengths.",2005-03-23T21:00:02Z
Massive Star Outflows,"Molecular outflows in the form of wide-angle winds and/or well-collimated
jets are associated with young stellar objects of all luminosities. Independent
studies have established that the mass outflow rate is proportional to
L_bol^0.6 for L_bol = 0.3 to 10^5 L_sun, suggesting that there is a strong link
between accretion and outflow for a wide range of source luminosity and there
is reasonable evidence that accretion-related processes are responsible for
generating massive molecular flows from protostars up to spectral type B0.
Beyond L_bol ~ 10^4 L_sun, O stars generate powerful wide-angle, ionized winds
that can dramatically affect outflow morphology and even call into question the
relationship between outflow and accretion.
  Recently Beuther & Shepherd (2005) proposed an evolutionary scenario in which
massive protostellar flows (up to early B spectral type) begin collimated. Once
the star reaches the Main Sequence, ionizing radiation may affect the balance
between magnetic and plasma pressure, inducing changes in the flow morphology
and energetics. Here I review the properties of outflows from young OB stars,
discuss implications and observational tests of this proposed evolutionary
scenario, and examine differences between low-mass and massive star formation.",2005-06-01T18:11:12Z
Acceleration of weakly collisional solar-type winds,"One of the basic properties of the solar wind, that is the high speed of the
fast wind, is still not satisfactorily explained. This is mainly due to the
theoretical difficulty of treating weakly collisional plasmas. The fluid
approach implies that the medium is collision dominated and that the particle
velocity distributions are close to Maxwellians. However the electron velocity
distributions observed in the solar wind depart significantly from Maxwellians.
Recent kinetic collisionless models (called exospheric) using velocity
distributions with a suprathermal tail have been able to reproduce the high
speeds of the fast solar wind. In this letter we present new developments of
these models by generalizing them over a large range of corona conditions. We
also present new results obtained by numerical simulations that include
collisions. Both approaches calculate the heat flux self-consistently without
any assumption on the energy transport. We show that both approaches - the
exospheric and the collisional one - yield a similar variation of the wind
speed with the basic parameters of the problem; both produce a fast wind speed
if the coronal electron distribution has a suprathermal tail. This suggests
that exospheric models contain the necessary ingredients for the powering of a
transonic stellar wind, including the fast solar one.",2005-05-16T16:13:09Z
"The properties of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies in hierarchical galaxy
  formation models","We present detailed predictions for the properties of Ly-alpha-emitting
galaxies in the framework of the Lambda-CDM cosmology, calculated using the
semi-analytical galaxy formation model GALFORM. We explore a model which
assumes a top-heavy IMF in starbursts, and which has previously been shown to
explain the sub-mm number counts and the luminosity function of Lyman-break
galaxies at high redshift. We show that this model, with the simple assumption
that a fixed fraction of Ly-alpha photons escape from each galaxy, is
remarkably successful at explaining the observed luminosity function of
Ly-alpha emitters over the redshift range 3<z<6.6. We also examine the
distribution of Ly-alpha equivalent widths and the broad-band continuum
magnitudes of emitters, which are in good agreement with the available
observations. We look more deeply into the nature of Ly-alpha emitters,
presenting predictions for fundamental properties such as the stellar mass and
radius of the emitting galaxy and the mass of the host dark matter halo. The
model predicts that the clustering of Ly-alpha emitters at high redshifts
should be strongly biased relative to the dark matter, in agreement with
observational estimates. We also present predictions for the luminosity
function of Ly-alpha emitters at z>7, a redshift range which is starting to be
be probed by near-IR surveys and using new instruments such as DAzLE.",2005-08-08T10:07:47Z
Aligning spinning black holes and accretion discs,"We consider the alignment torque between a spinning black hole and an
accretion disc whose angular momenta are misaligned. This situation must hold
initially in almost all gas accretion events on to supermassive black holes,
and may occur in binaries where the black hole receives a natal supernova kick.
We show that the torque always acts to align the hole's spin with the total
angular momentum without changing its magnitude. The torque acts dissipatively
on the disc, reducing its angular momentum, and aligning it with the hole if
and only if the angle theta between the angular momenta J_d of the disc and J_h
of the hole satisfies the inequality cos theta > -J_d / 2 J_h. If this
condition fails, which requires both theta > pi/2 and J_d < 2 J_h, the disc
counteraligns.",2005-07-05T14:57:03Z
"Possible Dark Matter Signals from Antiprotons, Positrons, X-rays and
  Gamma-rays","A number of signals involving charged cosmic rays and high-energy photons
have been interpreted as being due to annihilating dark matter. This article
provides an overview of the experimental evidence and discusses in particular
detections of antiprotons and positrons in the cosmic radiation, the diffuse
gamma-ray emission between 10 MeV and 100 GeV from the Milky Way, and the 511
keV annihilation radiation and the flux of very high-energy photons (>100 GeV)
from the Galactic Centre.",2005-05-13T15:42:06Z
Theoretical HDO emission from low-mass protostellar envelopes,"We present theoretical predictions of the rotational line emission of
deuterated water in low-mass protostar collapsing envelopes. The model accounts
for the density and temperature structure of the envelope, according the
inside-out collapse framework. The deuterated water abundance profile is
approximated by a step function, with a low value in the cold outer envelope
and a higher value in the inner envelope where the grain mantles evaporate. The
two abundances are the two main parameters of the modeling, along with the
temperature at which the mantles evaporate. We report line flux predictions for
a 30 and 5 L$_\odot$ source luminosity respectively. We show that ground based
observations are capable to constrain the three parameters of the model in the
case of bright low-mass protostars (L$>$10 L$_{\odot}$), and that no space
based observations, like for example HSO observations, are required in this
case. On the contrary, we show that the study of low-luminosity sources (L$<$10
L$_{\odot}$), assuming the same HDO abundance profile, requires too much
integration time to be carried out either with available ground-based
telescopes or with the HIFI instrument on board HSO. For these sources, only
the large interferometer ALMA will allow to constrain the HDO abundance.",2005-06-07T13:11:38Z
Spin-Dependent Cyclotron Decay Rates in Strong Magnetic Fields,"Cyclotron decay and absorption rates have been well studied in the
literature, focusing primarily on spectral, angular and polarization
dependence. Astrophysical applications usually do not require retention of
information on the electron spin state, and these are normally averaged in
obtaining the requisite rates. In magnetic fields, higher order quantum
processes such as Compton scattering become resonant at the cyclotron frequency
and its harmonics, with the resonances being formally divergent. Such
divergences are usually eliminated by accounting for the finite lifetimes of
excited Landau states. This practice requires the use of spin-dependent
cyclotron rates in order to obtain accurate determinations of process rates
very near cyclotronic resonances, the phase space domain most relevant for
certain applications to pulsar models. This paper develops previous results in
the literature to obtain compact analytic expressions for cyclotron decay
rates/widths in terms of a series of Legendre functions of the second kind;
these expressions can be expediently used in astrophysical models. The rates
are derived using two popular eigenstate formalisms, namely that due to Sokolov
and Ternov, and that due to Johnson and Lippmann. These constitute two sets of
eigenfunctions of the Dirac equation that diagonalize different operators, and
accordingly yield different spin-dependent cyclotron rates. This paper
illustrates the attractive Lorentz transformation characteristics of the
Sokolov and Ternov formulation, which is another reason why it is preferable
when electron spin information must be explicitly retained.",2005-05-16T17:49:42Z
"Increase in the Absorption Length of Inclined Extensive Air Showers with
  Different Selection Types","The dependence of the number of extensive air showers (EAS) on the zenith
angle is obtained in groups with a constant solid-angle step with different
election types at separations between stations of 500 and 1000 m by using the
Yakutsk EAS array data. A bend point is formed at the zenith angle
approximately of 50 deg. This point shifts with the increasing energy in the
direction corresponding to the shift of the cascade-curve maximum depth with
the variation of energy. The boundaries of change of these dependences obtained
separately at the distances between stations of 500 and 1000 m are different
that may be caused by the uncertainty of the lateral distribution function
(LDF) used. Thereby, energies of showers detected by the stations with a
different separation are not joined.",2005-06-28T01:23:09Z
Bulk motion Comptonization in black-hole accretion flows,"We study spectra generated by Comptonization of soft photons by cold
electrons radially free-falling onto a black hole. We use a Monte Carlo method
involving a fully relativistic description of Comptonization in the Kerr
space-time. In agreement with previous studies, we find that Comptonization on
the bulk motion of free fall gives rise to power-law spectra with the photon
index of Gamma >~ 3. In contrast to some previous studies, we find that these
power-law spectra extend only to energies << 511 keV. We indicate several
effects resulting in generic cutoffs of such spectra at several tens of keV,
regardless of any specific values of physical parameters in the model. This
inefficiency of producing photons with energies > 100 keV rules out bulk motion
Comptonization as a main radiative process in soft spectral states of
black-hole binaries. The normalization of the power law (below the cutoff) with
respect to the peak of the blackbody emission of the surrounding disc is
typically very low, except for models with an overlap between the disc and the
plasma, in which case the spectra are very soft, Gamma >~ 4.",2005-07-25T17:04:41Z
Measuring Galaxy Environments with Deep Redshift Surveys,"We study the applicability of several galaxy environment measures
(n^th-nearest-neighbor distance, counts in an aperture, and Voronoi volume)
within deep redshift surveys. Mock galaxy catalogs are employed to mimic
representative photometric and spectroscopic surveys at high redshift (z ~ 1).
We investigate the effects of survey edges, redshift precision, redshift-space
distortions, and target selection upon each environment measure. We find that
even optimistic photometric redshift errors (\sigma_z = 0.02) smear out the
line-of-sight galaxy distribution irretrievably on small scales; this
significantly limits the application of photometric redshift surveys to
environment studies. Edges and holes in a survey field dramatically affect the
estimation of environment, with the impact of edge effects depending upon the
adopted environment measure. These edge effects considerably limit the
usefulness of smaller survey fields (e.g. the GOODS fields) for studies of
galaxy environment. In even the poorest groups and clusters, redshift-space
distortions limit the effectiveness of each environment statistic; measuring
density in projection (e.g. using counts in a cylindrical aperture or a
projected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure) significantly improves the
accuracy of measures in such over-dense environments. For the DEEP2 Galaxy
Redshift Survey, we conclude that among the environment estimators tested the
projected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure provides the most accurate
estimate of local galaxy density over a continuous and broad range of scales.",2005-06-21T23:35:12Z
"Three routes to jet collimation by the Balbus-Hawley magnetorotational
  instability","Three completely different lines of work have recently led to the conclusion
that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) may create a hoop-stress that
collimates jets. One argument is based upon consideration that
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, in general, and turbulence driven by the MRI,
in particular, is more nearly viscoelastic than it is viscous. Another argument
is based upon the dispersion relation for the MRI in the context of 1D
simulations of core collapse. Yet a third argument rests in the results of
direct numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsars and thick
accretion flows. I elaborate on my previous work regarding the first argument
above and I briefly discuss how these three sets of results are all related. I
also discuss the different roles played by the magnetic tension and the
magnetic pressure within the context of this work. I point out that this leads
to consideration of the normal stress difference between the hoop stress and
the radial stress, in preference to a focus on just the hoop stress itself.
Additionally, I argue that simulations of thick accretion flows and collapsars
are not self-consistent if they include a phenomenological model for an
MRI-induced viscous stress but disregard these other MRI-induced stress
components. I comment briefly on the RHESSI observation of polarization in the
gamma-ray burst GRB0212206. I argue that this polarization is consistent with a
tangled field, and does not require a large-scale organized field. Finally I
suggest that the role of magnetic fields in creating jets, as described here,
should be understood not to work within the confines of magnetocentrifugal
models of jets, but rather as an alternative to them.",2005-06-09T17:10:57Z
Discovery of a Nearly Edge-On Disk Around HD 32297,"We report the discovery of a nearly edge-on disk about the A0 star HD 32297
seen in light scattered by the disk grains revealed in NICMOS PSF-subtracted
coronagraphic images. The disk extends to a distance of at least 400 AU (3.3"")
along its major axis with a 1.1 micron flux density of 4.81 +/-0.57 mJy beyond
a radius of 0.3"" from the coronagraphically occulted star. The fraction of 1.1
micron starlight scattered by the disk, 0.0033 +/- 0.0004, is comparable to its
fractional excess emission at 25 + 60 micron of ~ 0.0027 as measured from IRAS
data. The disk appears to be inclined 10.5 degrees +/- 2.5 degrees from an
edge-on viewing geometry, with its major axis oriented 236.5 degrees +/- 1
degree eastward of north. The disk exhibits unequal brightness in opposing
sides and a break in the surface brightness profile along NE-side disk major
axis. Such asymmetries might implicate the existence of one or more (unseen)
planetary mass companions.",2005-07-14T17:33:25Z
The near-IR luminosity-metallicity relation of dwarf irregular galaxies,"We report on the recent developments of our long-term investigation of the
near-IR luminosity-metallicity relation for dwarf irregular galaxies in nearby
groups. A very well-defined relation is emerging from our observational
database, and a preliminary discussion of its implications is given.",2005-05-17T17:32:34Z
The dynamical disconnection of sunspots from their magnetic roots,"After a dynamically active emergence phase, magnetic flux at the solar
surface soon ceases to show strong signs of the subsurface dynamics of its
parent magnetic structure. This indicates that some kind of disconnection of
the emerged flux from its roots in the deep convection zone should take place.
We propose a mechanism for the dynamical disconnection of the surface flux
based upon the buoyant upflow of plasma along the field lines. Such flows arise
in the upper part of a rising flux loop during the final phases of its buoyant
ascent towards the surface. The combination of the pressure buildup by the
upflow and the cooling of the upper layers of an emerged flux tube by radiative
losses at the surface lead to a progressive weakening of the magnetic field in
several Mm depth. When the field strength has become sufficiently low,
convective motions and the fluting instability disrupt the flux tube into thin,
passively advected flux fragments, thus providing a dynamical disconnection of
the emerged part from its roots. We substantiate this scenario by considering
the quasi-static evolution of a sunspot model under the effects of radiative
cooling, convective energy transport, and pressure buildup by a prescribed
inflow at the bottom of the model. For inflow speeds in the range shown by
simulations of thin flux tubes, we find that the disconnection takes place in a
depth between 2 and 6 Mm for disconnection times up to 3 days.",2005-06-27T16:24:50Z
"The Low Excitation Planetary Nebulae HuDo 1 and HuBi 1 and their [WC10]
  Central Stars","Low- and high-resolution spectra of the planetary nebulae HuDo 1 and HuBi 1,
around [WC-late] stars, are analyzed. The objects belong to the galactic disk,
with heliocentric radial velocities of -12 km/s (HuDo 1) and 57 km/s (HuBi 1).
  C(Hbeta) reddening values are of 2.04 for HuDo 1 and 1.22 for HuBi 1. Plasma
line ratios are used to estimate physical conditions and abundances. We find
log (O/H)+12 = 8.43 and 8.57, and N/O = 0.2 and 0.1 for HuDo 1 and HuBi 1
respectively. HuBi 1 is the only PN excited by a very late [WC] star showing
intense nebular HeI recombination lines. From the stellar lines we derive a [WC
10] type for both stars, although HuBi 1 central star should be slightly hotter
for providing a large amount of He^0 ionizing photons. Nebular and stellar
parameters of HuDo 1 and HuBi 1 are compared with those of other [WC 10]
objects, concluding that the stars of HuDo 1 and HuBi 1 should be intrinsically
fainter. In particular HuBi 1 seems a low-density evolved nebula around a
low-mass slowly-evolving star.",2005-06-17T21:15:00Z
"The Reionization History and Early Metal Enrichment inferred from the
  Gamma-Ray Burst Rate","Based on the gamma-ray burst (GRB) event rate at redshifts of $4 \leq z \leq
12$, which is assessed by the spectral peak energy-to-luminosity relation
recently found by Yonetoku et al., we observationally derive the star formation
rate (SFR) for Pop III stars in a high redshift universe. As a result, we find
that Pop III stars could form continuously at $4 \leq z \leq 12$. Using the
derived Pop III SFR, we attempt to estimate the ultraviolet (UV) photon
emission rate at $7 \leq z \leq 12$ in which redshift range no observational
information has been hitherto obtained on ionizing radiation intensity. We find
that the UV emissivity at $7 \leq z \leq 12$ can make a noticeable contribution
to the early reionization. The maximal emissivity is higher than the level
required to keep ionizing the intergalactic matter at $7 \leq z \leq 12$.
However, if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from Pop III objects is
smaller than 10%, then the IGM can be neutralized at some redshift, which may
lead to the double reionization. As for the enrichment, the ejection of all
metals synthesized in Pop III objects is marginally consistent with the IGM
metallicity, although the confinement of metals in Pop III objects can reduce
the enrichment significantly.",2005-04-15T12:49:49Z
"GRB 050509b: the elusive optical/nIR/mm afterglow of a short-duration
  GRB","We present multiwavelength (optical/near infrared/millimetre) observations of
a short duration gamma-ray burst detected by Swift (GRB 050509b) collected
between 0 seconds and ~18.8 days after the event. No optical, near infrared or
millimetre emission has been detected in spite of the well localised X-ray
afterglow, confirming the elusiveness of the short duration events. We also
discuss the possibility of the burst being located in a cluster of galaxies at
z= 0.225 or beyond. In the former case, the spectral energy distribution of the
neighbouring, potential host galaxy, favours a system harbouring an evolved
dominant stellar population (age ~360 Myr), unlike most long duration GRB host
galaxies observed so far, i.e. thus giving support to a compact binary merger
origin. Any underlying supernova that could be associated with this particular
event should have been at least 3 magnitudes fainter than the type Ib/c SN
1998bw and 2.3 magnitudes fainter than a typical type Ia SN.",2005-06-27T20:00:36Z
Integral Field Spectroscopy of 23 Spiral Bulges,"We have obtained Integral Field Spectroscopy for 23 spiral bulges using
INTEGRAL on the William Herschel Telescope and SPIRAL on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope. This is the first 2D survey directed solely at the bulges of spiral
galaxies. Eleven galaxies of the sample do not have previous measurements of
the stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*). These data are designed to complement
our Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph program for estimating black hole
masses in the range 10^6-10^8M_sun using gas kinematics from nucleated disks.
These observations will serve to derive the stellar dynamical bulge properties
using the traditional Mgb and CaII triplets. We use both Cross Correlation and
Maximum Penalized Likelihood to determine projected sigma* in these systems and
present radial velocity fields, major axis rotation curves, curves of growth
and sigma* fields. Using the Cross Correlation to extract the low order 2D
stellar dynamics we generally see coherent radial rotation and irregular
velocity dispersion fields suggesting that sigma* is a non-trivial parameter to
estimate.",2005-04-29T12:57:55Z
The Role of Magnetic Fields on Astrophysical Jets,"Highly collimated supersonic jets and less collimated outflows are observed
to emerge from a wide variety of astrophysical objects. They are seen in young
stellar objects (YSOs), proto-planetary nebulae, compact objects (such as
galactic black holes or microquasars, and X-ray binary stars), and in the
nuclei of active galaxies (AGNs). Despite their different physical scales (in
size, velocity, and amount of energy transported), they have strong
morphological similarities. What is the universal mechanism that can explain
their origin? In this lecture, I briefly review the role that magnetic fields
seem to play on the formation, structure, and propagation of these jets.",2005-05-25T22:19:50Z
"Binary Encounters With Supermassive Black Holes: Zero-Eccentricity LISA
  Events","Current simulations of the rate at which stellar-mass compact objects merge
with supermassive black holes (called extreme mass ratio inspirals, or EMRIs)
focus on two-body capture by emission of gravitational radiation. The
gravitational wave signal of such events will likely involve a significant
eccentricity in the sensitivity range of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA). We show that tidal separation of stellar-mass compact object binaries
by supermassive black holes will instead produce events whose eccentricity is
nearly zero in the LISA band. Compared to two-body capture events, tidal
separations have a high cross section and result in orbits that have a large
pericenter and small apocenter. Therefore, the rate of interactions per binary
is high and the resulting systems are very unlikely to be perturbed by other
stars into nearly radial plunges. Depending on the fraction of compact objects
that are in binaries within a few parsecs of the center, the rate of
low-eccentricity LISA events could be comparable to or larger than the rate of
high-eccentricity events.",2005-07-06T17:35:52Z
"Detection and imaging of atmospheric radio flashes from cosmic ray air
  showers","The nature of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies >10^20 eV
remains a mystery. They are likely to be of extragalactic origin, but should be
absorbed within ~50 Mpc through interactions with the cosmic microwave
background. As there are no sufficient powerful accelerators within this
distance from the Galaxy, explanations for UHECRs range from unusual
astrophysical sources to exotic string physics. Also unclear is whether UHECRs
consist of protons, heavy nuclei, neutrinos or gamma-rays. To resolve these
questions, larger detectors with higher duty cycles and which combine multiple
detection techniques are needed. Radio emission from UHECRs, on the other hand,
is unaffected by attenuation, has a high duty cycle, gives calorimetric
measurements and provides high directional accuracy. Here we report the
detection of radio flashes from cosmic-ray air showers using low-cost digital
radio receivers. We show that the radiation can be understood in terms of the
geosynchrotron effect. Our results show that it should be possible to determine
the nature and composition of UHECRs with combined radio and particle
detectors, and to detect the ultrahigh-energy neutrinos expected from flavour
mixing.",2005-05-18T17:20:35Z
Robust Reconstruction from Chopped and Nodded Images,"In ground based infrared imaging a well-known technique to reduce the
influence of thermal and background noise is chopping and nodding, where four
different signals of the same object are recorded from which the object is
reconstructed numerically. Since noise in the data can severely affect the
reconstruction, regularization algorithms have to be implemented. In this paper
we propose to combine iterative reconstruction algorithms with robust
statistical methods. Moreover, we study the use of multiple chopped data sets
with different chopping amplitudes and the according numerical reconstruction
algorithm. Numerical simulations show robustness of the proposed methods with
respect to noisy data.",2005-08-08T09:46:57Z
A simple model for the evolution of disc galaxies: The Milky Way,"A simple model for the evolution of disc galaxies is presented. We adopt
three numbers from observations of the Milky Way disc, the local surface mass
density, the stellar scale length (of the assumedly exponential disc) and the
amplitude of the (assumedly flat) rotation curve, and physically, the (local)
dynamical Kennicutt star formation prescription, standard chemical evolution
equations assuming and a model for spectral evolution of stellar populations.
We can determine the detailed evolution of the model with only the addition of
standard cosmological scalings with time of the dimensional parameters. A
surprising wealth of detailed specifications follows from this prescription
including the gaseous infall rate as a function of radius and time, the
distribution of stellar ages and metallicities with time and radius, surface
brightness profiles at different wavelengths, colours etc. At the solar
neighbourhood stars start to form $\approx 10 Gyrs$ ago at an increasing rate
peaking 4 billion years ago and then slowly declining in good agreement with
observations. The mean age of long lived stars at the solar neighbourhood is
about $4 Gyrs$. The local surface density of the stars and gas are 35 and $15
M_{\odot}pc^{-2}$, respectively. The metallicity distribution of the stars at
the solar radius is narrow with a peak at $[Z/Z_{\odot}] = -0.1$.Both a
Salpeter IMF and a Chabrier IMF are consistent with observations. Comparisons
with the current and local fossil evidence provides support for the model which
can then be used to assess other local disc galaxies, the evolution of disc
galaxies in deep optical surveys and also for theoretical investigations such
as simulations of merging disc galaxies (abbreviated).",2005-05-30T10:26:12Z
Possible hot spots excited by the relativistic jets of Cygnus X-3,"We present the results of a deep search for associated radio features in the
vicinity of the microquasar Cygnus X-3. The motivation behind is to find out
evidence for interaction between its relativistic jets and the surrounding
interstellar medium, which could eventually allow us to perform calorimetry of
the total energy released by this microquasar during its flaring lifetime.
Remarkably, two radio sources with mJy emission level at centimeter wavelengths
have been detected in excellent alignment with the position angle of the inner
radio jets. We propose that these objects could be the hot spots where the
relativitic outflow collides with the ambient gas in analogy with
Fanaroff-Riley II radio galaxies. These candidate hot spots are within a few
arc-minutes of Cygnus X-3 and, if physically related, the full linear extent of
the jet would reach tens of parsecs. We discuss here the evidence currently
available to support this hypothesis based on both archival data and our own
observations.",2005-05-20T09:29:19Z
"Pulse-phase spectroscopy of SMC X-1 with Chandra and XMM-Newton:
  reprocessing by a precessing disk?","We present pulse-phase X-ray spectroscopy of the high-mass X-ray pulsar SMC
X-1 from five different epochs, using Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-S and
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data. The X-ray spectrum consistently shows two distinct
components, a hard power law and a soft blackbody with kT_BB ~ 0.18 keV. For
all five epochs the hard component shows a simple double-peaked pulse shape,
and also a variation in the power law slope, which becomes harder at maximum
flux and softer at minimum flux. For the soft component, the pulse profile
changes between epochs, in both shape and phase relative to the power law
pulses. The soft component is likely produced by reprocessing of the hard X-ray
pulsar beam by the inner accretion disk. We use a model of a twisted inner
disk, illuminated by the rotating X-ray pulsar beam, to simulate pulsations in
the soft component due to this reprocessing. We find that for some disk and
beam geometries, precession of an illuminated accretion disk can roughly
reproduce the observed long-term changes in the soft pulse profiles.",2005-06-18T18:48:00Z
Is the Cepheus E Outflow driven by a Class 0 Protostar?,"New early release observations of the Cepheus E outflow and its embedded
source, obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, are presented. We show the
driving source is detected in all 4 IRAC bands, which suggests that traditional
Class 0 classification, although essentially correct, needs to accommodate the
new high sensitivity infrared arrays and their ability to detected deeply
embedded sources. The IRAC, MIPS 24 and 70 microns new photometric points are
consistent with a spectral energy distribution dominated by a cold, dense
envelope surrounding the protostar. The Cep E outflow, unlike its more famous
cousin the HH 46/47 outflow, displays a very similar morphology in the near and
mid-infrared wavelengths, and is detected at 24 microns. The interface between
the dense molecular gas (where Cep E lies) and less dense interstellar medium,
is well traced by the emission at 8 and 24 microns, and is one of the most
exotic features of the new IRAC and MIPS images. IRS observations of the North
lobe of the flow confirm that most of the emission is due to the excitation of
pure H2 rotational transitions arising from a relatively cold (Tex~700 K) and
dense (N{H}~9.6E20 cm-2 molecular gas.",2005-06-28T22:46:57Z
GRACOS: Scalable and Load Balanced P3M Cosmological N-body Code,"We present a parallel implementation of the particle-particle/particle-mesh
(P3M) algorithm for distributed memory clusters. The GRACOS (GRAvitational
COSmology) code uses a hybrid method for both computation and domain
decomposition. Long-range forces are computed using a Fourier transform gravity
solver on a regular mesh; the mesh is distributed across parallel processes
using a static one-dimensional slab domain decomposition. Short-range forces
are computed by direct summation of close pairs; particles are distributed
using a dynamic domain decomposition based on a space-filling Hilbert curve. A
nearly-optimal method was devised to dynamically repartition the particle
distribution so as to maintain load balance even for extremely inhomogeneous
mass distributions. Tests using $800^3$ simulations on a 40-processor beowulf
cluster showed good load balance and scalability up to 80 processes. We discuss
the limits on scalability imposed by communication and extreme clustering and
suggest how they may be removed by extending our algorithm to include adaptive
mesh refinement.",2005-05-05T16:37:21Z
"Infrared Properties of Star Forming Dwarf Galaxies: I. Dwarf Irregular
  Galaxies in the Local Volume","A sample of 34 dwarf irregular galaxies in the Local Volume, most nearer than
5 Mpc, has been imaged in the near-infrared (NIR) in J and K_s at CFHT in
Hawaii and OAN-SPM in Mexico. In CFHT images, stars brighter than M_Ks=-7.5
were resolved. In most cases, the resolved population represents less than 5%
of the total NIR flux in K_s. Although exponential at large radii, surface
brightness profiles for the unresolved component flatten in the centres. They
can be fitted across the whole range of radii with a hyperbolic secant (sech)
defined as a function of two parameters: the central surface brightness and the
scale length of the exponential. Isophotal, total, and fitted sech magnitudes
have been calculated for all galaxies for which the unresolved component was
detected, along with semimajor axes. The scale length and the semimajor axes
correlate linearly with absolute isophotal magnitude. The same is true for
colors and the central brightness. More luminous dIs tend to be larger, redder
and brighter in the centre. The Tully-Fisher relation shows considerable
scatter, but residuals are tied to surface brightness. The galaxies appear to
lie in a ``fundamental plane'' defined by the sech absolute magnitude, the sech
central surface brightness, and the HI line-width. The rms of residuals in M_K
is only 0.4 mag, which implies that the plane can be used to evaluate the
distances of star-forming dwarfs. Color-magnitude diagrams are presented for 29
galaxies in which stars were resolved. Most show a finger centered around
J-K_s=1 mag. In some cases, there is a red tail extending to J-K_s=2.5 mag.

Astrophysical bounds on supersymmetric dark-matter Q-balls,"Stable baryonic Q-balls, which appear in supersymmetric extensions of the
Standard Model, could form at the end of cosmological inflation from
fragmentation of the Affleck -- Dine condensate. We reconsider astrophysical
constraints on such Q-balls as dark matter candidates. Baryonic Q-balls
interact with matter by absorbing the baryon number and, effectively, leading
to a rapid baryon number non-conservation. We have recently shown that this
process can occur at a much faster rate than that used in previous
calculations. As a consequence, stability of neutron stars imposes a stringent
constraint on the types of Q-balls that can be dark matter. Only the Q-balls
that correspond to baryonic flat directions lifted by baryon-number violating
operators are allowed as dark-matter candidates.",2005-07-09T00:38:02Z
"HD 172189: An eclipsing and spectroscopic binary with a Delta Sct-ttype
  pulsating component in an open cluster","We present a study based on more than 2500 uvby-measurements collected on HD
172189, a new eclipsing binary system with a Delta Sct-type pulsating component
that belongs to the open cluster IC 4756. The great interest of this object
lies in that three important characteristics coexist: cluster membership,
binarity and pulsation. Its binarity and the Delta Sct-type pulsations of one
component were detected in the course of several Stromgren photometric
campaigns. The frequency analysis of all the uvby out-of-eclipse data reveals a
clear frequency of 19.5974 c/d as well as the existence of other high values in
the range 18-20 c/d. We have also carried out a first evaluation of the binary
parameters and determined a value of 5.702 d for the orbital period. An
additional potential interest of HD 172189 resides in its location in the field
of view of the COROT mission and, therefore, this star is an excellent
candidate for becoming a target for asteroseismology.",2005-06-03T11:10:18Z
"Time scales of Li evolution: a homogeneous analysis of open clusters
  from ZAMS to late-MS","We have performed a new and homogeneous analysis of all the Li data available
in the literature for main sequence stars (spectral-types from late F to K) in
open clusters. In the present paper we focus on a detailed investigation of MS
Li depletion and its time scales for stars in the 6350-5500 K effective
temperature range. For the first time, we were able to constrain the age at
which non-standard mixing processes, driving MS Li depletion, appear. We have
also shown that MS Li depletion is not a continuous process and cannot be
simply described by a t^(-alpha) law. We confirm that depletion becomes
ineffective beyond an age of 1-2 Gyr for the majority of the stars, leading to
a Li plateau at old ages. We compared the empirical scenario of Li as a
function of age with the predictions of three non-standard models. We found
that models including only gravity waves as main mixing process are not able to
fit the Li vs. age pattern and thus this kind of mixing can be excluded as the
predominant mechanism responsible for Li depletion. On the other hand, models
including slow mixing induced by rotation and angular momentum loss, and in
particular those including also diffusive processes not related to rotation,
can explain to some extent the empirical evidence. However, none of the
currently proposed models can fit the plateau at old ages.",2005-07-22T14:18:01Z
"Numerical 3+1 general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics: a local
  characteristic approach","We present a general procedure to solve numerically the general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) equations within the framework of the 3+1
formalism. The work reported here extends our previous investigation in general
relativistic hydrodynamics (Banyuls et al. 1997) where magnetic fields were not
considered. The GRMHD equations are written in conservative form to exploit
their hyperbolic character in the solution procedure. All theoretical
ingredients necessary to build up high-resolution shock-capturing schemes based
on the solution of local Riemann problems (i.e. Godunov-type schemes) are
described. In particular, we use a renormalized set of regular eigenvectors of
the flux Jacobians of the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations. In
addition, the paper describes a procedure based on the equivalence principle of
general relativity that allows the use of Riemann solvers designed for special
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in GRMHD. Our formulation and numerical
methodology are assessed by performing various test simulations recently
considered by different authors. These include magnetized shock tubes,
spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, equatorial accretion onto
a Kerr black hole, and magnetized thick accretion disks around a black hole
prone to the magnetorotational instability.",2005-06-02T16:04:46Z
"On the nature of Lithium-rich giant stars: constraints from Beryllium
  abundances","We have derived beryllium abundances for 7 Li-rich giant (A(Li) > 1.5) stars
and 10 other Li-normal giants, with the aim of investigating the origin of the
Lithium in the Li-rich giants. In particular, we test the predictions of the
engulfment scenario proposed by Siess & Livio (1999), where the engulfment of a
brown dwarf or one or more giant planets would lead to a simultaneous
enrichment of 7Li and 9Be. We show that regardless their nature, none of the
stars studied in this paper were found to have detectable beryllium. Using
simple dilution arguments we show that the engulfment of an external object as
the sole source of Li enrichment is ruled out by the Li and Be abundance data.
The present results favor the idea that Li has been produced in the interior of
the stars by a Cameron-Fowler process and brought up to the surface by an extra
mixing mechanism.",2005-04-06T00:31:48Z
"Ionization States and Plasma Structures of Mixed-morphology SNRs
  Observed with ASCA","We present the results of a systematic study using ASCA of the ionization
state for six ``mixed-morphology'' supernova emnants (MMSNRs): IC 443, W49B,
W28, W44, 3C391, and Kes 27. MMSNRs show centrally filled thermal X-ray
emission, which contrasts to shell-like radio morphology, a set of
haracteristics at odds with the standard model of SNR evolution (e.g., the
Sedov model). We have therefore studied the evolution of the MMSNRs from the
ionization conditions inferred from the X-ray spectra, independent of X-ray
morphology. We find highly ionized plasmas approaching ionization equilibrium
in all the mmsnrs. The degree of ionization is systematically higher than the
plasma usually seen in shell-like SNRs. Radial temperature gradients are also
observed in five remnants, with cooler plasma toward the limb. In IC 443 and
W49B, we find a plasma structure consistent with shell-like SNRs, suggesting
that at least some MMSNRs have experienced similar evolution to shell-like
SNRs. In addition to the results above, we have discovered an ``overionized''
ionization state in W49B, in addition to that previously found in IC 443.
Thermal conduction can cause the hot interior plasma to become overionized by
reducing the temperature and density gradients, leading to an interior density
increase and temperature decrease. Therefore, we suggest that the
``center-filled'' X-ray morphology develops as the result of thermal
conduction, and should arise in all SNRs. This is consistent with the results
that MMSNRs are near collisional ionization equilibrium since the conduction
timescale is roughly similar to the ionization timescale. Hence, we conclude
that MMSNRs are those that have evolved over$\sim10^4$ yr. We call this phase
as the ``conduction phase.''",2005-07-14T14:52:21Z
"Galactic Gradients, Postbiological Evolution and the Apparent Failure of
  SETI","Motivated by recent developments impacting our view of Fermi's paradox
(absence of extraterrestrials and their manifestations from our past light
cone), we suggest a reassessment of the problem itself, as well as of
strategies employed by SETI projects so far. The need for such reevaluation is
fueled not only by the failure of searches thus far, but also by great advances
recently made in astrophysics, astrobiology, computer science and future
studies, which have remained largely ignored in SETI practice. As an example of
the new approach, we consider the effects of the observed metallicity and
temperature gradients in the Milky Way on the spatial distribution of
hypothetical advanced extraterrestrial intelligent communities. While,
obviously, properties of such communities and their sociological and
technological preferences are entirely unknown, we assume that (1) they operate
in agreement with the known laws of physics, and (2) that at some point they
typically become motivated by a meta-principle embodying the central role of
information-processing; a prototype of the latter is the recently suggested
Intelligence Principle of Steven J. Dick. There are specific conclusions of
practical interest to be drawn from coupling of these reasonable assumptions
with the astrophysical and astrochemical structure of the Galaxy. In
particular, we suggest that the outer regions of the Galactic disk are most
likely locations for advanced SETI targets, and that intelligent communities
will tend to migrate outward through the Galaxy as their capacities of
information-processing increase, for both thermodynamical and astrochemical
reasons. This can also be regarded as a possible generalization of the Galactic
Habitable Zone, concept currently much investigated in astrobiology.",2005-06-06T14:10:44Z
Detection of Near-IR CO Absorption Bands in R Coronae Borealis Stars,"R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich pulsating
post-AGB stars that experience massive irregular declines in brightness caused
by circumstellar dust formation. The mechanism of dust formation around RCB
stars is not well understood. It has been proposed that CO molecules play an
important role in cooling the circumstellar gas so that dust may form. We
report on a survey for CO in a sample of RCB stars. We obtained H- and K-band
spectra including the first and second overtone CO bands for eight RCB stars,
the RCB-like star, DY Per and the final-helium-flash star, FG Sge. The first
and second overtone CO bands were detected in the cooler (T(eff)<6000 K) RCB
stars, Z Umi, ES Aql, SV Sge and DY Per. The bands are not present in the
warmer (T(eff)>6000 K) RCB stars, R CrB, RY Sgr, SU Tau, XX Cam. In addition,
first overtone bands are seen in FG Sge, a final-helium-flash star that is in
an RCB-like phase at present. Effective temperatures of the eight RCB stars
range from 4000 to 7250 K. The observed photospheric CO absorption bands were
compared to line-blanketed model spectra of RCB stars. As predicted by the
models, the CO bands are strongest in the coolest RCB stars and not present in
the warmest. No correlation was found between the presence or strength of the
CO bands and dust formation activity in the stars.",2005-03-23T14:30:50Z
The recurrent ultra-luminous X-ray transient NGC 253 ULX1,"We present the results of ROSAT and XMM-Newton observations of the recurrent
ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 253 ULX1. This transient is one of the few
ULXs that was detected during several outbursts. The luminosity reached 1.4
10^39 erg s^-1 and 0.5 10^39 erg s^-1 in the detections by ROSAT and
XMM-Newton, respectively, indicating a black hole X-ray binary with a mass of
the compact object of >11 M_sun. It is highly unlikely that this source is a
foreground source or a background AGN. In the ROSAT detection NGC 253 ULX1
showed significant variability, whereas the luminosity was constant in the
detection from XMM-Newton. The XMM-Newton EPIC spectra are well-fit by a
bremsstrahlung model (kT=2.24 keV, N_H=1.74 10^20 cm^-2), which can be used to
describe a comptonized plasma. No counterpart was detected in the optical I, R,
B, NUV and FUV bands to limits of 22.9, 24.2, 24.3, 22 and 23 mag,
respectively, pointing at a X-ray binary with a low mass companion.",2005-07-11T11:42:50Z
Iron Needles in Supernova Remnants?,"It has been suggested by Dwek (2004) that iron needles could explain the
submillimetre emission from the Cas A supernova remnant (SNR) with only a very
small total mass. We investigate whether a similar model holds for the Kepler
supernova remnant, and find that its emission could indeed be explained by a
dust mass of less than 10^-2 M_sun dependent on the axial ratio (l/a) of the
needles - which we constrain to be less than 700. But the implied needle model
for Kepler is inconsistent with that suggested for Cas A since either the
needles would have to have a resistivity one or two orders of magnitude greater
than those in Cas A or the electron density in Kepler's shocked plasma must be
40 times greater than suggested by X-ray observations. An additional problem
with the needle model is that the implied thickness of the needles seems to be
implausibly small, if the emission properties are calculated under the usual
approximations.",2005-05-27T15:00:07Z
"The Evolutionary Status of Be Stars: Results from a Photometric Study of
  Southern Open Clusters","Be stars are a class of rapidly rotating B stars with circumstellar disks
that cause Balmer and other line emission. There are three possible reasons for
the rapid rotation of Be stars: they may have been born as rapid rotators, spun
up by binary mass transfer, or spun up during the main-sequence (MS) evolution
of B stars. To test the various formation scenarios, we have conducted a
photometric survey of 55 open clusters in the southern sky. Of these, five
clusters are probably not physically associated groups and our results for two
other clusters are not reliable, but we identify 52 definite Be stars and an
additional 129 Be candidates in the remaining clusters. We use our results to
examine the age and evolutionary dependence of the Be phenomenon. We find an
overall increase in the fraction of Be stars with age until 100 Myr, and Be
stars are most common among the brightest, most massive B-type stars above the
zero-age MS (ZAMS). We show that a spin-up phase at the terminal-age MS (TAMS)
cannot produce the observed distribution of Be stars, but up to 73% of the Be
stars detected may have been spun-up by binary mass transfer. Most of the
remaining Be stars were likely rapid rotators at birth.
  Previous studies have suggested that low metallicity and high cluster density
may also favor Be star formation. Our results indicate a possible increase in
the fraction of Be stars with increasing cluster distance from the Galactic
center (in environments of decreasing metallicity). However, the trend is not
significant and could be ruled out due to the intrinsic scatter in our data. We
also find no relationship between the fraction of Be stars and cluster density.",2005-05-02T18:52:53Z
"Steps towards a solution of the FS Aurigae puzzle. I. Multicolour
  high-speed photometry with ULTRACAM","We present the analysis of high-speed photometric observations of FS Aur
taken with the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope and the high-speed camera
ULTRACAM in late 2003. These observations were intended to determine whether
there was any evidence of photometric variability with a period in the range
50-100 seconds. The discovery of such variations would help to explain
existence, in FS Aur, of the very coherent photometric period of 205.5 min that
exceeds the spectroscopic period by 2.4 times. Such a discrepancy in the
photometric and spectroscopic periods is an unusual for a low mass binary
system that is unambiguously identified as a Cataclysmic Variable. Using
various methods, including wavelet-analysis, we found that with exception of
the 205.5-minute periodicity, the main characteristic of variability of FS Aur
is usual flickering and Quasi-Periodic Oscillations. However, we detected
variability with a period of ~101 and/or ~105 sec, seen for a short time every
half of the orbital period. These oscillations may be associated with the spin
period of the white dwarf, not ruling out the possibility that we are observing
a precessing rapidly rotating white dwarf in FS Aur.",2005-07-16T14:36:38Z
"Chandra Detection of the First X-ray Forest along the Line of Sight To
  Mkn 421","We present the first >=3.5 sigma (conservative) or >=5.8 sigma (sum of lines
significance) detection of two Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) filaments
at z>0, which we find along the line of sight to the blazar Mkn 421. These
systems are detected through highly ionized resonant metal absorption in high
quality Chandra-ACIS and -HRC Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) spectra of
Mkn 421, obtained following our two Target of Opportunity requests during two
outburst phases.
  The two intervening WHIM systems that we detect, have OVII and NVII columns
of N(OVII)=(1.0 +/- 0.3) x 1e15 cm-2} N(NVII)=(0.8 +/- 0.4) x 1e15 cm-2, and
N(OVII)=(0.7 +/- 0.3) x 1e15 cm-2, N(NVII)=(1.4 +/- 0.5) x 1e15 cm-2
respectively.
  From the detected number of WHIM filaments along this line of sight we can
estimate the number of OVII filaments per unit redshift with columns larger
than 7e14 cm-2, dP(OVII)/dz(N(OVII)>=7e14) = 67^{+88}_{-43}, consistent, within
the large 1-sigma errors, with the hydrodynamical simulation predictions of
dP(OVII)/dz(N(OVII)>=7e14) = 30. Finally, we measure a cosmological mass
density of X-ray WHIM filaments Omega_b = 0.027^{+0.038}_{-0.019} x
10^{[O/H]_{-1}}, consistent with both model predictions and the estimated
number of 'missing' baryons at low redshift.",2005-04-07T18:37:31Z
"Statistics of Magnification Perturbations by Substructure in the Cold
  Dark Matter Cosmological Model","We study the statistical properties of magnification perturbations by
substructures in strong lensed systems using linear perturbation theory and an
analytical substructure model including tidal truncation and a continuous
substructure mass spectrum. We demonstrate that magnification perturbations are
dominated by perturbers found within a tidal radius of an image, and that
sizable magnification perturbations may arise from small, coherent
contributions from several substructures within the lens halo. We find that the
root-mean-square (rms) fluctuation of the magnification perturbation is 10% to
20% and both the average and rms perturbations are sensitive to the mass
spectrum and density profile of the perturbers. Interestingly, we find that
relative to a smooth model of the same mass, the average magnification in
clumpy models is lower (higher) than that in smooth models for positive
(negative) parity images. This is opposite from what is observed if one assumes
that the image magnification predicted by the best-fit smooth model of a lens
is a good proxy for what the observed magnification would have been if
substructures were absent. While it is possible for this discrepancy to be
resolved via nonlinear perturbers, we argue that a more likely explanation is
that the assumption that the best-fit lens model is a good proxy for the
magnification in the absence of substructure is not correct. We conclude that a
better theoretical understanding of the predicted statistical properties of
magnification perturbations by CDM substructure is needed in order to affirm
that CDM substructures have been unambiguously detected.",2005-06-23T20:39:19Z
"Neutron Star Superfluidity, Dynamics and Precession","Basic rotational and magnetic properties of neutron superfluids and proton
superconductors in neutron stars are reviewed. The modes of precession of the
neutron superfluid are discussed in detail. We emphasize that at finite
temperature, pinning of superfluid vortices does not offer any constraint on
the precession. Any pinning energies can be surmounted by thermal activation
and there exists a dynamical steady state in which the superfluid follows the
precession of the crust at a small lag angle between the crust and superfluid
rotation velocity vectors. At this small lag the system is far from the
critical conditions for unpinning, even if the observed precession of the crust
may entail a large angle between the figure axis and the crust's rotation
velocity vector. We conclude that if long period modulations of pulse arrival
times and pulse shapes observed in a pulsar like the PSR B1828-11 are due to
the precession of the neutron star, this does not have any binding implications
about the existence of pinning by flux lines or the existence of Type II
superconductivity in the neutron star.",2005-05-04T14:58:35Z
Optical Constraints on an X-ray Transient Source in M31,"We have detected a transient X-ray source in the M31 bulge through a
continuing monitoring campaign with the Chandra ACIS-I camera. The source was
detected at R.A.=00:42:33.428 +/- 0.11'', Dec.=+41:17:03.37 +/- 0.11'' in only
a single observation taken 2004 May 23. Fortuitous optical HST/ACS imaging of
the transient location prior to the X-ray outburst, along with follow-up
HST/ACS imaging during and after the outburst, reveals no transient optical
source brighter than B (equivalent) = 25.5. The location of the source and its
X-ray properties suggest it is a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Assuming the
transient is similar to many Galactic X-ray novae, the X-ray luminosity of (3.9
+/- 0.5) X 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the upper-limit on the optical luminosity
provide a prediction of <1.6 days for the orbital period of the binary system.",2005-06-14T15:58:33Z
Rapid Growth of Black Holes in Massive Star-Forming Galaxies,"The tight relationship between the masses of black holes and galaxy spheroids
in nearby galaxies implies a causal connection between the growth of these two
components. Optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting black
holes in the Universe and can account for >30% of the total cosmological
black-hole growth. As typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense star
formation and already host massive black holes [>10^(8) M(Sun)], there must
have been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew [mass range
  ~10^(6)-10^(8) M(Sun)]. The likely signature of this earlier stage is
simultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (i.e., z>1; >8
billion light years away) luminous galaxies. Here we report ultra-deep X-ray
observations of distant star-forming galaxies that are bright at submillimetre
wavelengths. We find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almost
continuously throughout periods of intense star formation. This activity
appears to be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coeval
galaxy populations. We show that the black-hole growth from these galaxies is
consistent with that expected for the pre-quasar phase.",2005-03-21T21:12:46Z
"Hydrodynamic Simulations of A Moving Substructure in A Cluster of
  Galaxies: Cold Fronts and Turbulence Generation","We perform three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a moving
substructure in a cluster of galaxies. We investigate dynamical evolution of
the intracluster medium (ICM) in and around the substructure moving radially in
the larger cluster's gravitational potential, and its observational
consequences. After the substructure passes the larger cluster's center, a bow
shock and clear contact discontinuity form in front of it. The contact
discontinuity looks like a sharp cold front in the X-ray image synthesized from
the simulation results. This agrees with a structure found in 1E 0657-56. The
flow structure remains laminar before the first turnaround because the
ram-pressure stripping is dominant over the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities on the boundary between the substructure and the ambient ICM.
  When a subcluster oscillates radially around the larger cluster's center,
both Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop well and the
flow structure becomes highly turbulent. Around the turnaround, the
subcluster's cold gas is pushed out of its potential well.
  Therefore, the cold gas component appears to be in front of the subcluster. A
relatively blunt cold front appears in the simulated
  X-ray image because the contact discontinuity is perturbed by Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities. This can explain the ICM structure found in A168.",2005-05-13T05:14:59Z
"X-ray States of Black-Hole Binaries and Implications for the Mechanism
  of Steady Jets","The three X-ray states of active accretion in black-hole binaries have been
re-defined to focus attention on different physical elements that may
contribute radiation: the accretion disk, a jet, and a compact and radio-quiet
corona. Examples of state evolution are displayed on a time line, and on a
hardness-intensity diagram. The latter format allows a synthesis of these
states with the ``unified model for black hole binary jets'' by Fender,
Belloni, & Gallo (2004). As suggested by Corbel (2004), the ``jet line''
appears to coincide with the hard limit of the SPL state. In GX339-4, the broad
power peaks in the PDS are confined to intermediate and hard states, where a
jet is present. This suggests that these Fourier components are temporal
signatures of non-thermal processes related to the jet mechanism, rather than
properties inherent to a standard accretion disk.",2005-04-05T22:45:31Z
Primary Energy Spectra and Elemental Composition. GAMMA Experiment,"On the basis of the Extensive Air Shower data observed by the GAMMA

rays have been derived in the 1-100 PeV energy range. Reconstruction of the
primary energy spectra is carried out in the framework of the SIBYLL and QGSJET
interaction models and the hypothesis of the power-law steepening primary

"Signature of Galactic Outflows as Absorption-Free Gaps in the Ly-alpha
  Forest","Powerful outflows from star-forming galaxies are expected to push away the
neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) around those galaxies, and produce
absorption-free gaps in the Ly-alpha forest. We analyze the abundance of gaps
of various sizes in three high resolution spectra of quasars at z ~ 3 - 3.5.
The gap statistics agrees well with a model in which galactic halos above a
minimum mass scale of M_min ~ 10^10 M_sun produce bubbles with a characteristic
radius of R_b ~ 0.48 Mpc/h. Both numbers are consistent with naive theoretical
expectations, where the minimum galaxy mass reflects the threshold for infall
of gas out of a photo-ionized IGM. The observed gaps are typically bounded by
deep absorption features as expected from the accumulation of swept-up gas on

"The Growth of the Local Void and the Origin of the Local Velocity
  Anomaly","The Local Void is the nearest void from us and is thought to be playing an
important role in the kinematics of the local universe, especially as one of
the suspected source of the motion of the Local Group. The imbalance between
the mass in the Local Void region and that contained in the concentration at
the opposite side might contribute to the velocity of the Local group
perpendicular to the Supergalactic plane, and this would be a prototype of the
evolution of the large-scale structure. The proximity of the Local Void
provides us the exclusive opportunity to investigate the kinematics around a
void. Here we report the results of our observational study of the peculiar
velocities of about 40 galaxies at the far-side of the Local Void, using the
near-infrared Tully-Fisher relation. The galaxies at the boundary of the void
shows an excess of receding motion, suggesting the expansion of the Local Void.
We examined the effect of selection biases on the peculiar velocity
distribution, and concluded that the excess of receding motion could not fully
attribute to selection biases.",2005-05-26T10:58:26Z
Recent Searches for the Radio Lines of NH_3 in Comets,"Radio observations in the ammonia inversion lines of four comets, C/2001 A2
(LINEAR), 153P/Ikeya-Zhang, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) and C/2002 T7 (LINEAR), were
performed at the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope during their respective close
approaches to Earth. None of the four lowest energy metastable lines
(J,K=J),J=1--4, could be detected in these comets. We derive the following 3
sigma upper bounds on the NH_3 production rate, and c omparing to the
corresponding water production rates, percentage NH_3 abundances relative to
H_2O:
  Q(NH_3) < 1.9x10^26 s^-1 (0.63%) for C/2001 A2 (LINEAR),
  Q(NH_3) < 2.7x10^26 s^-1 (0.13%) for C/2001 Q4 (NEAT),
  Q(NH_3) < 2.3x10^27 s^-1 (0.74%) for C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) and Q(NH_3) <=
6.3x10^26 s^-1 (0.63%) for Comet 153P/Ikeya-Zhang.
  At 0.74% or less, the ammonia-to-water ratios are factors of 2 below the
value for C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) and 1P/Halley, suggesting chemical diversity
between comets. The 18-cm lines of OH were clearly detected in the two comets
observed during the 2004 campaign, thereby validating the cometary ephemerides.",2005-05-20T13:47:08Z
"Nonthermal hard X-ray excess in the cluster Abell 2256 from two epoch
  observations","After confirmation of the presence of a nonthermal hard X-ray excess with
respect to the thermal emission in the Coma cluster from two independent
observations, obtained using the Phoswich Detection System onboard BeppoSAX, we
present in this Letter also for Abell 2256 the results of two observations
performed with a time interval of about 2.5 yr. In both spectra a nonthermal
excess is present at a confidence level of ~3.3sigma and ~3.7sigma,
respectively. The combined spectrum obtained by adding up the two spectra
allows to measure an excess at the level of ~4.8sigma in the 20-80 keV energy
range. The nonthermal X-ray flux is in agreement with the published value of
the first observation (Fusco-Femiano et al. 2000) and with that measured by a
Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer observation (Rephaeli & Gruber 2003).",2005-04-06T12:14:20Z
"A Mid-Infrared Imaging Survey of Embedded Young Stellar Objects in the
  Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Core","Results of a comprehensive, new, ground-based mid-infrared imaging survey of
the young stellar population of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud are presented. Data were
acquired at the Palomar 5-m and at the Keck 10-m telescopes with the MIRLIN and
LWS instruments, at 0.25 arcsec and 0.25 arcsec resolutions, respectively. Of
172 survey objects, 85 were detected. Among the 22 multiple systems observed,
15 were resolved and their individual component fluxes determined. A plot of
the frequency distribution of the detected objects with SED spectral slope
shows that YSOs spend ~400,000 yr in the Flat Spectrum phase, clearing out
their remnant infall envelopes. Mid-infrared variability is found among a
significant fraction of the surveyed objects, and is found to occur for all SED
classes with optically thick disks. Large-amplitude near-infrared variability,
also found for all SED classes with optically thick disks, seems to occur with
somewhat higher frequency at the earlier evolutionary stages. Although a
general trend of mid-infrared excess and NIR veiling exists proceeding through
SED classes, with Class I objects generally exhibiting K-veilings > 1, Flat
Spectrum objects with K-veilings > 0.58, and Class III objects with K-veilings
=0, Class II objects exhibit the widest range of K-band veiling values, 0-4.5.
However, the highly variable value of veiling that a single source can exhibit
in any of the SED classes in which active disk accretion can take place is
striking, and is direct observational evidence for highly time-variable
accretion activity in disks. Finally, by comparing mid-infrared vs.
near-infrared excesses in a subsample with well-determined effective
temperatures and extinction values, disk clearing mechanisms are explored. The
results are consistent with disk clearing proceeding from the inside-out.",2005-04-19T22:04:33Z
"A VSA search for the extended Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in the Corona
  Borealis Supercluster","We present interferometric imaging at 33 GHz of the Corona Borealis
supercluster, using the extended configuration of the Very Small Array. A total
area of 24 deg^2 has been imaged, with an angular resolution of 11 arcmin and a
sensitivity of 12 mJy/beam. The aim of these observations is to search for
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) detections from known clusters of galaxies in this
supercluster and for a possible extended SZ decrement due to diffuse warm/hot
gas in the intercluster medium. We measure negative flux values in the
positions of the ten richest clusters in the region. Collectively, this implies
a 3.0-sigma detection of the SZ effect. In the clusters A2061 and A2065 we find
decrements of approximately 2-sigma. Our main result is the detection of two
strong and resolved negative features at -70+-12 mJy/beam (-157+-27 microK) and
-103+-10 mJy/beam (-230+-23 microK), respectively, located in a region with no
known clusters, near the centre of the supercluster. We discuss their possible
origins in terms of primordial CMB anisotropies and/or SZ signals related to
either unknown clusters or to a diffuse extended warm/hot gas distribution. Our
analyses have revealed that a primordial CMB fluctuation is a plausible
explanation for the weaker feature (probability of 37.82%). For the stronger
one, neither primordial CMB (probability of 0.33%) nor SZ can account alone for
its size and total intensity. The most reasonable explanation, then, is a
combination of both primordial CMB and SZ signal. Finally, we explore what
characteristics would be required for a filamentary structure consisting of
warm/hot diffuse gas in order to produce a significant contribution to such a
spot taking into account the constraints set by X-ray data.",2005-07-12T13:36:31Z
X-ray spectroscopy of PSR B1951+32 and its pulsar wind nebula,"We present spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of PSR B1951+32 and its
pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 80 using a {\sl
Chandra} observation. The {\sl Chandra} X-ray map reveals clearly various
components of a ram-pressure confined PWN embedded in the SNR ejecta: a point
source representing the pulsar, X-ray emission from the bow shock, a luminous
X-ray tail, a 30$\arcsec$ diameter plateau whose northwestern part is absent,
and the outside more diffuse X-ray emission. The plateau is just surrounded by
the radio, [O III], [S II], and [N II] shells, and the outside diffuse emission
is mostly within the H${\alpha}$ shells. While the spectra of all the features
are well fitted with power law models, a power law plus blackbody model can fit
the spectrum of the pulsar significantly better than using a power law model
alone. Generally the spectra of these components obey the trend of steepening
from the inside to the outside. However, the edge of the plateau probably has a
harder spectrum than that of the central region of the plateau. The cause of
the apparent hard spectrum of the plateau edge is unclear, and we speculate
that it might be due to a shock between the PWN and the SNR ejecta. The
possible blackbody radiation component from the pulsar has a temperature of
0.13$\pm0.02$ keV and an equivalent emitting radius of 2.2$^{+1.4}_{-0.8}$ (d/2
kpc) km, and is thus probably from the hot spots on the pulsar. We also show in
this paper that the blackbody temperature of the entire surface of PSR B1951+32
is much lower than those predicted by the standard neutron star cooling models.",2005-04-13T10:26:31Z
The Cosmic Near Infrared Background: Remnant Light from Early Stars,"The redshifted ultraviolet light from early stars at z ~ 10 contributes to
the cosmic near infrared background. We present detailed calculations of its
spectrum with various assumptions about metallicity and mass spectrum of early
stars. We show that if the near infrared background has a stellar origin,
metal-free stars are not the only explanation of the excess near infrared
background; stars with metals (e.g. Z=1/50 Z_sun) can produce the same amount
of background intensity as the metal-free stars. We quantitatively show that
the predicted average intensity at 1-2 microns is essentially determined by the
efficiency of nuclear burning in stars, which is not very sensitive to
metallicity. We predict \nu I_\nu / \dot{\rho}_* ~ 4-8 nW m^-2 sr^-1, where
\dot{\rho_*} is the mean star formation rate at z=7-15 (in units of M_sun yr^-1
Mpc^-3) for stars more massive than 5 M_sun. On the other hand, since we have
very little knowledge about the form of mass spectrum of early stars,
uncertainty in the average intensity due to the mass spectrum could be large.
An accurate determination of the near infrared background allows us to probe
formation history of early stars, which is difficult to constrain by other
means. While the star formation rate at z=7-15 inferred from the current data
is significantly higher than the local rate at z<5, it does not rule out the
stellar origin of the cosmic near infrared background. In addition, we show
that a reasonable initial mass function, coupled with this star formation rate,
does not over-produce metals in the universe in most cases, and may produce as
little as less than 1 % of the metals observed in the universe today.",2005-08-08T16:42:15Z
The Current Flows in Pulsar Magnetospheres,"The global structure of the current flows in pulsar magnetospheres is
investigated, with rough calculations of the elements in the magnetospheric
circuit. It is emphasized that the potential of critical field lines is the
same as that of interstellar medium, and that the pulsars whose rotation axes
and magnetic dipole axes are parallel should be positively charged, in order to
close the pulsar's current flows. The statistical relation between the radio
luminosity and pulsar's electric charge (or the spindown power) may hint that
the millisecond pulsars could be low-mass bare strange stars.",2005-07-19T04:21:40Z
"The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation of Galaxies with Extended Rotation
  Curves and the Stellar Mass of Rotating Galaxies","I investigate the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for a sample of galaxies
with extended 21 cm rotation curves spanning the range 20 < Vf < 300 km/s. A
variety of scalings of the stellar mass-to-light ratio are considered. For each
prescription for M/L, I give fits of the form Md = A Vf^x. Presumably, the
prescription that comes closest to the correct value will minimize the scatter
in the relation. The fit with minimum scatter has A = 50 solar masses/(km/s)^4
and x = 4. This relation holds over five decades in mass. Galaxy color, stellar
fraction, and M/L are correlated with each other and with Md, in the sense that
more massive galaxies tend to be more evolved. There is a systematic dependence
of the degree of maximality of disks on surface brightness. High surface
brightness galaxies typically have M/L ~ 3/4 of the maximum disk value, while
low surface brightness galaxies typically attain ~ 1/4 of this amount.",2005-06-30T08:59:14Z
"Electron Positron Capture Rates and the Steady State Equilibrium
  Condition for Electron-Positron Plasma with Nucleons","The reaction rates of the beta processes for all particles at arbitrary
degeneracy are derived, and an {\it analytic} steady state equilibrium
condition $\mu_n=\mu_p+2\mu_e$ which results from the equality of electron and
positron capture rates in the hot electron-positron plasma with nucleons is
also found, if the matter is transparent to neutrinos. This simple analytic
formula is valid only if electrons are nondegenerate or mildly degenerate,
which is generally satisfied in the hot electron-positron plasma. Therefore, it
can be used to efficiently determine the steady state of the hot matter with
plenty of positrons. Based on this analytic condition, given the baryon number
density and the temperature, if the nucleons are nondegenerate, only one
algebraic equation for determining the electron fraction is obtained, which
shows the great advantage of the analytic equilibrium condition.",2005-07-13T03:49:23Z
The thermonuclear production of F19 by Wolf-Rayet stars revisited,"New models of rotating and non-rotating stars are computed for initial masses
between 25 and 120 Msun and for metallicities Z = 0.004, 0.008, 0.020 and 0.040
with the aim of reexamining the wind contribution of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars to
the F19 enrichment of the interstellar medium. Models with an initial rotation
velocity vini = 300 km/s are found to globally eject less F19 than the
non-rotating models. We compare our new predictions with those of Meynet &
Arnould (2000), and demonstrate that the F19 yields are very sensitive to the
still uncertain F19(alpha,p)Ne22 rate and to the adopted mass loss rates. Using
the recommended mass loss rate values that take into account the clumping of
the WR wind and the NACRE reaction rates when available, we obtain WR F19
yields that are significantly lower than predicted by Meynet & Arnould (2000),
and that would make WR stars non-important contributors to the galactic F19
budget. In view, however, of the large nuclear and mass loss rate
uncertainties, we consider that the question of the WR contribution to the
galactic F19 remains quite largely open.",2005-08-01T10:15:12Z
CCD photometry of 23 minor planets,"We present CCD photometric observations of 23 main-belt asteroids, of which 8
have never been observed before thus the data of these objects are the first in
the literature. The majority showed well detectable light variations, exceeding
0.1 mag. We have determined synodic periods for 756 Lilliana (9.36h), 1270
Datura (3.4h), 1400 Tirela (13.36h), 1503 Kuopio (9.98h), 3682 Welther (3.59h),
7505 Furushu (4.14h) and 11436 1969 QR (2.6h), while uncertain period estimates
were possible for 469 Argentina (12.3h), 546 Herodias (10.4h) and 1026 Ingrid
(5.3h). The shape of the lightcurves of 3682 Welther changed on a short
time-scale and showed dimmings that might be attributed to eclipses in a binary
system. For the remaining objects, only lower limits of the periods and
amplitudes were concluded.",2005-04-21T08:07:48Z
"VLBI phase-reference observations of the gravitational lens JVAS
  B0218+357","We present the results of phase-referenced VLBA+Effelsberg observations at
five frequencies of the double-image gravitational lens JVAS B0218+357, made to
establish the precise registration of the A and B lensed image positions. The
motivation behind these observations is to investigate the anomalous variation
of the image flux density ratio (A/B) with frequency - this ratio changes by
almost a factor of two over a frequency range from 1.65 GHz to 15.35 GHz. We
investigate whether frequency dependent image positions, combined with a
magnification gradient across the image field, could give rise to the anomaly.
Our observations confirm the variation of image flux ratio with frequency. The
results from our phase-reference astrometry, taken together with the lens mass
model of Wucknitz et al. (2004), show that shifts of the image peaks and
centroids are too small to account for the observed frequency-dependent ratio.",2005-08-09T08:16:56Z
"The all-sky distribution of 511 keV electron-positron annihilation
  emission","We present a map of 511 keV electron-positron annihilation emission, based on
data accumulated with the SPI spectrometer aboard ESA's INTEGRAL gamma-ray
observatory, that covers approximately 95% of the celestial sphere. 511 keV
line emission is significantly detected towards the galactic bulge region and,
at a very low level, from the galactic disk. The bulge emission is highly
symmetric and is centred on the galactic centre with an extension of 8 deg. The
emission is equally well described by models that represent the stellar bulge
or halo populations. The disk morphology is only weakly constrained by the
present data, being compatible with both the distribution of young and old
stellar populations. The 511 keV line flux from the bulge and disk components
is 1.05e-3 ph cm-2 s-1 and 0.7e-3 ph cm-2 s-1, respectively, corresponding to a
bulge-to-disk flux ratio in the range 1-3. Assuming a positronium fraction of
0.93 this translates into annihilation rates of 1.5e43 s-1 and 3e42 s-1,
respectively. The ratio of the bulge luminosity to that of the disk is in the
range 3-9. We find no evidence for a point-like source in addition to the
diffuse emission, down to a typical flux limit of 1e-4 ph cm-2 s-1. We also
find no evidence for the positive latitude enhancement that has been reported
from OSSE measurements; our 3 sigma upper flux limit for this feature is 1.5e-4
ph cm-2 s-1. The disk emission can be attributed to the beta+ decay of the
radioactive species 26Al and 44Ti. The bulge emission arises from a different
source which has only a weak or no disk component. We suggest that Type Ia
supernovae and/or low-mass X-ray binaries are the prime candidates for the
source of the galactic bulge positrons. Light dark matter annihilation could
also explain the observed 511 keV bulge emission characteristics.",2005-06-01T18:47:26Z
"Outflowing material in the CSS quasar 3C48: evidence of jet-cloud
  interaction?","We report the detection of a zabs=0.3654 associated absorption-line system in
the UV spectrum of the CSS quasar 3C48. The absorbing material is blue shifted
with respect to the quasar emission-line redshift, zem=0.3700, suggesting an
outflow velocity of ~1000 km/s. We detect absorption lines over a range of
ionization states from Ly-beta, Ly-gamma, CIV, NIV, SVI to OVI and possibly OIV
and NeVIII. The kinematical properties of the absorption-line system are
similar to the blue-shifted emission line gas seen in [OIII]\lambda5007
(Chatzichristou, Vanderriest & Jaffe 1999), which is believed to have
interacted with the radio jet. We study the properties of the absorbing
material using CLOUDY and find that photoionization models with Solar abundance
ratios (with overall metallicity in the range 0.1<Z/Z$_\odot$<1.3) are enough
to explain the observed column densities of all the species except NeVIII,
detection of which requires confirmation. Since the cooling and recombination
time for the gas is ~10^5 yr, the consistency with the photoionization models
suggests that any possible interaction of absorbing material with the jet must
have taken place before ~10^5 yr. The abundance ratio of nitrogen to carbon is
close to Solar values, unlike in the case of most quasars, especially at
high-redshifts, which have super-Solar values. We observed 3C48 with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to search for redshifted 21cm HI absorption.
However, we did not detect any significant feature in our spectra and estimate
the 3-sigma upper limit to the optical depth to be in the range 0.001 to 0.003.
However, due to the diffuse nature of the radio source, optical depths as high
as 0.1 towards individual knots or compact components cannot be ruled out.",2005-05-06T12:57:43Z
e-VLBI observations of SN2001em - an off-axis GRB candidate,"Studying transient phenomena with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) technique faces severe difficulties because the turnaround time of the
experiments from the observations to the scientific result is rather long. The
e-VLBI technique has made it possible to transfer the data from a number of
European VLBI Network (EVN) telescopes to the central data processor at JIVE
through optical fibres, and correlate them in real time. The main goal of this
paper is to introduce this rapidly developing new technique, by presenting
observational results from a recent experiment. We observed SN2001em, a Type
Ib/c supernova with an e-VLBI array and the Multi-Element Radio Linked
Interferometer Network (MERLIN) in the UK. The source is marginally detected in
our observations. We cannot make definite conclusions whether it is resolved at
1.6 GHz or not. Our data show that SN2001em either started fading in the last
couple of months, or its radio spectrum is inverted at low
frequencies,indicating free-free or synchrotron self-absorption. This is quite
unusual, but not unprecedented in radio SNe.",2005-05-23T08:52:09Z
Total and Jet Blandford-Znajek Power in Presence of Accretion Disk,"A rotating black hole probably powers ultrarelativistic jets in gamma-ray
bursts, relativistic jets from some active galactic nuclei, and jets from some
black hole x-ray binaries. Prior estimates of the power output of a black hole
have assumed an infinitely thin disk, a magnetic field based upon a slowly
rotating black hole, and have not self-consistently determined the geometry or
magnitude of the magnetic field for a realistic accretion disk. We provide
useful formulae for the total and jet Blandford-Znajek (BZ) power and
efficiency as determined self-consistently from general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic numerical models. Of all jet mechanisms, we suggest that
only the BZ mechanism is able to produce an ultrarelativistic jet.",2005-06-16T17:53:25Z
Radiative Transfer and Acceleration in Magnetocentrifugal Winds,"Detailed photoionization and radiative acceleration of self-similar
magnetocentrifugal accretion disk winds are explored. First, a general-purpose
hybrid magnetocentrifugal and radiatively-driven wind model is defined.
Solutions are then examined to determine how radiative acceleration modifies
magnetocentrifugal winds and how those winds can influence radiative driving in
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For the models studied here, both radiative
acceleration by bound-free (``continuum-driving'') and bound-bound
(``line-driving'') processes are found to be important, although magnetic
driving dominates the mass outflow rate for the Eddington ratios studied
(L/L_Edd = 0.001 - 0.1). The solutions show that shielding by a
magnetocentrifugal wind can increase the efficiency of a radiatively-driven
wind, and also that, within a magnetocentrifugal wind, radiative acceleration
is sensitive to both the column in the shield, the column of the wind and the
initial density at the base of the wind.",2005-06-14T20:04:13Z
"On the Extreme Positive Feedback Star-Forming Mode from Massive and
  Compact Superstar Clusters","The force of gravity acting within the volume occupied by young, compact and
massive superstar clusters, is here shown to drive in situ all the matter
deposited by winds and supernovae into several generations of star formation.
These events are promoted by radiative cooling which drains the thermal energy
of the ejected gas causing its accumulation to then rapidly exceed the
gravitational instability criterion. A detailed account of the integrated
ionizing radiation and mechanical luminosity as a function of time is here
shown to lead to a new stationary solution. In this, the mass deposition rate
$\dot M$, instead of causing a wind as in the adiabatic solution, turns into a
positive feedback star-forming mode equal to the star formation rate. Some of
the implications of this extreme positive feedback mode are discussed.",2005-06-13T17:44:11Z
From Little Bangs to the Big Bang,"The `Little Bangs' made in particle collider experiments reproduce the
conditions in the Big Bang when the age of the Universe was a fraction of a
second. It is thought that matter was generated, the structures in the Universe
were formed and cold dark matter froze out during this very early epoch when
the equation of state of the Universe was dominated by the quark-gluon plasma
(QGP). Future Little Bangs may reveal the mechanism of matter generation and
the nature of cold dark matter. Knowledge of the QGP will be an essential
ingredient in quantitative understanding of the very early Universe.",2005-04-22T15:01:03Z
Radio Detection of Extensive Air Showers with CODALEMA,"The principle and performances of the CODALEMA experimental device, set up to
study the possibility of high energy cosmic rays radio detection, are
presented. Radio transient signals associated to cosmic rays have been
identified, for which arrival directions and shower's electric field topologies
have been extracted from the antenna signals. The measured rate, about 1 event
per day, corresponds to an energy threshold around 5.10^16 eV. These results
allow to determine the perspectives offered by the present experimental design
for radiodetection of UHECR at a larger scale.",2005-07-07T07:51:19Z
Dual frequency VSOP imaging of the jet in S5 0836+710,"The luminous high-redshift (z=2.17) quasar S50836+710 has been observed in
October 1997 with the VSOP at 1.6 GHz and 5 GHz. We report here a previously
unpublished image made from the data at 1.6 GHz and compare the structure of a
relativistic jet in this quasazr at the two frequencies. We present a spectral
index image tracing spectral properties of the jet up to ~40 milliarcsecond
distance from the nucleus. The curved jet ridge line observed in the images and
the spectral index distribution can be described by Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability developing in a relativistic outflow with a Mach number of ~6. In
this description, the overall ridge line of the jet is formed by the helical
surface mode of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, while areas of flatter spectral
index embedded into the flow correspond to pressure enhancements produced by
the elliptical surface mode of the instability. An alternative explanation
involving a sequence of slowly dissipating shocks cannot be ruled out at this
point.",2005-07-28T15:00:12Z
"Discovery of Five New R Coronae Borealis Stars in the MACHO Galactic
  Bulge Database","We have identified five new R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Galactic
bulge using the MACHO Project photometry database, raising the total number of
known Galactic RCB stars to about 40. We have obtained spectra to confirm the
identifications. The fact that four out of the five newly identified RCB stars
are ``cool'' (T(eff) < 6000 K) rather than ``warm'' (T(eff) > 6000 K) suggests
that the preponderance of warm RCB stars among the existing sample is a
selection bias. These cool RCB stars are redder and fainter than their warm
counterparts and may have been missed in surveys done with blue plates. Based
on the number of new RCB stars discovered in the MACHO bulge fields, there may
be ~250 RCB stars in the reddened ""exclusion"" zone toward the bulge.",2005-07-22T21:28:49Z
"A stability analysis of radiative shocks in the presence of a transverse
  magnetic field","Radiative shock waves may be subject to a global thermal instability in which
the cooling layer and shock front undergo growing resonant oscillations. For
strong hydrodynamic shocks, the presence of the overstability depends on the
temperature and density indices of power-law cooling functions and the specific
heat ratio, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, respectively. Here, we investigate
the stabilising influence of a transverse magnetic field by introducing the
shock Alfv\'en number, $M_a$ as a fourth parameter. We thus investigate the
stability criteria for both molecular and atomic shocks under a wide range of
conditions. In particular, we find that all molecular shocks in which the
cooling increases with the temperature ($\alpha > 0$) are stabilised to the
first four modes if $M_a < 20$ ($\beta = 2$). For $\alpha = -0.5$, the first
overtone remains stable only for $M_a < 8$. We conclude that molecular shocks
in the interstellar medium are probably stabilised by a transverse magnetic
field unless exceptional circumstances arise in which the cooling strongly
increases as the gas cools.",2005-05-03T15:49:10Z
A new intermediate mass protostar in the Cepheus A HW2 region,"We present the discovery of the first molecular hot core associated with an
intermediate mass protostar in the CepA HW2 region. The hot condensation was
detected from single dish and interferometric observations of several high
excitation rotational lines (from 100 to 880K above the ground state) of SO2 in
the ground vibrational state and of HC3N in the vibrationally excited states
v7=1 and v7=2. The kinetic temperature derived from both molecules is 160K. The
high-angular resolution observations (1.25'' x 0.99'') of the SO2
J=28(7,21)-29(6,24) line (488K above the ground state) show that the hot gas is
concentrated in a compact condensation with a size of 0.6''(430AU), located
0.4'' (300AU) east from the radio-jet HW2. The total SO2 column density in the
hot condensation is 10E18cm-2, with a H2 column density ranging from 10E23 to 6
x 10E24cm-2. The H2 density and the SO2 fractional abundance must be larger
than 10E7cm-3 and 2 x 10E-7 respectively. The most likely alternatives for the
nature of the hot and very dense condensation are discussed. From the large
column densities of hot gas, the detection of the HC3N vibrationally excited
lines and the large SO2 abundance, we favor the interpretation of a hot core
heated by an intermediate mass protostar of 10E3 Lo. This indicates that the
CepA HW2 region contains a cluster of very young stars.",2005-06-22T11:04:29Z
CMB Anisotropy Due to Tangled magnetic fields in re-ionized models,"Primordial tangled cosmological Magnetic Fields source rotational velocity

These vortical modes inturn leave a characteristic imprint on the temperature
anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), if the CMB photons can be
re-scatterred after recombination. Observations from WMAP indicate that the
Universe underwent a relatively early re-ionization ($z_{ri} \sim 15$), which
does indeed lead to a significant optical depth for re-scattering of CMB
photons after the re-ionization epoch. We compute the resulting additional
temperature anisotropies, induced by primordial magnetic fields in the
post-recombination universe. We show that in models with early re-ionization, a
nearly scale-invariant spectrum of tangled magnetic fields which redshift to a
present value of $B_0 \sim 3 \times 10^{-9}$ Gauss, produce vector mode
perturbations which in turn induce additional temperature anisotropy of about
0.3 to 0.4 $ \mu$K over very small angular scales, with $ l$ upto $\sim 10000 $
or so.",2005-04-01T02:05:44Z
RAM: A Relativistic Adaptive Mesh Refinement Hydrodynamics Code,"We have developed a new computer code, RAM, to solve the conservative
equations of special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) using adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) on parallel computers. We have implemented a
characteristic-wise, finite difference, weighted essentially non-oscillatory
(WENO) scheme using the full characteristic decomposition of the SRHD equations
to achieve fifth-order accuracy in space. For time integration we use the
method of lines with a third-order total variation diminishing (TVD)
Runge-Kutta scheme. We have also implemented fourth and fifth order Runge-Kutta
time integration schemes for comparison. The implementation of AMR and
parallelization is based on the FLASH code. RAM is modular and includes the
capability to easily swap hydrodynamics solvers, reconstruction methods and
physics modules. In addition to WENO we have implemented a finite volume module
with the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) for reconstruction and the modified
Marquina approximate Riemann solver to work with TVD Runge-Kutta time
integration. We examine the difficulty of accurately simulating shear flows in
numerical relativistic hydrodynamics codes. We show that under-resolved
simulations of simple test problems with transverse velocity components produce
incorrect results and demonstrate the ability of RAM to correctly solve these
problems. RAM has been tested in one, two and three dimensions and in
Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates. We have demonstrated
fifth-order accuracy for WENO in one and two dimensions and performed detailed
comparison with other schemes for which we show significantly lower convergence
rates. Extensive testing is presented demonstrating the ability of RAM to
address challenging open questions in relativistic astrophysics.",2005-05-23T20:36:49Z
A Complete Sample of Megaparsec Size Double Radio Sources from SUMSS,"We present a complete sample of megaparsec-size double radio sources compiled
from the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS). Almost complete
redshift information has been obtained for the sample. The sample has the
following defining criteria: Galactic latitude |b| > 12.5 deg, declination <
-50 deg and angular size > 5 arcmin. All the sources have projected linear size
larger than 0.7 Mpc (assuming H_o = 71 km/s/Mpc). The sample is chosen from a
region of the sky covering 2100 square degrees. In this paper, we present
843-MHz radio images of the extended radio morphologies made using the Molonglo
Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST), higher resolution radio observations of
any compact radio structures using the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA), and low resolution optical spectra of the host galaxies from the 2.3-m
Australian National University (ANU) telescope at Siding Spring Observatory.
The sample presented here is the first in the southern hemisphere and
significantly enhances the database of known giant radio sources. The giant
radio sources with linear size exceeding 0.7 Mpc have an abundance of (215
Mpc)^(-3) at the sensitivity of the survey. In the low redshift universe, the
survey may be suggesting the possibility that giant radio sources with relict
lobes are more numerous than giant sources in which beams from the centre
currently energize the lobes.",2005-07-03T23:54:23Z
"The Lensed Arc Production Efficiency of Galaxy Clusters: A Comparison of
  Matched Observed and Simulated Samples","We compare the statistical properties of giant gravitationally lensed arcs
produced in matched simulated and observed cluster samples. The observed sample
consists of 10 X-ray selected clusters at redshifts z ~ 0.2 imaged with HST by
Smith et al. The simulated dataset is produced by lensing the Hubble Deep
Field, which serves as a background source image, with 150 realizations
(different projections and shifts) of five simulated z = 0.2 clusters from a
LambdaCDM N-body simulation. The real and simulated clusters have similar
masses, the real photometric redshift is used for each background source, and
all the observational effects influencing arc detection in the real dataset,
including light from cluster galaxies, are simulated in the artificial dataset.
We develop, and apply to both datasets, an objective automatic arc-finding
algorithm. We find consistent arc statistics in the real and in the simulated
sample, with an average of ~ 1 detected giant (length to width ratio >= 10) arc
per cluster and ~ 0.2 giant luminous (R<22.3 mag) arc per cluster. Thus, taking
into account a realistic source population and observational effects, the
clusters predicted by LambdaCDM have the same arc-production efficiency as the
observed clusters. If, as suggested by other studies, there is a discrepancy
between the predicted and the observed total number of arcs on the sky, it must
be the result of differences between the redshift dependent cluster mass
functions, and not due to differences in the lensing efficiency of the most
massive clusters.",2005-07-19T20:02:07Z
"The oscillation effects on thermalization of the neutrinos in the
  universe with low reheating temperature","We study how the oscillations of the neutrinos affect their thermalization
process during the reheating period with temperature O(1) MeV in the early
universe. We follow the evolution of the neutrino density matrices and
investigate how the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis vary with the
reheating temperature. For the reheating temperature of several MeV, we find
that including the oscillations makes different predictions, especially for
$^4$He abundance. Also, the effects on the lower bound of the reheating
temperature from cosmological observations are discussed.",2005-05-19T07:26:54Z
Stellar Processes Near the Massive Black Hole in the Galactic Center,"A massive black hole resides in the center of most, perhaps all galaxies. The
one in the center of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, provides a uniquely
accessible laboratory for studying in detail the connections and interactions
between a massive black hole and the stellar system in which it grows; for
investigating the effects of extreme density, velocity and tidal fields on
stars; and for using stars to probe the central dark mass and probe
post-Newtonian gravity in the weak- and strong-field limits. Recent results,
open questions and future prospects are reviewed in the wider context of the
theoretical framework and physical processes that underlie them.

"The Transit Light Curve Project. IV. Five Transits of the Exoplanet
  OGLE-TR-10b","We present I and B photometry of five distinct transits of the exoplanet
OGLE-TR-10b. By modeling the light curves, we find the planetary radius to be
R_P = 1.06 +/- 0.08 R_Jup and the stellar radius to be R_S = 1.10 +/- 0.07
R_sun. The uncertainties are dominated by statistical errors in the photometry.
Our estimate of the planetary radius is smaller than previous estimates that
were based on lower-precision photometry, and hence the planet is not as
anomalously large as was previously thought. We provide updated determinations
of all the system parameters, including the transit ephemerides.",2005-06-24T13:47:39Z
Search for muon enhancement at sea level from transient solar activity,"This paper presents first results of an ongoing study of a possible
association between muon enhancements at ground observed by the TUPI telescope
and transient events such as the Sun's X-ray activity. The analysis of the
observed phenomenon by using the GOES satellite archive data seems to indicate
that on most cases the Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs) could potentially be
associated with solar flares. We show that small scale solar flares, those with
prompt X-ray emission classified as C class (power above $10^{-6}Watts m^{-2}$
at 1 AU) may give rise to GLEs, probably associated with solar protons and ions
arriving to the Earth as a coherent particle pulse. The TUPI telescope's high
performance with these energetic solar particles arises mainly from: (1) its
high counting rate (up to $\sim 100$ KHz). This value in most cases is around
100 times higher than other detectors at ground and (2) due to its tracking
system. The telescope is always looking near the direction of the IMF lines.
The GLE's delay in relation of the X-ray prompt emission suggest that shock
driven by corona mass ejection (CME) is an essential requirement for the
particle acceleration efficiency.",2005-04-28T17:59:57Z
"Gamma-Ray Burst Selected High Redshift Galaxies: Comparison to Field
  Galaxy Populations to z~3","We study the internal structural properties of 37 long duration gamma-ray
burst (GRB) host galaxies imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope. Fitting
exponential disk and r^1/4 models to the surface brightness profiles of eight z
< 1.2 bright host galaxies, we find that the disk model is slightly preferred
for most hosts, although two galaxies are fit best with an r^1/4 profile. We
furthermore measure the central concentrations and asymmetries of all 37 host
galaxies using the CAS system, and compare with field galaxies in the Hubble
Deep Field. Our first main conclusion is that GRB hosts exhibit a surprisingly
high diversity of galaxy types. A significant fraction (68%) of host galaxies
are situated in a region of the concentration-asymmetry diagram occupied by
spirals or peculiar/merging galaxies. Twelve hosts (32%) are situated in the
region occupied by elliptical galaxies, having high concentration indices. We
also find some evidence for evolution in GRB host galaxy morphology, such that
hosts at z > 1 have a relatively high light concentration, indicating that
these systems are perhaps progenitors of massive galaxies, or are compact blue
star forming galaxies. We find that GRB hosts at z > 1 are different from the
general field population at z > 1 in terms of light concentration at >99.5%
confidence, yet have sizes similar to the general z > 1 population. This is the
opposite of the effect at z < 1 where GRB hosts are smaller than average. We
argue that GRB hosts trace the starburst population at high redshift, as
similarly concentrated galaxies at z > 1 are undergoing a disproportionate
amount of star formation for their luminosities. Our results show that GRBs are
perhaps ideal tracers of typical galaxies undergoing star formation at any
epoch.",2005-08-09T05:41:24Z
"The Highest Magnetic Fields in the Universe: Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars and
  Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters","In the last few years it has been recognized that two apparently distinct
classes of peculiar high-energy sources are actually related and can be
explained as young neutron stars with magnetic fields as high as 10e14 - 10e15
Gauss. One of these ''magnetars'', SGR 1806-20, has recently emitted the most
powerful giant flare ever recorded. The high-energy observations of SGR 1806-20
carried out with XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL in the past two years showed a long
term trend of increasing activity preceding the 2004 December 27 event.
INTEGRAL data of this giant flare provided unique evidence for hard X-ray
emission lasting about one hour after the burst onset, possibly due to the
interaction of mildly relativistic ejecta with the circumstellar medium.",2005-05-24T13:49:17Z
Flux Modulation from Non-Axisymmetric Stuctures in Accretion Discs,"Non-axisymmetric accretion discs can lead to flux variability. Here we
provide an analytic framework for modeling non-axisymmetric structures like
hotspots and spiral waves and their influence on observed timing measurements.
The presently unexplained Low-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (LFQPO),
observed in X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables, could be the result of
such discs. Our framework serves as a guide to quantify the properties that
non-axisymmetric structures produced by nonlinear accretion disc models must
have in order to explain observed features such as LFQPOs. The results from our
microquasar appliations also provide analogous predictions for X-ray modulation
in active galactic nuclei. The formalism and physical interpration is of
practical use for generic non-axisymmetric accretion disc systems.",2005-06-06T18:44:54Z
High Mass Triple Systems: The Classical Cepheid Y Car,"We have obtained an HST STIS ultraviolet high dispersion Echelle mode
spectrum the binary companion of the double mode classical Cepheid Y Car. The
velocity measured for the hot companion from this spectrum is very different
from reasonable predictions for binary motion, implying that the companion is
itself a short period binary. The measured velocity changed by 7 km/ s during
the 4 days between two segments of the observation confirming this
interpretation. We summarize ""binary"" Cepheids which are in fact members of
triple system and find at least 44% are triples. The summary of information on
Cepheids with orbits makes it likely that the fraction is under-estimated.",2005-04-07T00:33:23Z
Mirror World and Axion: Relaxing Cosmological Bounds,"The cosmological (upper) limit on the Peccei-Quinn constant, related to the
primordial oscillations of the axion field, can be relaxed for a mirror axion
model. The simple reason is that the mirror world is colder and so the behavior
of the axion temperature-dependent mass is dominated by the contribution from
the mirror sector. So the coherent oscillations start earlier and
correspondingly the axion mass density \Omega_a h^2 is reduced.",2005-04-28T16:14:46Z
"What are the temperatures of T Tauri stars? - Constraints from coeval
  formation of young eclipsing binaries","We show how the assumption of coeval formation can be used to constrain the
effective temperatures of the components of young eclipsing double-lined
spectroscopic binaries. Our method extends the approach of White et al. (1999)
to a two-step analysis. The first step compares evolutionary models to the
observed masses and radii and selects those models that predict ages that are
consistent with coeval formation. The second step then uses these models to
constrain the effective temperatures. We applied the method on literature
values of the stellar parameters of the eclipsing binaries RX J0529.4+0041 A
and V1174 Ori and confirm that V1174 Ori A has dwarf-like temperatures at an
age of 9 Myrs, while we cannot draw any conclusions for RX J0529.4+0041 A and
V1174 Ori B. Considering these binaries, we find that none of the evolutionary
models gives coeval solutions simultaneously in mass, radius and effective
temperature.",2005-06-30T18:13:34Z
"Modeling complete distributions with incomplete observations: The
  velocity ellipsoid from Hipparcos data","[abridged] A ""missing data"" algorithm is developed to model (ie, reconstruct)
the three-dimensional velocity distribution function of a sample of stars using
data (velocity measurements) every one of which has one dimension unmeasured
(the radial direction). It also accounts for covariant measurement
uncertainties on the tangential velocity components. The algorithm is applied
to tangential velocities measured in a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865
stars taken from the Hipparcos catalog. The local stellar velocity distribution
function of each of a set of 20 color-selected subsamples is modeled as a
mixture of two three-dimensional Gaussian ellipsoids of arbitrary relative
responsibility. In the fitting, one Gaussian (the ""halo"") is fixed at the known
mean velocity and velocity variance tensor of the Galaxy halo, and the other
(the ""disk"") is allowed to take arbitrary mean and arbitrary variance tensor.
The mean and variance tensor (commonly the ""velocity ellipsoid"") of the disk
velocity distribution are both found to be strong functions of stellar color,
with long-lived populations showing larger velocity dispersion, slower mean
rotation velocity, and smaller vertex deviation than short-lived populations.
The local standard of rest (LSR) is inferred in the usual way and the Sun's
motion relative to the LSR is found to be
(U,V,W)_{\odot}=(10.1,4.0,6.7)+/-(0.5,0.8,0.2) km/s. Artificial data sets are
made and analyzed, with the same error properties as the Hipparcos data, to
demonstrate that the analysis is unbiased. The results are shown to be
insensitive to the assumption that the velocity distributions are Gaussian.",2005-05-03T13:37:42Z
"The discovery of a galaxy-wide superwind from a young massive galaxy at
  redshift z~3","High-velocity galactic outflows, driven by intense bursts of star formation
and black hole accretion, are invoked by current theories of galaxy formation
to terminate star formation in the most massive galaxies and to deposit heavy
elements in the intergalactic medium. From existing observational evidence on
high-redshift galaxies, it is unclear whether such outflows are localized to
regions of intense star formation just a few kiloparsecs in extent, or whether
they instead have a significant impact on the entire galaxy and its
surroundings. Here we present two-dimensional spectroscopy of a star-forming
galaxy at redshift z=3.09 (seen 11.5 Gyr ago, when the Universe was 20 per cent
of its current age): its spatially extended Ly-alpha emission appears to be
absorbed by HI in a foreground screen covering the entire galaxy, with a
lateral extent of at least 100 kpc and remarkable velocity coherence. It was
plausibly ejected from the galaxy during a starburst several 1E8 yr earlier and
has subsequently swept up gas from the surrounding intergalactic medium and
cooled. This demonstrates the galaxy-wide impact of high-redshift superwinds.",2005-07-13T08:35:33Z
Simulations of galactic winds and starbursts in galaxy clusters,"We present an investigation of the metal enrichment of the intra-cluster
medium (ICM) by galactic winds and merger-driven starbursts. We use combined
N-body/hydrodynamic simulations with a semi-numerical galaxy formation model.
The mass loss by galactic winds is obtained by calculating transonic solutions
of steady state outflows, driven by thermal, cosmic ray and MHD wave pressure.
The inhomogeneities in the metal distribution caused by these processes are an
ideal tool to reveal the dynamical state of a galaxy cluster. We present
surface brightness, X-ray emission weighted temperature and metal maps of our
model clusters as they would be observed by X-ray telescopes like XMM-Newton.
We show that X-ray weighted metal maps distinguish between pre- or post-merger
galaxy clusters by comparing the metallicity distribution with the
galaxy-density distribution: pre-mergers have a metallicity gap between the
subclusters, post-mergers a high metallicity between subclusters. We apply our
approach to two observed galaxy clusters, Abell 3528 and Abell 3921, to show
whether they are pre- or post-merging systems. The survival time of the
inhomogeneities in the metallicity distribution found in our simulations is up
to several Gyr. We show that galactic winds and merger-driven starbursts enrich
the ICM very efficiently after z=1 in the central (~ 3 Mpc radius) region of a
galaxy cluster.",2005-08-03T14:17:01Z
Statefinder diagnostic for holographic dark energy model,"In this paper we study the holographic dark energy model proposed by Li from
the statefinder viewpoint. We plot the evolutionary trajectories of the model
with $c=1$ in the statefinder parameter-planes. The statefinder diagrams
characterize the properties of the holographic dark energy and show the
discrimination between this scenario and other dark energy models. We also
perform a statefinder diagnostic to the holographic dark energy model in cases
of different $c$ which given by three fits to observational data. The result
indicates that from the statefinder viewpoint $c$ plays a significant role in
this model and should thus be determined seriously by future high precision
experiments.",2005-04-27T08:36:31Z
"16 micron Imaging around the Hubble Deep Field North with the Spitzer
  IRS","We present a pilot study of 16 micron imaging within the GOODS northern
field. Observations were obtained using the PeakUp imaging capability of the
Spitzer IRS. We survey 35 square arcminutes to an average 3 sigma depth of
0.075 mJy and detect 149 sources. The survey partially overlaps the area imaged
at 15 microns by ISO, and we demonstrate that our photometry and galaxy-number
counts are consistent with their measurements. We infer the total infrared
luminosity of 16 micron detections using a comparison to local templates and
find a wide range of L_IR} from ~10^9 to 10^{12} L_sun. Approximately one fifth
of the detected sources have counterparts in the Chandra 2 Msec catalog, and we
show that the hard band (2-8 keV) detected sources are likely to have strong
AGN contributions to the X-ray flux. The ultradeep sensitivity of Chandra
implies some X-ray detections may be purely starbursting objects. We examine
the 16 to 24 micron flux ratio and conclude that it shows evidence for the
detection of redshifted PAH emission at z~0.5 and z>0.8.",2005-07-22T23:30:15Z
A Survey of Eclipsing Binary Stars in the Eastern Spiral Arm of M31,"Results of an archival survey are presented using B-band imaging of the
eastern spiral arm of M31. Focusing on the eclipsing binary star population, a
matched-filter technique has been used to identify 280 binary systems. Of
these, 127 systems (98 of which are newly discovered) have sufficient phase
coverage to allow accurate orbital periods to be determined. At least nine of
these binaries are detached systems which could, in principle, be used for
distance determination. The light curves of the detached and other selected
systems are presented along with a discussion of some of the more interesting
binaries. The impact of unresolved stellar blends on these lightcurves is
considered.",2005-06-23T19:50:41Z
"The Growth of the Local Void and the Origin of the Local Velocity
  Anomaly","The Local Void is the nearest void from us and is thought to be playing an
important role in the kinematics of the local universe, especially as one of
the suspected source of the motion of the Local Group. The imbalance between
the mass in the Local Void region and that contained in the concentration at
the opposite side might contribute to the velocity of the Local group
perpendicular to the Supergalactic plane, and this would be a prototype of the
evolution of the large-scale structure. The proximity of the Local Void
provides us the exclusive opportunity to investigate the kinematics around a
void. Here we report the results of our observational study of the peculiar
velocities of about 40 galaxies at the far-side of the Local Void, using the
near-infrared Tully-Fisher relation. The galaxies at the boundary of the void
shows an excess of receding motion, suggesting the expansion of the Local Void.
We examined the effect of selection biases on the peculiar velocity
distribution, and concluded that the excess of receding motion could not fully
attribute to selection biases.",2005-05-26T10:58:26Z
Optimal Estimation of Non-Gaussianity,"We systematically analyze the primordial non-Gaussianity estimator used by
the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) science team with the basic
ideas of estimation theory in order to see if the limited Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data is being optimally utilized. The WMAP estimator is based
on the implicit assumption that the CMB bispectrum, the harmonic transform of
the three-point correlation function, contains all of the primordial
non-Gaussianity information in a CMB map. We first demonstrate that the
Signal-to-Noise (S/N) of an estimator based on CMB three-point correlation
functions is significantly larger than the S/N of any estimator based on
higher-order correlation functions; justifying our choice to focus on the
three-point correlation function. We then conclude that the estimator based on
the three-point correlation function, which was used by WMAP, is optimal,
meaning it saturates the Cramer-Rao Inequality when the underlying CMB map is
nearly Gaussian. We quantify this restriction by demonstrating that the
suboptimal character of our estimator is proportonal to the square of the
fiducial non-Gaussianity, which is already constrained to be extremely small,
so we can consider the WMAP estimator to be optimal in practice. Our
conclusions do not depend on the form of the primordial bispectrum, only on the
observationally established weak levels of primordial non-Gaussianity.",2005-03-16T22:17:53Z
"Chandra High-Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy of the Fe K Line in the
  Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 3783","We report on the results of detailed X-ray spectroscopy of the Fe K region in
the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 from five ~170 ks observations with the Chandra
high energy gratings. Monitoring was conducted over an interval of ~125 days in
2001. The combined data constitute the highest signal-to-noise Fe K spectrum
having the best velocity resolution in the Fe K band to date (FWHM ~1860 km/s).
The data show a resolved Fe K line core with a center energy of 6.397 +/- 0.003
keV, consistent with an origin in neutral or lowly ionized Fe, located between
the BLR and NLR, as found by Kaspi et al. (2002). We also find that excess flux
around the base of the Fe K line core can be modeled with either a Compton
scattering ``shoulder'' or an emission line from a relativistic accretion disk,
having an inclination angle of 11 degrees or less. This disk line model is as
good as a Compton-shoulder model for the base of the Fe K line core. In the
latter model, the column density is 7.5 [+2.7,-0.6] x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, which
corresponds to a Thomson optical depth of ~0.60. An intrinsic width of 1500
[+460,-340] km/s FWHM is still required in this model. Moreover, more
complicated scenarios involving both a Compton-shoulder and a disk line cannot
be ruled out. We confirm an absorption feature due to He-like Fe (FWHM = 6405
[+5020,-2670] km/s), found in previous studies.",2005-03-28T20:46:07Z
A New Model for Iron Emission Lines and Re-Burst in GRB X-Ray Afterglows,"Recently iron emission features have been observed in several X-ray
afterglows of GRBs. It is found that the energy obtained from the illuminating
continuum which produces the emission lines is much higher than that of the
main burst.The observation of SN-GRB association indicates a fallback disk
should be formed after the supernovae explosion. The disk is optically thick
and advection-dominated and dense. We suggest that the delayed injection energy
after the initial main burst, much higher than energy of the main burst, causes
the re-burst appearance in GRB afterglow and illuminates the region of the disk
surface with $\tau\approx1$($\tau$ is the optical depth for the Thomson scatter
) and produces the iron emission line whose luminosity can be up to $10^{45}$
erg$s^{-1}$. The duration of the iron line emission can be $10^{4}-10^{5}$ s.
This model can explain the appearance of re-burst and emission lines in GRB
afterglow and disappearance of the iron emission lines, and also can naturally
solve the problem of higher energy of the illuminating continuum than that of
the main burst. This scenario is different from the models put forward to
explain the emission lines before, that can be tested by SWIFT satellite.",2005-04-25T07:44:45Z
Direct detection of exo-planets: GQ Lupi,"We present a comparison of our VLT/NACO K-band spectrum of the GQ Lupi

"Asteroseismology of the planet-hosting star mu Arae. II. Seismic
  analysis","As most exoplanets host stars, HD 160691 (alias mu Ara) presents a
metallicity excess in its spectrum compared to stars without detected planets.
This excess may be primordial, in which case the star would be completely
overmetallic, or it may be due to accretion in the early phases of planetary
formation, in which case it would be overmetallic only in its outer layers. As
discussed in a previous paper (Bazot and Vauclair 2004), seismology can help
choosing between the two scenarios. This star was observed during eight nights
with the spectrograph HARPS at La Silla Observatory. Forty three p-modes have
been identified (Bouchy et al. 2005). In the present paper, we discuss the
modelisation of this star. We computed stellar models iterated to present the
same observable parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, outer chemical
composition) while the internal structure was different according to the two
extreme assumptions : original overmetallicity or accretion. We show that in
any case the seismic constraints lead to models in complete agreement with the
external parameters deduced from spectroscopy and from the Hipparcos parallax
(L and Teff). We discuss the tests which may lead to a choice between the two
typical scenarios. We show that the ``small separation'' seem to give a better
fit for the accretion case than for the overmetallic case, but in spite of the
very good data the uncertainties are still too large to conclude. We discuss
the observations which would be needed to go further and solve this question.",2005-03-31T20:54:23Z
"Outflows in Infrared-Luminous Starbursts at z < 0.5. II. Analysis and
  Discussion","We have performed an absorption-line survey of outflowing gas in 78
starburst-dominated, infrared-luminous galaxies. This is the largest study of
superwinds at z < 3. Superwinds are found in almost all infrared-luminous
galaxies, and changes in detection rate with SFR--winds are found twice as
often in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) as in less-luminous
galaxies--reflect different wind geometries. The maximum velocities we measure
are 600 km/s, though most of the outflowing gas has lower velocities (100-200
km/s). (One galaxy has velocities exceeding 1000 km/s.) Velocities in LINERs
are higher than in HII galaxies, and outflowing ionized gas often has higher
velocities than the neutral gas. Wind properties (velocity, mass, momentum, and
energy) scale with galaxy properties (SFR, luminosity, and galaxy mass),
consistent with ram-pressure driving of the wind. Wind properties increase
strongly with increasing galactic mass, contrary to expectation. These
correlations flatten at high SFR (> 10-100 M_sun/yr), luminosities, and masses.
This saturation is due to a lack of gas remaining in the wind's path, a common
neutral gas terminal velocity, and/or a decrease in the efficiency of
thermalization of the supernovae energy. It means that mass entrainment
efficiency, rather than remaining constant, declines in galaxies with SFR > 10
M_sun/yr and M_K < -24. Half of our sample consists of ULIRGs, which host as
much as half of the star formation in the universe at z > 1. The powerful,
ubiquitous winds we observe in these galaxies imply that superwinds in massive
galaxies at redshifts above unity play an important role in the evolution of
galaxies and the intergalactic medium.",2005-06-24T20:28:46Z
"Increase in the Absorption Length of Inclined Extensive Air Showers with
  Different Selection Types","The dependence of the number of extensive air showers (EAS) on the zenith
angle is obtained in groups with a constant solid-angle step with different
election types at separations between stations of 500 and 1000 m by using the
Yakutsk EAS array data. A bend point is formed at the zenith angle
approximately of 50 deg. This point shifts with the increasing energy in the
direction corresponding to the shift of the cascade-curve maximum depth with
the variation of energy. The boundaries of change of these dependences obtained
separately at the distances between stations of 500 and 1000 m are different
that may be caused by the uncertainty of the lateral distribution function
(LDF) used. Thereby, energies of showers detected by the stations with a
different separation are not joined.",2005-06-28T01:23:09Z
The impact of gas physics on strong cluster lensing,"Previous studies of strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters neglected
the potential impact of the intracluster gas. Here, we compare simulations of
strong cluster lensing including gas physics at increasing levels of
complexity, i.e. with adiabatic, cooling, star-forming, feedback-receiving, and
thermally conducting gas, and with different implementations of the artificial
viscosity in the SPH simulations. Each cluster was simulated starting from the
same initial conditions such as to allow directly comparing the simulated
clusters. We compare the clusters' shapes, dynamics and density profiles and
study their strong-lensing cross sections computed by means of ray-tracing
simulations. We find that the impact of adiabatic gas depends on the amount of
turbulence that builds up, which means that the artificial viscosity plays an
important role. With the common viscosity implementation, adiabatic gas has
little effect on strong cluster lensing, while lower viscosity allows stronger
turbulence, thus higher non-thermal pressure and a generally broader gas
distribution which tends to lower lensing cross sections. Conversely, cooling
and star formation steepen the core density profiles and can thus increase the
strong-lensing efficiency considerably.",2005-04-08T15:49:30Z
The search for the host galaxy of the gamma-ray burst GRB 000214,"We present UBVRI-band observations taken ~300 days after the BeppoSAX
gamma-ray burst GRB 000214. This GRB did not show a detectable optical
afterglow, however due to the localization of a previously unknown, fading,
X-ray source at a tentative redshift in the range 0.37-0.47, we have searched
with the ESO 3.6 m telescope for objects with photometric redshifts consistent
with the mentioned X-ray redshift range. We report four host galaxy candidates,
which might be the subject of future spectroscopic observations in order to
confirm their redshifts.",2005-06-27T16:01:12Z
Disc-Disc Encounters between Low-Mass Protoplanetary Accretion Discs,"Simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of turbulent molecular clouds
and dense young clusters show that encounters between disc-surrounded stars are
relatively common events which should significantly influence the resulting
disc structure. In turn this should alter the accretion rate of disc matter
onto the star and the conditions under which planet formation occurs. Although
the effects of star-disc encounters have been previously investigated, very
little is known about encounters where both stars are surrounded by discs. In
this paper encounters of such disc-disc systems are studied quantitatively. It
is found that for low-mass discs ($M_D$= 0.01 $M_\sun$) the results from
star-disc encounters can be straightforwardly generalized to disc-disc
encounters as long as there is no mass transport between the discs. Differences
to star-disc encounters occur naturally where significant amounts of matter are
transported between the discs. In this case it is found that although the mass
distribution does not change significantly, matter caught onto highly eccentric
orbits is transported surprisingly far inside the disc. The captured mass
partly replenishes the disc, but has a much lower angular momentum. This can
lead to a reduction of the angular momentum in the entire disc and thus
considerably increased accretion shortly after the encounter as well as in the
long term.",2005-04-27T08:23:51Z
Precise reddening and metallicity of NGC6752 from FLAMES spectra,"(abridged) Accurate reddenings for Globular Clusters could be obtained by
comparing the colour-temperature obtained using temperatures from
reddening-free indicator (Halpha), with that given by standard
colour-temperature calibrations. From a single 1300 seconds exposure with
FLAMES at VLT2 we obtained spectra centred on Halpha (R=6000, 5<S/N<50) for 120
stars near the turn-off of NGC6752. This set of spectra was used to derive
effective temperatures from fittings of Halpha profiles with typical errors of
about +/- 200 K and reddening estimates with individual errors of 0.05 mag.
Averaging all individual reddenings, a high precision reddening estimate has
been obtained for the cluster: E(B-V)=0.046 +/- 0.005. The same exposure
provided UVES spectra of seven stars near the red giant branch bump (R=40000,
20<S/N<40) that provided Fe abundances with internal errors of 0.026 dex, and
with average metallicity [Fe/H]= -1.48 +/- 0.01 +/- 0.06 dex (random +
systematic). Abundances were obtained for several other elements, allowing e.g.
an accurate estimate of the ratio between the alpha-elements and Fe
([alpha/Fe]=+0.27 +/- 0.01). The O-Na anticorrelation is evident from our UVES
data, in agreement with past results. This analysis shows the power of FLAMES
for analysis of globular clusters: the accurate reddenings and metal abundances
obtained by a procedure like that described here, combined with distance
determinations from cluster dynamics or main sequence fitting, and high quality
colour-magnitude diagrams, could allow derivation of ages with errors below 1
Gyr for individual globular clusters.",2005-05-10T16:35:36Z
"Evidence for Evolution or Bias in Host Extinctions of Type 1a Supernovae
  at High Redshift","Type 1a supernova magnitudes conventionally include an additive parameter
called the extinction coefficient. We find that the extinction coefficients of
a popular ``gold'' set are well correlated with the deviation of magnitudes
from Hubble diagrams. If the effect is due to bias, extinctions have been
overestimated, which makes supernovas appear more dim. The statistical
significance of the extinction-acceleration correlation has a random chance
probability of less than one in a million. The hypothesis that extinction
coefficients should be corrected empirically provides greatly improved fits to
both accelerating and non-accelerating models, with the independent feature of
eliminating any significant correlation of residuals.",2005-06-21T03:03:28Z
The pulsed X-ray light curves of the isolated neutron star RBS1223,"We present a multi-epoch spectral and timing analysis of the isolated neutron
star RBS1223. New XMM-Newton data obtained in January 2004 confirm the spin
period to be twice as long as previously thought, P_spin = 10.31 s. The
combined ROSAT, Chandra, XMM-Newton data (6 epochs) give, contrary to earlier
findings, no clear indication of a spin evolution of the neutron star. The
X-ray light curves are double-humped with pronounced hardness ratio variations
suggesting an inhomogeneous surface temperature with two spots separated by
about ~160 degr. The sharpness of the two humps suggests a mildly relativistic
star with a ratio between R_ns, the neutron star radius at source, and r_S, the
Schwarzschild-radius, of R_ns/r_S > 3.5. Assuming Planckian energy
distributions as local radiation sources, light curves were synthesized which
were found to be in overall qualitative agreement with observed light curves in
two different energy bands. The temperature distribution used was based on the
crustal field models by Geppert et al. (2004) for a central temperature of T_c
= 10^8 K and an external dipolar field of B ~ 10^{13} G. This gives a mean
atmospheric temperature of 55 eV. A much simpler model with two homogeneous
spots with T_\infty = 92 eV, and 84 eV, and a cold rest star, T_star,\infty <
45 eV, invisible at X-ray wavelengths, was found to be similarly successful.
The new temperature determination and the new dot(P)_{spin} suggest that the
star is older than previously thought, T \simeq 10^(5..6) yrs. The
model-dependent distance to RBS1223 is estimated between 76 pc and 380 pc (for
R_ns = 12 km).",2005-05-26T15:01:53Z
"Which physical parameters can be inferred from the emission variability
  of relativistic jets?","We present results of a detailed numerical study and theoretical analysis of
the dynamics of internal shocks in relativistic jets and the non-thermal flares
associated with these shocks. In our model internal shocks result from
collisions of density inhomogeneities (shells) in relativistic jet flows. We
find that the merged shell resulting from the inelastic collision of shells has
a complicated internal structure due to the non-linear dynamics of the
interaction. Furthermore, the instantaneous efficiency for converting kinetic
energy into thermal energy is found to be almost twice as high as theoretically
expected during the period of significant emission. The Lorentz factors of the
internal shocks are correlated with the initial inertial masses of the shells.
  Because of the complexity of the non-linear evolution the merged shell
becomes very inhomogeneous and simple one-zone models are inadequate to extract
physical parameters of the emitting region from the resulting light curves. In
order to improve on these one-zone approximations, we propose a novel way of
analyzing the space-time properties of the emission. Based on these properties
we construct an analytic model of non-thermal flares which can be used to
constrain some (unobservable) physical parameters of the internal shocks. These
are the ratio of the Lorentz factors between the forward and the reverse shock
(caused by the shell collision), and the shell crossing times of these shocks.
The analytic model is validated by applying it to the synthetic light curves
computed from our models. It can equally well be applied to observations.",2005-06-27T11:43:47Z
A Sudden Gravitational Transition,"We investigate the properties of a cosmological scenario which undergoes a
gravitational phase transition at late times. In this scenario, the Universe
evolves according to general relativity in the standard, hot Big Bang picture
until a redshift z \lesssim 1. Non-perturbative phenomena associated with a
minimally-coupled scalar field catalyzes a transition, whereby an order
parameter consisting of curvature quantities such as R^2, R_{ab}R^{ab},
R_{abcd}R^{abcd} acquires a constant expectation value. The ensuing cosmic
acceleration appears driven by a dark-energy component with an
equation-of-state w < -1. We evaluate the constraints from type 1a supernovae,
the cosmic microwave background, and other cosmological observations. We find
that a range of models making a sharp transition to cosmic acceleration are
consistent with observations.",2005-07-26T20:04:41Z
Radio Detection of Extensive Air Showers with CODALEMA,"The principle and performances of the CODALEMA experimental device, set up to
study the possibility of high energy cosmic rays radio detection, are
presented. Radio transient signals associated to cosmic rays have been
identified, for which arrival directions and shower's electric field topologies
have been extracted from the antenna signals. The measured rate, about 1 event
per day, corresponds to an energy threshold around 5.10^16 eV. These results
allow to determine the perspectives offered by the present experimental design
for radiodetection of UHECR at a larger scale.",2005-07-07T07:51:19Z
2-D models of layered protoplanetary discs: I. The ring instability,"In this work we use the radiation hydrodynamic code TRAMP to perform a
two-dimensional axially symmetric model of the layered disc. Using this model
we follow the accumulation of mass in the dead zone due to the radially varying
accretion rate. We found a new type of instability which causes the dead zone
to split into rings. This ""ring instability"" works due to the positive feedback
between the thickness of the dead zone and the mass accumulation rate.
  We give an analytical description of this instability, taking into account
non-zero thickness of the dead zone and deviations from the Keplerian
rotational velocity. The analytical model agrees reasonably well with results
of numerical simulations. Finally, we speculate about the possible role of the
ring instability in protoplanetary discs and in the formation of planets.",2005-06-22T12:44:51Z
"Cassini UVIS Observations of the Io Plasma Torus. III. Observations of
  Temporal and Azimuthal Variability","In this third paper in a series presenting observations by the Cassini
Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS) of the Io plasma torus, we show
remarkable, though subtle, spatio-temporal variations in torus properties. The
Io torus is found to exhibit significant, near-sinusoidal variations in ion
composition as a function of azimuthal position. The azimuthal variation in
composition is such that the mixing ratio of S II is strongly correlated with
the mixing ratio of S III and the equatorial electron density and strongly
anti-correlated with the mixing ratios of both S IV and O II and the equatorial
electron temperature. Surprisingly, the azimuthal variation in ion composition
is observed to have a period of 10.07 hours--1.5% longer than the System III
rotation period of Jupiter, yet 1.3% shorter than the System IV period defined
by Brown (1995). Although the amplitude of the azimuthal variation of S III and
O II remained in the range of 2-5%, the amplitude of the S II and S IV
compositional variation ranged between 5-25% during the UVIS observations.
Furthermore, the amplitude of the azimuthal variations of S II and S IV appears
to be modulated by its location in System III longitude, such that when the
region of maximum S II mixing ratio (minimum S IV mixing ratio) is aligned with
a System III longitude of ~200 +/- 15 degrees, the amplitude is a factor of ~4
greater than when the variation is anti-aligned. This behavior can explain
numerous, often apparently contradictory, observations of variations in the
properties of the Io plasma torus with the System III and System IV coordinate
systems.",2005-08-01T23:20:28Z
"A Measurement of the Angular Power Spectrum of the CMB Temperature
  Anisotropy from the 2003 Flight of Boomerang","We report on observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) obtained
during the January 2003 flight of Boomerang . These results are derived from
195 hours of observation with four 145 GHz Polarization Sensitive Bolometer
(PSB) pairs, identical in design to the four 143 GHz Planck HFI polarized
pixels. The data include 75 hours of observations distributed over 1.84% of the
sky with an additional 120 hours concentrated on the central portion of the
field, itself representing 0.22% of the full sky. From these data we derive an
estimate of the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations of the CMB
in 24 bands over the multipole range (50 < l < 1500). A series of features,
consistent with those expected from acoustic oscillations in the primordial
photon-baryon fluid, are clearly evident in the power spectrum, as is the
exponential damping of power on scales smaller than the photon mean free path
at the epoch of last scattering (l > 900). As a consistency check, the
collaboration has performed two fully independent analyses of the time ordered
data, which are found to be in excellent agreement.",2005-07-21T15:06:12Z
Properties of Extremely Red Objects in an Overdense Region,"We use a serendipitously discovered overdensity of extremely red objects
(EROs) to study the morphologies and cumulative surface number density of EROs
in a dense environment. Our extremely deep imaging allows us to select very
faint EROs, reaching Ks=21, or ~2 magnitudes fainter than the L* of passively
evolving ellipticals at z=1.5. We find that the shape of the ERO cumulative
surface number density in our overdense field mimics that of the field ERO
population over all magnitudes down to Ks=21 but with a factor of 3-4 higher
normalization. The excellent seeing in our images (0.4"" in Ks and 0.6"" in R)
allows for morphological classification of the brighter (Ks<19) EROs and we
find a mix of morphologies including interacting systems and disks; the
fraction of pure bulges (at most 38%), galaxies with disks (at least 46%), and
interacting systems (at least 21%) is consistent with morphological fractions
in field ERO studies. The similarity in the shape of the cumulative surface
density and morphological mix between our overdense field and the field ERO
population suggests that ERO galaxies in overdense regions at z~1-2 may not
have had an appreciably different history than those in the field.",2005-03-23T23:24:37Z
"Long-Term Radio Modulation in Sagittarius A* from Spin-Induced Disk
  Precession","There is some evidence, though yet unconfirmed, that Sagittarius A*--the
supermassive black hole at the Galactic center--emits its radio waves modulated
with a ~100-day period. What is intriguing about this apparent
quasi-periodicity is that, though the amplitude of the modulation increases
with decreasing wavelength (from 3.6 to 1.3 cm), the quasi-period itself does
not seem to depend on the frequency of the radiation. It is difficult to
imagine how a binary companion, were that the cause of this modulation, could
have escaped detection until now. Instead, it has been suggested that the
spin-induced precession of a disk surrounding a slowly rotating black hole
could have the right period to account for this behavior. In this paper, we
examine how Sagittarius A*'s light curve could be modulated by this mechanism.
We demonstrate that the partial occultation of a nonthermal halo by a compact,
radio-opaque disk does indeed produce the observed frequency-dependent
amplitude. This appears to be in line with other observational arguments
suggesting that Sagittarius A*'s mm/sub-mm spectrum is produced by a ~10
Schwarzschild-radius disk, whereas its cm-waves originate from a nonthermal
particle distribution in a halo extending out to over 20 Schwarzschild radii.
Interestingly, this model suggests that the observed period corresponds to half
the precession period and that a non-axisymmetric disk could produce a second
period roughly twice as long as the first.",2005-05-17T20:56:32Z
The application of slim disk models to ULX: the case of M33 X-8,"A comparative XMM-Newton archival data spectral study of the ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX) M33 X-8 has been performed by using both the standard disk
model and the newly developed slim disk models. The results of this analysis
tend to confirm the hypothesis that M33 X-8 is an X-ray binary with a
stellar-mass black hole accreting at super-Eddington rate.",2005-06-14T07:42:47Z
Reply to Lyutikov's comments on Zhang & Kobayashi (2005),"Lyutikov (astro-ph/0503505) raised a valid point that for shock deceleration
of a highly magnetized outflow, the fate of the magnetic fields after shock
crossing should be considered. However, his comment that the deceleration
radius should be defined by the total energy rather than by the baryonic
kinetic energy is incorrect. As strictly derived from the shock jump conditions
in Zhang & Kobayashi (2005), during the reverse shock crossing process the
magnetic energy is not tapped. As a result, the fireball deceleration radius is
defined by the baryonic energy only. The magnetic energy is expected to be
transferred to the circumburst medium after the reverse shock disappears. The
evolution of the system then mimicks a continuously-fed fireball. As a result,
Lyutikov's naive conclusion that the forward shock dynamics is independent on
the ejecta content is also incorrect. The shock deceleration dynamics and the
reverse shock calculation presented in Zhang & Kobayashi (2005) are robust and
correct.",2005-04-19T21:12:23Z
On the large-angle anomalies of the microwave sky,"[Abridged] We apply the multipole vector framework to full-sky maps derived
from the first year WMAP data. We significantly extend our earlier work showing
that the two lowest cosmologically interesting multipoles, l=2 and 3, are not
statistically isotropic. These results are compared to the findings obtained
using related methods. In particular, the planes of the quadrupole and the
octopole are unexpectedly aligned. Moreover, the combined quadrupole plus
octopole is surprisingly aligned with the geometry and direction of motion of
the solar system: the plane they define is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane
and to the plane defined by the dipole direction, and the ecliptic plane
carefully separates stronger from weaker extrema, running within a couple of
degrees of the null-contour between a maximum and a minimum over more than
120deg of the sky. Even given the alignment of the quadrupole and octopole with
each other, we find that their alignment with the ecliptic is unlikely at >98%
C.L., and argue that it is in fact unlikely at >99.9% C.L. We explore the role
of foregrounds showing that the known Galactic foregrounds are unlikely to lead
to these correlations. Multipole vectors, like individual a_lm, are very
sensitive to sky cuts, and we demonstrate that analyses using cut skies induce
relatively large errors, thus weakening the observed correlations but
preserving their consistency with the full-sky results. Finally we apply our
tests to COBE cut-sky maps and briefly extend the analysis to higher
multipoles. If the correlations we observe are indeed a signal of non-cosmic
origin, then the lack of low-l power will very likely be exacerbated, with
important consequences for our understanding of cosmology on large scales.",2005-08-01T20:07:39Z
A Merger-Driven Scenario for Cosmological Disk Galaxy Formation,"(Abridged) The violent hierarchical nature of the LCDM cosmology poses
serious difficulties for the formation of disk galaxies. To help resolve these
issues, we describe a new, merger-driven scenario for the cosmological
formation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements the standard
model based on dissipational collapse.In this picture, large gaseous disks may
be produced from high-angular momentum mergers of systems that are
gas-dominated, i.e. M_gas/(M_gas +M_star > 0.5 at the height of the merger.
Pressurization from the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium
prevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and if
enough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a disk
galaxy. We perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study how
supernovae feedback strength, supermassive black hole growth and feedback,
progenitor gas fraction, merger mass-ratio, and orbital geometry impact the
formation of remnant disks. We find that disks can build angular momentum
through mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in the
merger remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with star
formation. Disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that are
gas-dominated at the time of final coalescence and gas-dominated mergers
typically require extreme progenitor gas fractions (>80%). We also show that
the formation of rotationally-supported stellar systems in mergers is not
restricted to idealized orbits, or major or minor mergers. We suggest that the
hierarchical nature of the LCDM cosmology and the physics of the interstellar
gas may act together to form spiral galaxies by building the angular momentum
of disks through early, gas-dominated mergers.",2005-03-16T21:01:18Z
"Constraints on the dark energy equation of state from the imprint of
  baryons on the power spectrum of clusters","Acoustic oscillations in the baryon-photon fluid leave a signature in the
matter power spectrum. The overall shape of the spectrum and the wavelength of
the oscillations depend upon the sound horizon scale at recombination. Using
the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter Hubble Volume simulation, we show that the
imprint of baryons is visible in the power spectrum of cluster-mass dark matter
haloes, in spite of significant differences between the halo power spectrum and
the prediction of linear perturbation theory. A measurement of the sound
horizon scale can constrain the dark energy equation of state. We show that a
survey of clusters at intermediate redshift ($ z\sim1 $), like the
Sunyaev-Zeldovich survey proposed by the South Pole Telescope or a red sequence
photometric survey with VISTA, could potentially constrain the sound horizon
scale to an accuracy of $\sim 2%$, in turn fixing the ratio of the pressure of
the dark energy to its density ($w$) to better than $\sim 10%$. Our approach
does not require knowledge of the cluster mass, unlike those that depend upon
the abundance of clusters.",2005-04-21T13:46:03Z
Bars and Cold Dark Matter Halos,"The central part of a dark matter halo reacts to the presence and evolution
of a bar. Not only does the halo absorb angular momentum from the disk, it can
also be compressed and have its shape modified. We study these issues in a
series of cosmologically motivated, highly resolved N-body simulations of
barred galaxies run under different initial conditions. In all models we find
that the inner halo's central density increases. We model this density increase
using the standard adiabatic approximation and the modified formula by Gnedin
et al. and find that halo mass profiles are better reproduced by this latter.
In models with a strong bar, the dark matter in the central region forms a
bar-like structure (``dark matter bar''), which rotates together with the
normal bar formed by the stellar component (``stellar bar''). The
minor-to-major axial ratio of a halo bar changes with radius with a typical
value 0.7 in the central disk region. DM bar amplitude is mostly a function of
the stellar bar strength. Models in which the bar amplitude increases or stays
roughly constant with time, initially large (40%-60%) misalignment between the
halo and disk bars quickly decreases with time as the bar grows. The halo bar
is nearly aligned with the stellar bar (~10 degrees lag for the halo) after ~2
Gyr. The torque, which the halo bar exerts on the stellar bar, can serve as a
mechanism to regulate the angular momentum transfer from the disk to the halo.",2005-06-26T23:05:07Z
"Estimating the Porosity of the Interstellar Medium from
  Three-Dimensional Photoionization Modeling of H II Regions","We apply our three dimensional photoionization code to model Wisconsin
H-alpha Mapper observations of the H II region surrounding the O9.5V star Zeta
Oph. Our models investigate the porosity of the interstellar medium around zeta
Oph and the effects of 3D densities on the H-alpha surface brightness and
variation in the [N II]/H-alpha line ratio. The Zeta Oph H II region has a well
characterized ionizing source, so it is an excellent starting point for 3D
models of diffuse ionized gas. We investigate various hierarchically clumped
density structures, varying the overall smoothness within the clumping
algorithm. By simulating the observations, we can estimate the porosity of the
medium in the vicinity of Zeta Oph and find that within the context of our
hierarchically clumped models, around 50% to 80% of the volume is occupied by
clumps surrounded by a low density smooth medium. We also conclude that in
order for O stars to ionize the diffuse Warm Ionized Medium, the O star
environment must be more porous than that surrounding Zeta Oph, with clumps
occupying less than one half of the interstellar volume. Our clumpy models have
irregular boundaries, similar to observed H II regions. However, in observed H
II regions it is difficult to identify the precise location of the boundary
because of the foreground and/or background emission from the widespread Warm
Ionized Medium. This complicates the interpretation of the predicted rapid rise
of some emission line ratios near the edge of uniform density H II regions and
combined with the three dimensional clumpy nature of the interstellar medium
may explain the apparent lack of distinctive emission line ratios near H I -- H
II interfaces.",2005-06-15T12:01:23Z
Black Hole States: Accretion and Jet Ejection,"The complex spectral and timing properties of the high-energy emission from
the accretion flow in black-hole binaries, together with their strong
connection to the ejection of powerful relativistic jets from the system, can
be simplified and reduced to four basic states: hard, hard-intermediate,
soft-intermediate and soft. Unlike other classifications, these states are
based on the presence of sharp state transitions. I summarize this
classification and discuss the relation between these states and the physical
components contributing to the emitted flux.",2005-04-07T17:23:00Z
Detectability of Cosmic Topology in Generalized Chaplygin Gas Models,"If the spatial section of the universe is multiply connected, repeated images
or patterns are expected to be detected observationally. However, due to the
finite distance to the last scattering surface, such pattern repetitions could
be unobservable. This raises the question of whether a given cosmic topology is
detectable, depending on the values of the parameters of the cosmological
model. We study how detectability is affected by the choice of the model itself
for the matter-energy content of the universe, focusing our attention on the
generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model for dark matter and dark energy
unification, and investigate how the detectability of cosmic topology depends
on the GCG parameters. We determine to what extent a number of topologies are
detectable for the current observational bounds on these parameters. It emerges
from our results that the choice of GCG as an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM
matter-energy content model has an impact on the detectability of cosmic
topology.",2005-06-21T17:54:26Z
"Three active M dwarfs within 8 pc: L 449-1, L 43-72, & LP 949-15","Three nearby star candidates were selected as bright 2MASS point sources
without associated optical sources, i.e. with potentially large proper motions,
subsequently confirmed by multi-epoch optical data from the SuperCOSMOS Sky
Surveys. All three objects are listed in the NLTT catalogue of high proper
motion stars. Follow-up spectroscopic observations allowed us to classify L
449-1 as M4.0e dwarf at 5.7 pc, L43-72 as M4.5e dwarf at 7.2 pc, and LP 949-15
as M5.0e dwarf at 6.1 pc, using known absolute $JHK_\mathrm{s}$ magnitudes of
dwarfs with corresponding spectral types, respectively. All three stars exhibit
$H{\alpha}$ emission lines, and all three can be identified with bright X-ray
sources. The available ROSAT light curves of two of the objects show typical
flare-like variability. Thus, all three stars are active, very close potential
neighbours of the Sun, previously not mentioned as such, certainly deserving
further attention. In particular, these are very promising candidates for
trigonometric parallax programs.",2005-05-12T08:01:46Z
Discovery of Pulsed OH Maser Emission Stimulated by a Pulsar,"Stimulated emission of radiation has not been directly observed in
astrophysical situations up to this time. Here we demonstrate that photons from
pulsar B1641-45 stimulate pulses of excess 1720 MHz line emission in an
interstellar OH cloud. As this stimulated emission is driven by the pulsar, it
varies on a few millisecond timescale, orders of magnitude shorter than the
quickest OH maser variations previously detected.
  Our 1612 MHz spectra are inverted copies of the 1720 MHz spectra. This
""conjugate line"" phenomenon enables us to constrain the properties of the
interstellar OH line-producing gas.
  We also show that pulsar signals suffer significantly deeper OH absorption
than do other background sources; confirming earlier tentative findings that OH
clouds are clumpier on small scales than neutral hydrogen clouds.",2005-05-11T13:44:52Z
Forced oscillations in magnetized accretion disks and QPOs,"We propose a new model for these QPOs based on forced oscillations induced in
the accretion disk due to the stellar magnetic field.
  First, it is shown that a magnetized accretion disk evolving in a rotating
nonaxisymmetric magnetic field anchored to a neutron star will be subject to
three kinds of resonances: a corotation resonance, a Lindblad resonance due to
a driving force, and a parametric resonance due to the time varying epicyclic
frequencies. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the linear response
of a thin accretion disk, developing the density perturbation as the sum of
free wave solutions and non-wavelike disturbances. In the last part, we show
results of 2D numerical simulations of a simplified version of the accretion
disk consisting of a column of plasma threaded by a vertical magnetic field. It
is argued that the nearly periodic motion induced in the disk will produce high
quality factor QPOs.",2005-07-06T11:30:28Z
"The Redshift Distribution of Distant Supernovae and its Use in Probing
  Reionization","We model the number of detectable supernovae (SNe) as a function of redshift
at different flux thresholds, making use of the observed properties of local
SNe, such as their lightcurves, fiducial spectra, and peak magnitude
distributions. We obtain a rate of 0.4-2.3 SNe/arcmin^2/yr at z > 5 at the near
infrared (4.5 micron) flux density threshold of 3 nJy (achievable with the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in a 10^5 s integration). In a hypothetical
one-year survey, it should be possible to detect up to several thousand SNe per
unit redshift at z > 6. We discuss the possible application of such a large
sample of distant SNe as a probe of the epoch of reionization. By heating the
intergalactic medium and raising the cosmological Jeans mass, the process of
reionization can suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies. This could have
produced a relatively sharp drop in the SNR around the redshift of
reionization. We quantify the detectability of this feature in future surveys
of distant SNe by varying the redshift and duration of the feature, as well as
its impact on the SFR in low-mass halos, which results in different redshifts,
widths, and sizes of the drop in the expected SFR. We find that the drop can be
detected out to z_re ~ 13, as long as (i) the reionization history contains a
relatively rapid feature which is synchronized over different regions to within
\Delta z < 1 - 3, (ii) the star-formation efficiency in halos that dominate
reionization is ~ 10%, and (iii) reionization significantly suppresses the star
formation in low-mass halos. Depending on the details of (i) - (iii), this
could be achieved with a survey lasting less than two weeks. Detecting this
signature would also help elucidate the feedback mechanism that regulates
reionization.",2005-05-06T19:50:00Z
Interpreting Cosmological Vacuum Decay,"The cosmological vacuum decay scenario recently proposed by Wang and Meng
\cite{wm} is rediscussed. From thermodynamic arguments it is found that the
$\epsilon$ parameter quantifying the vacuum decay rate must be positive in the
presence of particle creation. If there is no particle creation, the proper
mass of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particles is necessarily a time dependent
quantity, scaling as $m(t) = m_o a(t)^{\epsilon}$. By considering the presence
of baryons in the cosmological scenario, it is also shown that their dynamic
effect is to alter the transition redshift $z_*$ (the redshift at which the
Universe switches from decelerating to accelerating expansion), predicting
values of $z_*$ compatible with current estimates based on type Ia supernova.
In order to constrain the $\Omega_m - \epsilon$ plane, a joint statistical
analysis involving the current supernovae observations, gas mass fraction
measurements in galaxy clusters and CMB data is performed. At 95% c.l. it is
found that the vacuum decay rate parameter lies on the interval $\epsilon =
0.11 \pm 0.12$). The possibility of a vacuum decay into photons is also
analyzed. In this case, the energy density of the radiation fluid scales as
$\rho_r = \rho_{ro}a^{-4 + \epsilon}$, and its temperature evolution law obeys
$T(t) = T_oa(t)^{\epsilon/4 - 1}$.",2005-07-15T13:05:10Z
"Radio pulsars around intermediate mass black holes in super stellar
  clusters","We study accretion in binaries hosting an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH)
of 1000 solar masses, and a donor star more massive than 15 solar masses. These
systems experience an active X-ray phase characterized by luminosities varying
over a wide interval, from <10^36 erg/s up to a few 10^40 erg/s typical of the
ultra luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Roche lobe overflow on the zero-age main
sequence and donor masses above 20 solar masses can maintain a long-lived
accretion phase at the level required to feed a ULX source. In wide systems,
wind transfer rates are magnified by the focusing action of the IMBH yielding
wind luminosities around 10^38 erg/s. These high mass-IMBH binaries can be
identified as progenitors of IMBH-radio pulsar (PSR) binaries. We find that the
formation of an IMBH-PSR binary does not necessarely require the transit
through a ULX phase, but that a ULX can highlight a system that will evolve
into an IMBH-PSR, if the mass of the donor star is constrained to lie within 15
to 30 solar masses. We show that binary evolution delivers the pre-exploding
helium core in an orbit such that after explosion, the neutron star has a very
high probability to remain bound to the IMBH, at distances of 1-10 AU. The
detection of an IMBH-PSR binary in the Milky Way has suffered, so far, from the
same small number of statistics limit affecting the population of ULXs in our
Galaxy. Ongoing deeper surveys or next generation radio telescopes like SKA
will have an improved chance to unveil such intriguing systems. Timing analysis
of a pulsar orbiting around an IMBH would weigh the black hole in the still
uncharted interval of mass around 1000 solar masses",2005-07-09T21:30:35Z
"Is it possible to tell the difference between fermionic and bosonic hot
  dark matter?","We study the difference between thermally produced fermionic and bosonic hot
dark matter in detail. In the linear regime of structure formation, their
distinct free-streaming behaviours can lead to pronounced differences in the
matter power spectrum. While not detectable with current cosmological data,
such differences will be clearly observable with upcoming large scale weak
lensing surveys for particles as light as m_HDM ~ 0.2 eV. In the nonlinear
regime, bosonic hot dark matter is not subject to the same phase space
constraints that severely limit the amount of fermionic hot dark matter infall
into cold dark matter halos. Consequently, the overdensities in fermionic and
bosonic hot dark matter of equal particle mass can differ by more than a factor
of five in the central part of a halo. However, this unique manifestation of
quantum statistics may prove very difficult to detect unless the mass of the
hot dark matter particle and its decoupling temperature fall within a very
narrow window, 1 < m_HDM/eV < 4 and g* < 30. In this case, hot dark matter
infall may have some observable consequences for the nonlinear power spectrum
and hence the weak lensing convergence power spectrum at l ~ 10^3 - 10^4 at the
percent level.",2005-07-22T17:55:51Z
Measuring the evolution of the most stable optical clock G 117-B15A,"We report our measurement of the rate of change of period with time dP/dt for
the 215 s periodicity in the pulsating white dwarf G 117-B15A, the most stable
optical clock known. After 31 years of observations, we have finally obtained a
4 sigma measurement dP/dt_observed = (4.27 +/- 0.80) x 10^{-15} s/s. Taking
into account the proper-motion effect of dP/dt_pm = (7.0 +/- 2.0) x 10^{-16}
s/s, we obtain a rate of change of period with time of dP/dt = (3.57 +/- 0.82)
x 10^{-15} s/s. This value is consistent with the cooling rate in our white
dwarf models only for cores of C or C/O. With the refinement of the models, the
observed rate of period change can be used to accurately measure the ratio of
C/O in the core of the white dwarf.",2005-07-20T19:47:44Z
"New multi-zoom method for N-body simulations: application to galaxy
  growth by accretion","In this work we focus on the properties of accretion onto galaxies. Through
numerical simulations we investigate the geometrical properties of accretion.
To span the scale range required in these simulations we have developed a new
numerical technique: the multi-zoom method. We run a series of Tree-SPH
simulations in smaller and smaller boxes at higher and higher mass resolution,
using data recorded at the previous level to account for the matter inflow and
the tidal field from outside matter. The code is parallelized using OpenMP. We
present a validation test to evaluate the robustness of the method: the pancake
collapse. We apply this new multizoom method to study the accretion properties.
Zooming in onto galaxies from a cosmological simulation, we select a sample of
10 well resolved galaxies (5000 baryonic particles or more). We sum up their
basic properties and plot a Tully-Fisher relation. We find that smooth
accretion of intergalactic cold gas dominates mergers for the mass growth of
galaxies at z < 2. Next we study the baryonic accretion rate which shows
different behaviours depending on the galaxy mass. The bias is also computed at
different radii and epochs. Then we present galactocentric angular maps for the
accretion integrated between z=2 and z=0, which reveal that accretion is highly
anisotropic. Average accretion rates plotted against galactocentric latitude
show a variety of behaviours. In general, accretion in the galactic plane is
favored, even more for baryonic matter than for dark matter.",2005-06-24T12:32:22Z
"The broad-band X-ray spectrum of the blazar PKS B1830-211 by Chandra and
  INTEGRAL","In this paper we present a broad-band study of the X-ray emission of the
blazar PKS1830-211 based on Chandra and Integral observations. Notwithstanding
the high redshift (z=2.507), it is a bright X-ray source (F(2-10 keV)~10^{-11}
erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}), due to gravitational lensing by an intervening galaxy at
z=0.89. Previous X-ray observations attribute the observed absorption at E<2
keV to the lensing galaxy. Our analysis, although not in contrast with this
hypothesis, suggests also the possibility of an intrinsic (ionized) absorption,
taking place at the front side of the jet. This scenario is also supported by
some evidence, in the same data, of a feature observed at 2.15 keV which can be
interpreted as a blueshifted iron line (v/c ~ 0.18). The SED of PKS1830-211 can
be well modelled by combining a Synchrotron Self-Compton component and an
external source of photons to be scattered up to \gamma-ray energies by
relativistic electrons moving outward in the jet. The main source of low energy
photons is a dust torus at the temperature of 10^3 K as expected in MeV
blazars.",2005-04-06T10:10:28Z
GRB050223: A faint Gamma-Ray Burst discovered by Swift,"GRB050223 was discovered by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer on 23 February
2005 and was the first Gamma-Ray Burst to be observed by both Swift and
XMM-Newton. At the time of writing (May 2005), it has one of the faintest GRB
afterglows ever observed. The spacecraft could not slew immediately to the
burst, so the first X-ray and optical observations occurred approximately 45
minutes after the trigger. Although no optical emission was found by any
instrument, both Swift and XMM-Newton detected the fading X-ray afterglow.
Combined data from both of these observatories show the afterglow to be fading
monotonically as 0.99 +0.15/-0.12 over a time frame between 45 minutes to 27
hours post-burst. Spectral analysis, allowed largely by the higher through-put
of XMM-Newton, implies a power-law with a slope of Gamma=1.75 +0.19/-0.18 and
shows no evidence for absorption above the Galactic column of 7 x 10^20 cm^-2.
  From the X-ray decay and spectral slopes, a low electron power-law index of p
= 1.3-1.9 is derived; the slopes also imply that a jet-break has not occured up
to 27 hours after the burst. The faintness of GRB050223 may be due to a large
jet opening or viewing angle or a high redshift.",2005-07-30T15:24:18Z
"Search for Extra-Terrestrial planets: The DARWIN mission - Target Stars
  and Array Architectures","The DARWIN mission is an Infrared free flying interferometer mission based on
the new technique of nulling interferometry. Its main objective is to detect
and characterize other Earth-like planets, analyze the composition of their
atmospheres and their capability to sustain life, as we know it. DARWIN is
currently in definition phase. This PhD work that has been undertaken within
the DARWIN team at the European Space Agency (ESA) addresses two crucial
aspects of the mission. Firstly, a DARWIN target star list has been established
that includes characteristics of the target star sample that will be critical
for final mission design, such as, luminosity, distance, spectral
classification, stellar variability, multiplicity, location and radius of the
star. Constrains were applied as set by planet evolution theory and mission
architecture. Secondly, a number of alternative mission architectures have been
evaluated on the basis of interferometer response as a function of wavelength,
achievable modulation efficiency, number of telescopes and starlight rejection
capabilities. The study has shown that the core mission goals should be
achievable with a lower level of complexity as compared to the current baseline
configuration.",2005-04-22T12:39:07Z
"Deep Echelle Spectrophotometry of S 311, a galactic H II Region Outside
  the Solar Circle","We present echelle spectrophotometry of the Galactic H II region S 311. The
data have been taken with the Very Large Telescope UVES echelle spectrograph in
the 3100 to 10400 angstroms range. We have measured the intensities of 263
emission lines, 178 are permitted lines of H0, D0 (deuterium), He0, C0, C+, N0,
N+, O0, O+, S+, Si0, Si+, Ar0 and Fe0; some of them are produced by
recombination and others mainly by fluorescence. Physical conditions have been
derived using different continuum and line intensity ratios. We have derived
He+, C++ and O++ ionic abundances from pure recombination lines as well as
abundances from collisionally excited lines for a large number of ions of
different elements. We have obtained consistent estimations of t2 applying
different methods. We have found that the temperature fluctuations paradigm is
consistent with the t2(He I) vs. t2(H I) relation for H II regions, in contrast
with what has been found for planetary nebulae. We report the detection of
deuterium Balmer lines up to D6 in the blue wings of the hydrogen lines, which
excitation mechanism seems to be continuum fluorescence.",2005-06-17T12:52:59Z
"Discovery of new quasi-periodic oscillations in the X-ray transient
  source V~0332+53","We report the discovery of a new quasi-period oscillation (QPO) at 0.22 Hz,
centered on the source spin frequency of the high mass X-ray binary system
V~0332+53 when the source was observed during its November 2004/March 2005
outburst by {\em RXTE}. Besides this new QPO, we also detected the known 0.05
Hz QPO. Both the 0.22 and 0.05 Hz QPOs stand out clearly at a mid-flux level of
the outburst within January 15--19 2005, and later at an even lower flux level
as the width of 0.22 Hz QPO drops. No evolution of the centroid frequency with
the flux is seen in either QPO. The rms value below 10 keV is around 4--6% for
both QPOs and decreases at higher energies. We discuss our results in the
context of current QPO models.",2005-07-01T02:49:58Z
Early star formation in the Galaxy from beryllium and oxygen abundances,"We investigate the evolution of the star formation rate in the early Galaxy
using beryllium and oxygen abundances in metal poor stars. Specifically, we
show that stars belonging to two previously identified kinematical classes (the
so-called ``accretion'' and ``dissipative'' populations) are neatly separated
in the [O/Fe] vs. Log(Be/H) diagram. The dissipative population follows the
predictions of our model of Galactic evolution for the thick disk component,
suggesting that the formation of this stellar population occurred on a
timescale significantly longer (by a factor ~5-10) than the accretion
component. The latter shows a large scatter in the [O/Fe] vs. Log(Be/H)
diagram, probably resulting from the inhomogeneous enrichment in oxygen and
iron of the protogalactic gas. Despite the limitation of the sample, the data
suggest that the combined use of products of spallation reactions (like
beryllium) and elemental ratios of stellar nucleosynthesis products (like
[O/Fe]) can constrain theoretical models for the formation and early evolution
of our Galaxy.",2005-05-19T07:41:32Z
"Growth of Hydrodynamic Perturbations in Accretion Disks: Possible Route
  to Non-Magnetic Turbulence","We study the possible origin of hydrodynamic turbulence in cold accretion
disks such as those in star-forming systems and quiescent cataclysmic
variables. As these systems are expected to have neutral gas, the turbulent
viscosity is likely to be hydrodynamic in origin, not magnetohydrodynamic.
Therefore MRI will be sluggish or even absent in such disks. Although there are
no exponentially growing eigenmodes in a hydrodynamic disk, because of the
non-normal nature of the eigenmodes, a large transient growth in the energy is
still possible, which may enable the system to switch to a turbulent state. For
a Keplerian disk, we estimate that the energy will grow by a factor of 1000 for
a Reynolds number close to a million.",2005-07-02T01:53:08Z
"The 1 - 50 keV spectral and timing analysis of IGR J18027-2016: an
  eclipsing, high mass X-ray binary","We report the association of the INTEGRAL source IGR J18027-2016 with the
BeppoSAX source SAX J1802.7-2017. IGR J18027-2016 is seen to be a weak,
persistent source by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board INTEGRAL with an
average source count rate of 0.55 counts s^-1 (~6.1 mCrab) in the 20-40 keV
band. Timing analysis performed on the ISGRI data identifies an orbital period
of 4.5696 +/- 0.0009 days and gives an ephemeris of mid-eclipse as, T{mid} =
52931.37 +/- 0.04 MJD. Re-analysis of archival BeppoSAX data has provided a
mass function for the donor star, f(m) = 16 +/- 1 M{sun} and a projected
semimajor axis of a{x}sin{i} = 68 +/- 1 lt-s. We conclude that the donor is an
OB-supergiant with a mass of 18.8-29.3 M{sun} and a radius of 15.0-23.4 R{sun}.
Spectra obtained by XMM-Newton and ISGRI indicate a high hydrogen column
density of NH = 6.8 x 10^22 cm^-2, which suggests intrinsic absorption. The
source appears to be a high mass X-ray binary with the neutron star emitting
X-rays through wind-fed accretion while in an eclipsing orbit around an
OB-supergiant.",2005-05-04T17:13:36Z
"The Structure and Star Formation History of Early-Type Galaxies in the
  UDF/GRAPES Survey","We present a two-pronged approach to the formation of early-type galaxies,
using a sample of 18 galaxies at 0.5 < z < 1 from the HST/ACS Ultra Deep Field
and GRAPES surveys: 1) We combine slitless low resolution spectroscopy from the
GRAPES dataset with simple models of galaxy formation to explore their star
formation histories. 2) We also perform an analysis of their surface brightness
distribution with the unprecedented details provided by the ACS superb angular
resolution and photometric depth. Our spectroscopic analysis reveals that their
stellar populations are rather homogeneous in age and metallicity and formed at
redshifts z ~ 2-5. Evolving them passively, they become practically
indistinguishable from ellipticals at z = 0. Also, their isophotal shapes
appear very similar to those observed for nearby ellipticals, in that the
percentages of disky and boxy galaxies at z ~ 1 are close to the values
measured at z = 0. Moreover,we find that the isophotal structure of z ~ 1
early-type galaxies obeys the correlations already observed among nearby
ellipticals, i.e. disky ellipticals have generally higher characteristic
ellipticities, and boxy ellipticals have larger half-light radii and are
brighter in the restframe B band. In this respect then, no significant
structural differences are seen for ellipticals between z = 0 and 1.",2005-04-12T08:52:02Z
"Modeling the Physical Structure of the Low Density Pre-protostellar Core
  Lynds 1498","Lynds 1498 is a pre-protostellar core (PPC) and was one of the initial
objects toward which molecular depletion and differentiation was detected.
Despite the considerable scrutiny of L1498, there has not been a extensive
study of the density and temperature structure as derived from radiative
transfer modeling of dust continuum observations. We present deep SCUBA
observations of L1498 at 850 and 450 micron, high resolution BEARS maps of the
N2H+ 1-0 transition, CSO observations of the N2H+ 3-2 transition, and GBT
observations of the C3S 4-3 transition. We also present a comparison of derived
properties between L1498 and nearby PPCs that have been observed at
far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. We present a more realistic
treatment of PPC heating which varies the strength of the ISRF, Sisrf, and
includes attenuation of the ISRF due to dust grains at the outer radius of the
core, Av. The best-fitted model consists of a Bonner-Ebert sphere with a
central density of 1 - 3 x 10^4 cm-3, R_o ~ 0.29 pc, 0.5 <= Sisrf <= 1, Av ~ 1
mag, and a nearly isothermal temperature profile of ~ 10.5 K for OH8 opacities.
C3S emission shows a central depletion hole while N2H+ emission is centrally
peaked. The observed depletions of C3S and H2CO, the modest N2H+ abundance, and
a central density that is an order of magnitude lower than other modeled PPCs
suggests that L1498 may be a forming PPC. Our derived temperature and density
profile will improve modeling of molecular line observations that will
explicate the core's kinematical and chemical state. (abridged)",2005-05-09T19:10:42Z
"Eclipsing binaries in the Galactic Bulge: candidates for distance
  estimates","The 222~000 I-band light curves of variable stars detected by the OGLE-II
survey in the direction of the Galactic Bulge have been searched for eclipsing
binaries (EBs). A previously developed code to analyze lightcurve shapes and
identify long period variables (LPVs) has been adapted to identify EBs. The
parameters in the modified code have been optimised to recover a list of about
140 detached EBs in the Small Magellanic Cloud previously identified in the
literature as particularly well suited for distance estimates (and wich have
periods \more 0.85 days). The power of the code is demonstrated by identifying
16 and 178 previously uncatalogued EBs in the SMC and LMC, respectively. Among

been identified. Periods and phased lightcurves are presented.",2005-05-06T14:08:32Z
The Effect of Thermal Conduction on the Virgo Cluster,"Thermal conduction has been suggested as a possible mechanism by which
sufficient energy is supplied to the central regions of galaxy clusters to
balance the effect of radiative cooling. Here we present the results of a
simulated, high-resolution, 3-d Virgo cluster for different values of thermal
conductivity (1, 1/10, 1/100, 0 times the full Spitzer value). Starting from an
initially isothermal cluster atmosphere we allow the cluster to evolve freely
over timescales of roughly $ 1.3-4.7 \times 10^{9} $ yrs. Our results show that
thermal conductivity at the Spitzer value can increase the central ICM
radiative cooling time by a factor of roughly 3.6. In addition, for larger
values of thermal conductvity the simulated temperature and density profiles
match the observations significantly better than for the lower values. However,
no physically meaningful value of thermal conductivity was able to postpone the
cooling catastrophe (characterised by a rapid increase in the central density)
for longer than a fraction of the Hubble time nor explain the absence of a
strong cooling flow in the Virgo cluster today. We also calculate the effective
adiabatic index of the cluster gas for both simulation and observational data
and compare the values with theoretical expectations. Using this method it
appears that the Virgo cluster is being heated in the cluster centre by a
mechanism other than thermal conductivity. Based on this and our simulations it
is also likely that the thermal conductvity is suppressed by a factor of at
least 10 and probably more. Thus, we suggest that thermal conductvity, if
present at all, has the effect of slowing down the evolution of the ICM, by
radiative cooling, but only by a factor of a few.",2005-07-19T16:38:22Z
Relativistic Models of Galaxies,"A special form of the isotropic metric in cylindrical coordinates is used to
construct what may be interpreted as the General Relativistic versions of some
wellknown potential-density pairs used in Newtonian gravity to model
three-dimensional distributions of matter in galaxies. The components of the
energy-momentum tensor are calculated for the first two Miyamoto-Nagai
potentials and a particular potential due to Satoh. The three potentials yield
distributions of matter in which all tensions are pressures and all energy
conditions are satisfied for certain ranges of the free parameters. A few
non-planar geodesic orbits are computed for one of the potentials and compared
with the Newtonian case. Rotation is also incorporated to the models and the
effects of the source rotation on the rotation profile are calculated as first
order corrections by using an approximate form of the Kerr metric in isotropic
coordinates.",2005-07-18T13:34:50Z

  Without Dark Matter","We describe the universe as a local, inhomogeneous spherical bubble embedded
in a flat matter dominated FLRW universe. Generalized exact Friedmann equations
describe the expansion of the universe and an early universe inflationary de
Sitter solution is obtained. A non-perturbative expression for the deceleration
parameter q is derived that can possibly describe the acceleration of the
universe without dark energy, due to the effects associated with very long wave

From Neutron Star Binaries to Gamma-ray bursts,"I summarize recent results about how a neutron star binary coalescence can
produce short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Two possibilities are discussed: the
annihilation of neutrino anti-neutrino pairs above the merged remnant and the
exponential amplification of magnetic fields in the central object up to values
close to equipartition. We find that the neutrino annihilation drives bipolar,
relativistic outflows with Lorentz-factors large enough to circumvent the GRB
'compactness problem'. The total energy within these outflows is moderate by
GRB-standards ($\sim 10^{48}-10^{49}$ ergs), but the interaction with the
baryonic material blown-off by the neutrinos collimates the outflows into
opening angles of typically 0.1 sterad, yielding isotropic energies close to
$10^{51}$ ergs. We further want to stress the plausibility of the central
object resisting the immediate collapse to a black hole. In this case the
central object will --similar to a proto-neutron star-- be subject to neutrino
driven convection that --together with the rapid, differential rotation-- will
lead to a drastic amplification of pre-existing magnetic fields. Within
fractions of a second, field strengths comparable to equipartition field
strength ($> 10^{17}$ G) will be reached. These will produce large torques that
will spin-down the object within about 0.2 s, and would thus naturally explain
the duration of short GRBs.",2005-04-17T17:16:07Z
"On the Limb Darkening, Spectral Energy Distribution, and Temperature
  Structure of Procyon","We have fit synthetic visibilities from 3-D (CO5BOLD + PHOENIX) and 1-D
(PHOENIX, ATLAS 12) model stellar atmospheres of Procyon (F5 IV) to
high-precision interferometric data from the VLTI Interferometer (K-band) and
from the Mark III interferometer (500 nm and 800 nm). These data sets provide a
test of theoretical wavelength dependent limb-darkening predictions. The work
of Allende Prieto et al. has shown that the temperature structure from a
spatially and temporally averaged 3-D hydrodynamical model produces
significantly less limb darkening at 500 nm relative to the temperature
structure of a 1-D MARCS model atmosphere with a standard mixing-length
approximation for convection. Our direct fits to the interferometric data
confirm this prediction. A 1-D ATLAS 12 model with ``approximate overshooting''
provides the required temperature gradient. We show, however, that 1-D models
cannot reproduce the ultraviolet spectrophotometry below 160 nm with effective
temperatures in the range constrained by the measured bolometric flux and
angular diameter. We find that a good match to the full spectral energy
distribution can be obtained with a composite model consisting of a weighted
average of twelve 1-D model atmospheres based on the surface intensity
distribution of a 3-D granulation simulation. We emphasize that 1-D models with
overshooting may realistically represent the mean temperature structure of

observed because they lack the multicomponent temperature distribution expected
for the surfaces of these stars.",2005-07-14T03:45:48Z
"Dust Scattering in Miras R Car and RR Sco resolved by optical
  interferometric polarimetry","We present optical interferometric polarimetry measurements of the Mira-like
variables R Car and RR Sco, using the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer.
By making visibility measurements in two perpendicular polarisations, the
relatively low-surface brightness light scattered by atmospheric dust could be
spatially separated from the bright Mira photospheric flux. This is the first
reported successful use of long-baseline optical interferometric polarimetry.
Observations were able to place constraints on the distribution of
circumstellar material in R Car and RR Sco. The inner radius of dust formation
for both stars was found to be less than 3 stellar radii: much closer than the
expected innermost stable location for commonly-assumed astrophysical ``dirty
silicate'' dust in these systems (silicate dust with a significant iron
content). A model with the dust distributed over a shell which is geometrically
thin compared to the stellar radius was preferred over an outflow. We propose
dust components whose chemistry and opacity properties enable survival at these
extreme inner radii.",2005-05-06T01:29:26Z
"A Detailed Study of Molecular Clouds toward the TeV Gamma-Ray SNR
  G347.3-0.5","We present a detailed study of molecular gas toward the supernovae remnant
G347.3-0.5 (J1713.7-3946) obtained with the 4m mm/sub-mm telescope NANTEN .
This study has revealed that several intensity peaks and the overall
distribution of the molecular gas with radial velocities from -12 km s-1 to -3
km s-1 show a remarkably good correlation with the X-ray features, strongly
supporting the kinematic distance ~ 1 kpc derived by Fukui et al. (2003), as
opposed to 6 kpc previously claimed. In addition, we show that absorption of
X-rays is caused by local molecular gas at softer X-ray bands. Subsequent
measurements of the CO(J=3-2) made with the ASTE 10 m and CSO 10.4 m telescopes
toward the molecular intensity peaks have revealed higher excitation
conditions, most likely higher temperatures above ~ 30 K as compared to that of
the typical gas in low mass dark clouds. This is most likely caused by enhanced
heating by the high energy events in the SNR, where possible mechanisms include
heating by X-rays, gamma-rays, and/or cosmic ray protons, although we admit
additional radiative heating by young protostars embedded may be working as
well. In one of the CO peaks, we have confirmed the presence of broad molecular
wings of ~ 20 km s-1 velocity extent in the CO(J=3-2) transition. The SNR
evolution is well explained as the free expansion phase based on the distance
of 1 kpc.",2005-06-21T12:40:11Z
Interstellar Isomers: The Importance of Bonding Energy Differences,"We present strong detections of methyl cyanide, vinyl cyanide, ethyl cyanide
and cyanodiacetylene molecules with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) toward the
Sgr B2(N) molecular cloud. Attempts to detect the corresponding isocyanide
isomers were only successful in the case of methyl isocyanide for its
J(K)=1(0)-0(0) transition, which is the first interstellar report of this line.
To determine the spatial distribution of methyl isocyanide, we used archival
Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array data for the J(K)=4(K)-3(K)
(K=0-3) transitions but no emission was detected. From ab initio calculations,
the bonding energy difference between the cyanide and isocyanide molecules is
>8500 cm^-1 (>12,000 K). That we detect methyl isocyanide emission with a
single antenna (Gaussian beamsize(Omega_B)=1723 arcsec^2) but not with an
interferometer (Omega_B=192 arcsec^2), strongly suggests that methyl isocyanide
has a widespread spatial distribution toward the Sgr B2(N) region. Thus,
large-scale, non-thermal processes in the surrounding medium may account for
the conversion of methyl cyanide to methyl isocyanide while the LMH hot core,
which is dominated by thermal processes, does not produce a significant amount
of methyl isocyanide. Ice analog experiments by other investigators have shown
that radiation bombardment of methyl cyanide can produce methyl isocyanide,
thus supporting our observations. We conclude that isomers separated by such
large bonding energy differences are distributed in different interstellar
environments, making the evaluation of column density ratios between such
isomers irrelevant unless it can be independently shown that these species are
co-spatial.",2005-06-21T17:15:25Z
A fresh view on Henize 2-10 with VLT/NAOS-CONICA,"We present high-resolution observations of Henize 2-10 in Ks (2.2um), L'
(3.8um), M' (4.8um) bands. These allow for the first time to track accurately
the structures at the heart of the galaxy from the optical to the radio. All
radio knots previously observed can now be associated with L' and Ks emitting
regions. This implies a revision of their physical nature. Instead of highly
extinguished ultra-dense HII regions, we propose that two of the 5 radio knots
are either supernova remnants or ""normal"" HII regions, while the remaining
three are bona fide ultra-dense HII regions, although less obscured than was
previously thought.",2005-06-02T02:29:39Z
"Gamma-ray bursts as dark energy-matter probes in the context of the
  generalized Chaplygin gas model","In this paper we consider the use of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) as distance
markers to study the unification of dark energy and dark matter in the context
of the so-called Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model. We consider that the
GRB luminosity may be estimated from its variability, time-lag, and also use
the so-called Ghirlanda relation. We evaluate the improvements one may expect
once more GRBs and their redshift become available. We show that although GRBs
allow for extending the Hubble diagram to higher redshifts, its use as a dark
energy probe is limited when compared to SNe Ia. We find that the information
from GRBs can provide some bounds on the amount of dark matter and dark energy
independently of the equation of state. This is particularly evident for
XCDM-type models, which are, for low-redshifts ($z\leq2$), degenerate with the
GCG.",2005-07-08T00:47:31Z
Evolution of X-ray emission from young massive star clusters,"The evolution of X-ray emission from young massive star clusters is modeled,
taking into account the emission from the stars as well as from the cluster
wind. It is shown that the level and character of the soft (0.2-10 keV) X-ray
emission change drastically with cluster age and are tightly linked with
stellar evolution. Using the modern X-ray observations of massive stars we show
that the correlation between bolometric and X-ray luminosity known for single O
stars also holds for O+O and O+Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries. The diffuse emission
originates from the cluster wind heated by the kinetic energy of stellar winds
and supernova explosions. To model the evolution of the cluster wind, the mass
and energy yields from a population synthesis are used as input to a
hydrodynamic model. It is shown that in a very young clusters the emission from
the cluster wind is low. When the cluster evolves, WR stars are formed. Their
strong stellar winds power an increasing X-ray emission of the cluster wind.
Subsequent supernova explosions pump the level of diffuse emission even higher.
Clusters at this evolutionary stage may have no X-ray bright stellar point
sources, but a relatively high level of diffuse emission. A supernova remnant
may become a dominant X-ray source, but only for a short time interval of a few
thousand years. We retrieve and analyse Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of
six massive star clusters located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our model
reproduces the observed diffuse and point-source emission from these LMC
clusters, as well as from the Galactic clusters Arches, Quintuplet and NGC
3603.",2005-05-25T14:20:56Z
The Dwarf Nova PQ Andromedae,"We report a photometric study of the WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova PQ
Andromedae. The light curve shows strong (0.05 mag full amplitude) signals with
periods of 1263(1) and 634(1) s, and a likely double-humped signal with
P=80.6(2) min. We interpret the first two as nonradial pulsation periods of the
underlying white dwarf, and the last as the orbital period of the underlying
binary. We estimate a distance of 150(50) pc from proper motions and the two
standard candles available: the white dwarf and the dwarf-nova outburst. At
this distance, the K magnitude implies that the secondary is probably fainter
than any star on the main sequence -- indicating a mass below the Kumar limit
at 0.075 M_sol. PQ And may be another ""period bouncer"", where evolution now
drives the binary out to longer period.",2005-06-07T08:37:47Z

  Search for TeV-Energy Antiprotons","The shadowing of high-energy cosmic rays by the Moon has been observed with a
significance of 9.4 standard deviations with the L3+C muon spectrometer at
CERN. A significant effect of the Earth magnetic field is observed. Since no
event deficit on the east side of the Moon has been observed, an upper limit at
90% confidence level on the antiproton to proton ratio of 0.11 is obtained for
primary energies around 1 TeV.",2005-03-22T13:38:19Z
"Magnetic deflections and possible sources of the ultra-high-energy
  cosmic rays in the AGASA-HiRes-Yakutsk cluster","The cluster of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed by the AGASA, HiRes and
Yakutsk experiments is studied with respect to possible deflections of
particles in regular magnetic fields. Best-fit positions of a potential source
of these clustered particles are found, with account of the errors in energy
estimation, both in the frameworks of particular models of the Galactic
magnetic field and treating the direction and the amount of deflection as free
parameters. The study suggests that an unknown regular component of either
Galactic or extragalactic magnetic field may dominate over modelled components
in the direction of the cluster. Possible sources of the cosmic rays in that
direction are considered.",2005-05-12T15:59:47Z
From Little Bangs to the Big Bang,"The `Little Bangs' made in particle collider experiments reproduce the
conditions in the Big Bang when the age of the Universe was a fraction of a
second. It is thought that matter was generated, the structures in the Universe
were formed and cold dark matter froze out during this very early epoch when
the equation of state of the Universe was dominated by the quark-gluon plasma
(QGP). Future Little Bangs may reveal the mechanism of matter generation and
the nature of cold dark matter. Knowledge of the QGP will be an essential
ingredient in quantitative understanding of the very early Universe.",2005-04-22T15:01:03Z
"Multi-Dimensional Density Estimation and Phase Space Structure Of Dark
  Matter Halos","We present a method to numerically estimate the densities of a discretely
sampled data based on binary space partitioning tree. We start with a root node
containing all the particles and then recursively divide each node into two
nodes each containing roughly equal number of particles,until each of the nodes
contains only one particle. The volume of such a leaf node provides an estimate
of the local density. We implement an entropy-based node splitting criterion
that results in a significant improvement in the estimation of densities
compared to earlier work. The method is completely metric free and can be
applied to arbitrary number of dimensions. We apply this method to determine
the phase space densities of dark matter halos obtained from cosmological
N-body simulations. We find that contrary to earlier studies, the volume
distribution function $v(f)$ of phase space density $f$ does not have a
constant slope but rather a small hump at high phase space densities. We
demonstrate that a model in which a halo is made up by a superposition of
Hernquist spheres is not capable in explaining the shape of $v(f)$ vs $f$
relation, whereas a model which takes into account the contribution of the main
halo separately roughly reproduces the behavior as seen in simulations. The use
of the presented method is not limited to calculation of phase space densities,
but can be used as a general-purpose data-mining tool and due to its speed and
accuracy it is ideally suited for analysis of large multidimensional data sets.",2005-07-24T19:47:18Z
Revised dynamics or dark matter in galactic and extra galactic scales?,"Allowing the energy of a gravitational field to serve partially as its own
source allows gravitating bodies to exhibit stronger fields, as if they were
more massive. Depending on degree of compaction of the body, the field could be
one to five times larger than the newtonian field. This is a comfortable range
of increase in field strength and may prove to be of convenience in the study
of velocity curves of spirals, of velocity dispersions in clusters of galaxies
and in interpreting the Tully-Fisher or Faber-Jackson relations in galaxies or
systems of galaxies. The revised gravitation admits of superposition principle
but only approximately in systems whose components are widely separated. The
revised dynamics admits of the equivalence principle in that, the effective
force acting on a test particle is derived from a potential, and could be
eliminated in a freely falling frame of reference",2005-05-18T11:12:45Z
"Enhanced X-ray variability from V1647 Ori, the young star in outburst
  illuminating McNeil's Nebula","We report a ~38 ks X-ray observation of McNeil's Nebula obtained with XMM on
2004 April 4. V1647 Ori, the young star in outburst illuminating McNeil's
Nebula, is detected with XMM and appears variable in X-rays. We investigate the
hardness ratio variability and time variations of the event energy distribution
with quantile analysis, and show that the large increase of the count rate from
V1647 Ori observed during the second half of the observation is not associated
with any large plasma temperature variations as for typical X-ray flares from
young low-mass stars. X-ray spectral fitting shows that the bulk (~75%) of the
intrinsic X-ray emission in the 0.5-8 keV energy band comes from a soft plasma
component (0.9 keV) reminiscent of the X-ray spectrum of the classical T Tauri
star TW Hya, for which X-ray emission is believed to be generated by an
accretion shock onto the photosphere of a low-mass star. The hard plasma
component (4.2 keV) contributes ~25% of the total X-ray emission, and can be
understood only in the framework of plasma heating sustained by magnetic
reconnection events. We find a hydrogen column density of NH=4.1E22 cm-2, which
points out a significant excess of hydrogen column density compared to the
value derived from optical/IR observations, consistent with the picture of the
rise of a wind/jet unveiled from ground optical spectroscopy. The X-ray flux
observed with XMM ranges from roughly the flux observed by Chandra on 2004
March 22 (~10 times greater than the pre-outburst X-ray flux) to a value two
times greater than that caught by Chandra on 2004 March 7 (~200 times greater
than the pre-outburst X-ray flux). We have investigated the possibility that
V1647 Ori displays a periodic variation in X-ray brightness as suggested by the
combined Chandra+XMM data set (abridged).",2005-04-05T15:18:42Z
The Progenitor of SN 2005cs in the Whirlpool Galaxy,"The progenitor of SN 2005cs, in the galaxy M51, is identified in
pre-explosion HST ACS WFC imaging. Differential astrometry, with post-explosion
ACS HRC F555W images, permitted the identification of the progenitor with an
accuracy of 0.006"". The progenitor was detected in the F814W pre-explosion
image with I=23.3+/-0.2, but was below the detection thresholds of the F435W
and F555W images, with B<24.8 and V<25 at 5-sigma. Limits were also placed on
the U and R band fluxes of the progenitor from pre-explosion HST WFPC2 F336W
and F675W images. Deep images in the infra-red from NIRI on the Gemini-North
telescope were taken 2 months prior to explosion, but the progenitor is not
clearly detected on these. The upper limits for the JHK magnitudes of the
progenitor were J<21.9,H<21.1 and K<20.7. Despite having a detection in only
one band, a restrictive spectral energy distribution of the progenitor star can
be constructed and a robust case is made that the progenitor was a red
supergiant with spectral type between mid-K to late-M. The spectral energy
distribution allows a region in the theoretical HR diagram to be determined
which must contain the progenitor star. The initial mass of the star is
constrained to be M(ZAMS)=9+3/-2 M_solar, which is very similar to the
identified progenitor of the type II-P SN 2003gd, and also consistent with
upper mass limits placed on five other similar SNe. The upper limit in the deep
K-band image is significant in that it allows us to rule out the possibility
that the progenitor was a significantly higher mass object enshrouded in a dust
cocoon before core-collapse. This is further evidence that the trend for type
II-P SNe to arise in low to moderate mass red supergiants is real.",2005-07-21T10:08:19Z
"uvby-Hbeta CCD photometry and membership segregation of the open cluster
  NGC 2548; Gaps in the Main Sequence of open clusters","Deep CCD photometry in the uvby-Hbeta intermediate-band system is presented
for the cluster NGC 2548 (M 48). A complete membership analysis based on
astrometric and photometric criteria is applied. The photometric analysis of a
selected sample of stars yields a reddening value of E(b-y)=0.06\pm0.03, a
distance modulus of V_0-M_V=9.3\pm0.5 (725 pc) and a metallicity of [Fe/H]=
-0.24\pm0.27. Through isochrone fitting we find an age of log t = 8.6\pm0.1
(400 Myr). Our optical photometry and JHK from 2MASS are combined to derive
effective temperatures of cluster member stars. The effective temperature
distribution along the main sequence of the cluster shows several gaps. A test
to study the significance of these gaps in the main sequence of the HR diagram
has been applied. The method is also applied to several other open clusters
(Pleiades, Hyades, NGC 1817 and M 67) to construct a sequence of metallicities
and ages. The comparison of the results of each cluster gives four gaps with
high significance (one of them, centred at 4900 K, has not been previously
reported).",2005-04-02T17:27:16Z
"Forward modeling of stellar coronae: from a 3D MHD model to synthetic
  EUV spectra","A forward model is described in which we synthesize spectra from an ab-initio
3D MHD simulation of an outer stellar atmosphere, where the coronal heating is
based on braiding of magnetic flux due to photospheric footpoint motions. We
discuss the validity of assumptions such as ionization equilibrium and
investigate the applicability of diagnostics like the differential emission
measure inversion. We find that the general appearance of the synthesized
corona is similar to the solar corona and that, on a statistical basis,
integral quantities such as average Doppler shifts or differential emission
measures are reproduced remarkably well. The persistent redshifts in the
transition region, which have puzzled theorists since their discovery, are
explained by this model as caused by the flows induced by the heating through
braiding of magnetic flux. While the model corona is only slowly evolving in
intensity, as is observed, the amount of structure and variability in Doppler
shift is very large. This emphasizes the need for fast coronal spectroscopy, as
the dynamical response of the corona to the heating process manifests itself in
a comparably slow evolving coronal intensity but rapid changes in Doppler
shift.",2005-03-16T12:59:43Z
The very local Hubble flow: Simulating transition from chaos to order,"The physical nature of the very local (<3 Mpc) Hubble flow is studied on the
basis of the recent high precision observations in the Local Volume. A model
including both analytical treatment and computer simulations describes the flow
dynamical evolution from a chaotic Little Bang initial state to the present-day
state of a quasi-regular expansion. The two major observational parameters of
the flow, which are the rate of expansion and the velocity dispersion, find a
clear qualitative and quantitative explanation in the model.",2005-07-15T06:37:41Z
"The orbit of the close spectroscopic binary epsilon Lupi and the
  intrinsic variability of its early B-type components","We subjected 106 new high-resolution spectra of the double-lined
spectroscopic close binary epsilon Lupi, obtained in a time-span of 17 days
from two different observatories, to a detailed study of orbital and intrinsic
variations. We derived accurate values of the orbital parameters. We refined
the sidereal orbital period to 4.55970 days and the eccentricity to e=0.277. By
adding old radial velocities, we discovered the presence of apsidal motion with
a period of the rotation of apses of about 430 years. Such a value agrees with
theoretical expectations. Additional data is needed to confirm and refine this
value. Our dataset did not allow us to derive the orbit of the third body,
which is known to orbit the close system in approximately 64 years. We present
the secondary of epsilon Lupi as a new beta Cephei variable, while the primary
is a beta Cephei suspect. A first detailed analysis of line-profile variations
of both primary and secondary led to detection of one pulsation frequency near
10.36 c/d in the variability of the secondary, while no clear periodicity was
found in the primary, although low-amplitude periodicities are still suspected.
The limited accuracy and extent of our dataset did not allow any further
analysis, such as mode-identification.",2005-07-15T15:43:24Z
"Spectroscopic study of the long-period dust-producing WC7pd+O9 binary
  HD192641","We present the results of an optical spectroscopic study of the massive
Wolf-Rayet binary WR137. These data cover the dust-formation maximum in 1997.
Combining all available measurements of radial velocities, we derive, for the
first time, a spectroscopic orbit with period 13.05 +/- 0.18 years. The
resulting masses, adopting i=67degrees, are M(O)= 20 +/- 2 Mo and M(WR)= 4.4+/-
1.5 Mo. These appear, respectively, around normal and on the low side for the
given spectral types. Analysis of the intense multi-site spectroscopic
monitoring in 1999 shows that the CIII5696 and CIV5802/12 lines have the
highest intrinsic variability levels. The periodogram analysis yields a
small-amplitude modulation in the absorption troughs of the CIV5802/12 and
HeI5876 lines with a period of 0.83 days, which could be related either to
pulsations or large-scale rotating structures as seen in the WN4 star EZ Canis
Majoris (WR6).Wavelet analysis of the strong emission lines of CIII5696 and
CIV5802/12 enabled us to isolate and follow for several hours small structures
associated with density enhancements within the wind of the Wolf-Rayet star.
Cross-correlating the variability patterns seen in different lines, we find a
weak but significant correlation between the varability in emission lines with
different ionization potential, i.e. in lines formed at different distances
from the WR stellar core. Adopting a beta wind-velocity law, from the motion of
individual subpeaks we find beta around 5, which is significantly larger than
the canonical value of 1 usually found in O-star winds.",2005-04-21T16:33:23Z
"A new constraint on the time dependence of the proton-to-electron mass
  ratio. Analysis of the Q 0347-383 and Q 0405-443 spectra","A new limit on the possible cosmological variation of the proton-to-electron
mass ratio \mu=m_p/m_e is estimated by measuring wavelengths of H_2 lines of
Lyman and Werner bands from two absorption systems at z_abs = 2.5947 and 3.0249
in the spectra of quasars Q 0405-443 and Q 0347-383, respectively. Data are of
the highest spectral resolution (R = 53000) and S/N ratio (30\div70) for this
kind of study. We search for any correlation between z_i, the redshift of
observed lines, determined using laboratory wavelengths as references, and K_i,
the sensitivity coefficient of the lines to a change of \mu, that could be
interpreted as a variation of \mu over the corresponding cosmological time. We
use two sets of laboratory wavelengths, the first one, Set (A) (Abgrall et
al.), based on experimental determination of energy levels and the second one,
Set (P) (Philip et al.), based on new laboratory measurements of some
individual rest-wavelengths. We find \Delta\mu/\mu = (3.05+-0.75)10^-5 for Set
(A), and \Delta\mu/\mu = (1.65+-0.74)10^-5 for Set (P). The second
determination is the most stringent limit on the variation of \mu over the last
12 Gyrs ever obtained. The correlation found using Set (A) seems to show that
some amount of systematic error is hidden in the determination of energy levels
of the H$_2$ molecule.",2005-07-07T15:53:53Z
Ultra High Energy Neutrino Astronomy,"The short review of theoretical aspects of ultra high energy (UHE) neutrinos

"A Catalogue of Field Horizontal Branch Stars Aligned with High Velocity
  Clouds","We present a catalogue of 430 Field Horizontal Branch (FHB) stars, selected
from the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), which fortuitously align with high column
density neutral hydrogen (HI) High-Velocity Cloud (HVC) gas. These stars are
ideal candidates for absorption-line studies of HVCs, attempts at which have
been made for almost 40 years with little success. A parent sample of 8321 HES
FHB stars was used to extract HI spectra along each line-of-sight, using the HI
Parkes All-Sky Survey. All lines-of-sight aligned with high velocity HI
emission with peak brightness temperatures greater than 120mK were examined.
The HI spectra of these 430 probes were visually screened and cross-referenced
with several HVC catalogues. In a forthcoming paper, we report on the results
of high-resolution spectroscopic observations of a sample of stars drawn from
this catalogue.",2005-06-27T09:36:40Z
Varying Electromagnetic Coupling and Primordial Magnetic Fields,"We study the effect of variations of the electromagnetic coupling on the
process of generation of primordial magnetic fields. We find that only through
a significant growth of the electromagnetic coupling minimum seed fields can be
produced. We also show that, if through some process in the early Universe the
photon acquires a mass that leads, thanks to inflation, to the generation of
primordial magnetic fields, then the influence of variations of the
electromagnetic coupling amounts essentially to the results due to the photon
effective mass alone.",2005-04-08T17:01:27Z
"Post-glitch variability in the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1RXS
  J170849.0-400910","We report on the first XMM-Newton observation of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar
1RXS J170849.0-400910. The source was observed in 2003 August and was found at
a flux level a factor of about two lower than previous observations. Moreover,
a significant spectral evolution appears to be present, the source exhibiting a
much softer spectrum than in the past. Comparison of the present properties of
1RXS J170849.0-400910 with those from archival data shows a clear correlation
between the X-ray flux and the spectral hardness. In particular, the flux and
the spectral hardness reached a maximum level close to the two glitches the
source experienced in 1999 and in 2001, and successively decreased. Although
the excellent XMM-Newton spectral resolution should in principle allow us to
detect the absorption line reported in a phase-resolved spectrum with BeppoSAX
and interpreted as a cyclotron feature, we found no absorption features,
neither in the phase averaged spectrum nor in the phase resolved spectra. We
discuss in detail both the possibilities that the feature in the BeppoSAX data
may have resulted from a spurious detection or that it is real and
intrinsically variable. We then discuss a possible explanation for the glitches
and for the softening of the source emission which followed the flux decrease,
in the framework of the magnetar model.",2005-05-19T12:06:37Z
Wiggly cosmic strings accrete dark energy,"This paper deals with a study of the cylindrically symmetric accretion of
dark energy with equation of state $p=w\rho$ onto wiggly straight cosmic
strings. We have obtained that when $w>-1$ the linear energy density in the
string core gradually increases tending to a finite maximum value as time
increases for all considered dark energy models. On the regime where the
dominant energy condition is violated all such models predict a steady
decreasing of the linear energy density of the cosmic strings as phantom energy
is being accreted. The final state of the string after such an accretion
process is a wiggleless defect. It is argued however that if accreation of
phantom energy would proceed by successive quantum steps then the defect would
continue losing linear energy density until a minimum nonzero value which can
be quite smaller than that corresponding to the unperturbed string.",2005-06-29T09:26:33Z
Detailed Chemical Abundances of Extragalactic Globular Clusters,"We outline a method to measure the detailed chemical composition of
extragalactic (unresolved) globular clusters (GCs) from echelle spectra of
their integrated light. Our goal is to use this method to measure abundance
patterns of GCs in distant spiral and elliptical galaxies to constrain their
formation histories. To develop this technique we have obtained a ``training
set'' of integrated-light spectra of resolved GCs in the Milky Way and LMC by
scanning across the clusters during exposures. Our training set also include
spectra of individual stars in those GCs from which abundances can be obtained
in the normal way to provide a check on our integrated-light results. We
present here the preliminary integrated-light analysis of one GC in our
training set, NGC 104 (47 Tuc), and outline some of the techniques utilized and
problems encountered in that analysis.",2005-07-01T21:07:15Z
On The Origin Of Unidentified EGRET Gamma-Ray Sources,"The identification of celestial gamma-ray sources with astronomical objects
or object classes has remained the initial and most fundamental key for
understanding their physical nature. The observational characteristic of a
gamma-ray emitter and the conditions under which an astronomical object is able
to produce energetic gamma-ray emission defines the range of candidates
available for source identifications. The main obstacle must be seen in the
fact that a gamma-ray source location is often imprecise, a flux history could
only be established on the basis of weeks, and uncertainties in the gamma-ray
observables are considerably large. Therefore coordinated multifrequency
follow-up campaigns or spatial-statistical methods are required to assign
proper counterpart identifications. Although Active Galactic Nuclei and pulsars
are uniquely identified EGRET sources, many other gamma-ray sources still
remain unidentified. I will review properties of the population and highlight
the characteristics of potential counterparts of the still unidentified

  Supernovae","The Supernova Acceleration Probe (SNAP) will use Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
as distance indicators to measure the effect of dark energy on the expansion
history of the Universe. (SNAP's weak-lensing program is described in a
companion White Paper.) The experiment exploits supernova distance measurements
up to their fundamental systematic limit; strict requirements on the monitoring
of each supernova's properties lead to the need for a space-based mission.
Results from pre-SNAP experiments, which characterize fundamental SN Ia
properties, will be used to optimize the SNAP observing strategy to yield data,
which minimize both systematic and statistical uncertainties. SNAP has achieved
technological readiness and the collaboration is poised to begin construction.",2005-07-19T21:13:53Z
OI Line Emission in the Quasar PG 1116+215,"By observing the near-infrared spectrum of the quasar PG 1116+215 at z =
0.176 and combining with the HST/FOS spectrum, we obtained the relative
strengths of three permitted OI lines ({lambda}1304, {lambda}8446, and
{lambda}11287) in a quasar for the first time. The photon flux ratios of the OI
lines of the quasar were compared with those previously measured in a Seyfert 1
and six narrow-line Seyfert 1s. No significant differences were found in the OI
line flux ratios between the quasar and the other Seyferts, suggesting that the
gas density in the OI and FeII line-emitting regions in the quasar is of the
same order as those in low-luminosity AGNs. It was also found that the line
width of OI {lambda}11287 is significantly narrower than that of Ly{alpha},
which is consistent with OI and FeII emission occurring in the partly ionized
regions at the outermost portion of the broad-line region where velocities are
small.",2005-05-29T05:04:49Z
Star formation rates and mass distributions in interacting galaxies,"We present a systematic investigation of the star formation rate (hereafter
SFR) in interacting disk galaxies. We determine the dependence of the overall
SFR on different spatial alignments and impact parameters of more than 50
different configurations in combined N-body/hydrodynamic simulations. We also
show mass profiles of the baryonic components. We find that galaxy-galaxy
interactions can enrich the surrounding intergalatic medium with metals very
efficiently up to distances of several 100 kpc. This enrichment can be
explained in terms of indirect processes like thermal driven galactic winds or
direct processes like 'kinetic' spreading of baryonic matter. In the case of
equal mass mergers the direct -kinetic- redistribution of gaseous matter (after
5 Gyr) is less efficient than the environmental enrichment of the same isolated
galaxies by a galactic wind. In the case of non-equal mass mergers however, the
direct -kinetic- process dominates the redistribution of gaseous matter.
Compared to the isolated systems, the integrated star formation rates (ISFRs)
($\int_{t = 0 Gyr}^{t = 5 Gyr}\textnormal{SFR(t)}dt$) in the modelled
interacting galaxies are in extreme cases a factor of 5 higher and on average a
factor of 2 higher in interacting galaxies. Co-rotating and counter-rotating
interactions do not show a common trend for the enhancement of the ISFRs
depending on the interaction being edge-on or face-on. The latter case shows an
increase of the ISFRs for the counter-rotating system of about 100%, whereas
the edge-on counter-rotating case results in a lower increase ($\sim$ 10%).",2005-03-25T09:57:30Z
Soft gamma-ray background and light Dark Matter annihilation,"The bulk of the extragalactic background between 10 keV and 10 GeV is likely
to be explained by the emission of Seyfert galaxies, type Ia supernovae, and
blazars. However, as revealed by the INTEGRAL satellite, the bulge of our
galaxy is an intense source of a 511 keV gamma-ray line, indicating the
production of a large number of positrons that annihilate. The origin of the
latter is debated, and they could be produced, in particular, by the (S- or
P-wave) annihilation of light Dark Matter particles into e+e-. In any case, the
cumulated effect of similar sources at all redshifts could lead to a new
background of hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray photons. On the basis of the
hierarchical model of galaxy formation, we compute analytically the SNIa
contribution to the background, and add it to Seyfert and blazars emission
models. We find that any extra contribution to this unresolved background at
511 keV should be lower than about 4 keV/cm^2/s/sr. We also estimate
analytically the extragalactic background due to Dark Matter annihilation,
increasing the accuracy of the earlier computations. Indeed, we take into
account the large positron escape fraction from low mass dark matter halos,
unable to confine a dense and magnetized interstellar medium. Our new
background estimate turns out to be one order of magnitude lower, so that the
hypothesis of a light Dark Matter candidate remains compatible with the
observed extragalactic background for a wider range of particle masses and
cross-sections.",2005-07-29T15:51:07Z
Confinement-Driven Spatial Variations in the Cosmic Ray Flux,"Low-energy cosmic rays (CRs) are confined by self-generated MHD waves in the
mostly neutral ISM. We show that the CR transport equation can be expressed as
a continuity equation for the CR number density involving an effective
convection velocity. Assuming balance between wave growth and ion-neutral
damping, this equation gives a steady-state condition n_cr ~ n_i^1/2 up to a
critical density for free streaming. This relation naturally accounts for the
heretofore unexplained difference in CR ionization rates derived for dense
diffuse clouds (McCall et al. 2003) and dark clouds, and predicts large spatial
variations in the CR heating rate and pressure.",2005-03-28T07:22:17Z
New High-Redshift Galaxies at $z$ = 5.8 - 6.5 in the Subaru Deep Field,"In order to search for high-redshift galaxies around $z \sim 6$ in the Subaru
Deep Field, we have investigated NB816-dropout galaxies where NB816 is the
narrowband filter centered at 815nm with FWHM of 12.5 nm for the Suprime-Cam on
the Subaru Telescope. Since the NB816 imaging is so deep we can detect 10
well-defined NB816-dropout galaxies that we identify to lie at $z$ = 5.8 --
6.5. We discuss their observational properties.",2005-05-30T07:00:20Z

Dark energy and the evolution of spherical overdensities,"We use the non-linear spherical model in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies
with dark energy to investigate the effects of dark energy on the growth of
structure and the formation of virialised structures. We consider dark energy
models with a constant equation of state parameter w. For -1<w<-1/3, clusters
form earlier and are more concentrated in quintessence than in LambdaCDM
models, but they form later and are less concentrated than in the corresponding
open model with the same matter density and no dark energy. We point out some
confusion in the literature around the expression of the collapse factor (ratio
of the radius of the sphere at virialisation to that at turn-around) derived
from the virial theorem. We use the Sheth & Tormen extension of the
Press-Schechter framework to calculate the evolution of the cluster abundance
in different models and show the sensitivity of the cluster abundance to both
the amplitude of the mass fluctuations, sigma8, and the sigma8-w normalisation,
selected to match either the cosmic microwave background observations or the
abundance of X-ray clusters.",2005-04-21T12:05:37Z
"Spatially Resolved STIS Spectra of Betelgeuse's Upper Chromosphere and
  Circumstellar Dust Envelope","The Hubble Space Telescope observed red supergiant Betelgeuse with the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to investigate the outer atmosphere from
spatially resolved spectra. We present a new set of seven high-resolution
near-UV spectra observed with HST-STIS in fall 2002 and spring 2003, by
scanning at chromospheric intensity peak-up position and six off-limb target
positions up to three arcseconds away from the star. A small aperture is used
to study and determine the thermal conditions and flow dynamics in its upper
chromosphere and inner circumstellar dust envelope. We provide the first
evidence for the presence of warm chromospheric plasma at least 3 arcseconds
away from Betelgeuse at ~120 R* (1 R* ~= 700 Rsun) based on detailed
spectroscopic observations of the Mg II h & k emission lines. Many other weak
chromospheric emission lines as Fe II lam2716, C II lam2327, Al II] lam2669,
and Fe I lam2823 are detected out to at least 1 arcsecond in the spatially
resolved STIS observations. The profiles of the Mg II h & k and the Si I
resonance emission lines reveal a strong increase of asymmetry by scanning
off-limb, signaling the outward acceleration of wind expansion in Betelgeuse's
upper chromosphere beyond 200 mas (~8 R*). We discuss detailed radiative
transfer models that fit the STIS observations showing that the local kinetic
gas temperature in the upper chromosphere exceeds 2600 K. Our radiation
transport models for the IR silicate dust emission at 9.8 um in the upper
chromosphere show however that the ambient gas temperature remains below 600 K
to sustain the presence of dust grains. Hence, the STIS spectra of Betelgeuse's
upper chromosphere directly demonstrate that warm chromospheric plasma must
co-exist with cool dusty plasma in its outer atmosphere.",2005-04-23T23:46:11Z
"On the Afterglow and Host Galaxy of GRB021004: A Comprehensive Study
  with the Hubble Space Telescope","(Abridged) We report on HST observations of the late-time afterglow and host
galaxy of GRB021004 (z=2.33). Although this GRB is one of the best observed so
far, there is substantial disagreement between different interpretations of
data sets on this burst in the literature. We have observed the field of
GRB021004 with the HST at multiple epochs from 3 days until almost 10 months
after the burst. With STIS spectroscopy we cover the spectral region 600-1700AA
in the restframe. From the limit on the flux recovery bluewards of the
Lyman-limit we constrain the HI column density to be above 1x10^18 cm-2 Based
on ACS and NICMOS imaging we find that the afterglow evolved achromatically
within the errors. The color changes observed by other authors during the first
four days must be related to a stochastic phenomenon superimposed on an
afterglow component with a constant spectral shape. This achromaticity implies
that the cooling break has remained on the blue side of the optical part of the
spectrum for at least two weeks after the burst. The optical-to-X-ray slope is
consistent with being the same at 1.4 and 52.4 days after the burst. This
indicates that the cooling frequency is constant and hence, according to
fireball models, that the circumburst medium has a constant density profile.
The late-time slope of the lightcurve is in the range alpha_2 = 1.8-1.9, and is
inconsistent with a single power-law. This could be due to a late-time
flattening caused by the transition to non-relativistic expansion or due to
excess emission (a lightcurve `bump') 7 days after burst. The host is a
starburst galaxy with no evidence for dust and with strong Ly-alpha emission.
The afterglow was located very close (~100 pc) to the center of the host
suggesting that the progenitor was associated with a circumnuclear starburst.",2005-06-05T15:36:40Z
The build-up of the Coma cluster by infalling substructures,"We present a new multiwavelength analysis of the Coma cluster subclustering
based on recent X-ray data and on a compilation of nearly 900 redshifts. We
characterize subclustering using the Serna&Gerbal (1996) hierarchical method
which makes use of galaxy positions, redshifts, and magnitudes, and identify 17
groups. One of these groups corresponds to the main cluster, one is the well
known group associated with the infalling galaxy NGC4839 and one is associated
with NGC4911/NGC4926. About one third of the 17 groups have velocity
distributions centered on the velocities of the very bright cluster galaxies
they contain (magnitudes R<13). In order to search for additional
substructures, we make use of the isophotes of X-ray brightness residuals left
after the subtraction of the best-fit beta-model from the overall X-ray gas
distribution (Neumann et al. 2003). We select galaxies within each of these
isophotes and compare their velocity distributions with that of the whole
cluster. We confirm in this way the two groups associated, respectively, with
NGC4839, and with the southern part of the extended western substructure
visible in X-rays. We discuss the group properties in the context of a scenario
in which Coma is built by the accretion of groups infalling from the
surrounding large scale structure. We estimate the recent mass accretion rate
of Coma and compare it with hierarchical models of cluster evolution.",2005-07-22T15:56:00Z
Magnetic-field generation in helical turbulence,"We investigate analytically the amplification of a weak magnetic field in a
homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow lacking reflectional symmetry (helical
turbulence). We propose that the spectral distributions of magnetic energy and
magnetic helicity can be found as eigenmodes of a self-adjoint,
Schr\""odinger-type system of evolution equations. We argue that large-scale and
small-scale magnetic fluctuations cannot be effectively separated, and that the
conventional alpha-model is, in general, not an adequate description of the
large-scale dynamo mechanism. As a consequence, the correct numerical modeling
of such processes should resolve magnetic fluctuations down to the very small,
resistive scales.",2005-04-27T02:37:44Z
Redshift indicators for gamma-ray bursts,"The measure of the distances and luminosities of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) led
to the discovery that many GRB properties are strongly correlated with their
intrinsic luminosity, leading to the construction of reliable luminosity
indicators. These GRB luminosity indicators have quickly found applications,
like the construction of 'pseudo-redshifts', or the measure of luminosity
distances, which can be computed independently of the measure of the redshift.
In this contribution I discuss various issues connected with the construction
of luminosity-redshift indicators for gamma-ray bursts.",2005-05-04T15:18:11Z
"Fully Threaded Transport Engine: New Method for Multi-Scale Radiative
  Transfer","A new, very fast method for 3D radiative transfer on fully threaded grids
with arbitrarily high angular resolution is presented. The method uses
completely cell-based discretization, and is ideally suited for problems with
diffuse background radiation, often encountered in cosmological and star
formation models. We find that for accurate statistical study of intergalactic
Ly-alpha absorption lines one needs of order of few hundred angular
discretization elements even for models without radiative feedback from star
forming galaxies.",2005-05-09T19:27:02Z
"AMICA, an astro-mapper for AMS","The Alpha Magnetic Spectrograph (AMS) is a composite particle detector to be
accommodated on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2008. AMS is mainly
devoted to galactic, charged Cosmic Rays studies, Antimatter and Dark Matter
searches. Besides the main, classical physics goals, capabilities in the field
of GeV and multi-GeV gamma astrophysics have been established and are under
investigation by a number of groups. Due to the unsteadiness of the ISS
platform, a star-mapper device is required in order to fully exploit the
intrinsic arc-min angular resolution provided by the Silicon Tracker. A
star-mapper is conceptually an imaging, optical instrument able to autonomously
recognize a stellar field and to calculate its own orientation with respect to
an inertial reference frame. AMICA (Astro Mapper for Instruments Check of
Attitude) on AMS is responsible for providing real-time information that is
going to be used off-line for compensating the large uncertainties in the ISS
flight attitude and the structural degrees of freedom. In this paper, we
describe in detail the AMICA sub-system and the accommodation/integration
issues and the in-flight alignment procedure adopting identified galactic
(pulsars) and extragalactic (AGNs) sources.",2005-06-16T11:26:20Z
"NOAO Fundamental Plane Survey -- II. Age and Metallicity along the Red
  Sequence","We present spectroscopic linestrength data for 4097 red-sequence galaxies in
93 low-redshift galaxy clusters, and use these to investigate variations in
average stellar populations as a function of galaxy mass. Our analysis includes
an improved treatment of nebular emission contamination, which affects ~10% of
the sample galaxies. Using the stellar population models of D. Thomas and
collaborators, we simultaneously fit twelve observed linestrength-sigma
relations in terms of common underlying trends of age, [Z/H] (total
metallicity) and a/Fe (alpha-element enhancement). We find that the observed
linestrength-sigma relations can be explained only if higher-mass red-sequence
galaxies are, on average, older, more metal rich, and more alpha-enhanced than
lower-mass galaxies. Quantitatively, the scaling relations are
age=sigma^(0.59+/-0.13), Z/H=sigma^(0.53+/-0.08) and a/Fe=sigma^(0.31+/-0.06),
where the errors reflect the range obtained using different subsets of indices.
We conclude that although the stars in giant red galaxies in clusters formed
early, most of the galaxies at the faint end joined the red sequence only at
recent epochs. This ""down-sizing"" trend is in good qualitative agreement with
observations of the red sequence at higher redshifts, but is not predicted by
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.",2005-05-13T20:26:53Z
"The projection factor of delta Cephei A calibration of the
  Baade-Wesselink method using the CHARA Array","Cepheids play a key role in astronomy as standard candles for measuring
intergalactic distances. Their distance is usually inferred from the
Period-Luminosity relationship, calibrated using the semi-empirical
Baade-Wesselink method. Using this method, the distance is known to a
multiplicative factor, called the projection factor. Presently, this factor is
computed using numerical models - it has hitherto never been measured directly.
Based on our new interferometric measurements obtained with the CHARA Array and
the already published parallax, we present a geometrical measurement of the
projection factor of a Cepheid, delta Cep. The value we determined, p =
1.27$\pm$0.06, confirms the generally adopted value of p = 1.36 within 1.5
sigmas. Our value is in line with recent theoretical predictions of Nardetto et
al. (2004).",2005-06-28T14:09:00Z
"Two-dimensional hydrodynamic core-collapse supernova simulations with
  spectral neutrino transport. I. Numerical method and results for a 15 M_sun
  star","Supernova models with a full spectral treatment of the neutrino transport are
presented, employing the Prometheus/Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code with a
``ray-by-ray plus'' approximation for treating two- (or three-) dimensional
problems. The method is described in detail and critically assessed with
respect to its capabilities, limitations, and inaccuracies in the context of
supernova simulations. In this first paper of a series, 1D and 2D core-collapse
calculations for a (nonrotating) 15 M_sun star are discussed, uncertainties in
the treatment of the equation of state -- numerical and physical -- are tested,
Newtonian results are compared with simulations using a general relativistic
potential, bremsstrahlung and interactions of neutrinos of different flavors
are investigated, and the standard approximation in neutrino-nucleon
interactions with zero energy transfer is replaced by rates that include
corrections due to nucleon recoil, thermal motions, weak magnetism, and nucleon
correlations. Models with the full implementation of the ``ray-by-ray plus''
spectral transport were found not to explode, neither in spherical symmetry nor
in 2D with a 90 degree lateral wedge. The success of previous 2D simulations
with grey, flux-limited neutrino diffusion can therefore not be confirmed.
Omitting the radial velocity terms in the neutrino momentum equation leads to
``artificial'' explosions by increasing the neutrino energy density in the
convective gain layer by about 20--30% and thus the integral neutrino energy
deposition in this region by about a factor of two. (abbreviated)",2005-07-06T15:58:38Z
"Constraining the extra heating of the Diffuse Ionized Gas in the Milky
  Way","The detailed observations of the diffuse ionized gas through the emission
lines H$\alpha$, [NII], and [SII] in the Perseus Arm of our Galaxy by the
Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper (WHAM)--survey challenge photoionization models.
They have to explain the observed rise in the line ratios [NII]/H$\alpha$ and
[SII]/H$\alpha$. The models described here consider for the first time the
detailed observational geometry toward the Perseus Arm. The models address the
vertical variation of the line ratios up to height of 2 kpc above the midplane.
The rising trends of the line ratios are matched. The increase in the line
ratios is reflected in a rise of the temperature of the gas layer. This is due
to the progressive hardening of the radiation going through the gas. However an
extra heating above photoionization is needed to explain the absolute values.
Two different extra heating rates are investigated which are proportional to
$n^0$ and $n^1$. The models show that a combination of both are best to explain
the data, where the extra heating independent of density is dominant for z $>$
0.8 kpc.",2005-06-24T15:40:19Z
X-ray Pulsations in the Supersoft X-ray Binary CAL 83,"X-ray data reveal that the supersoft X-ray binary CAL 83 exhibits 38.4 minute

Planned Dark Matter searches with the MAGIC Telescope,"The MAGIC 17m-diameter Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) has been
commissioned beginning of 2005. The telescope has been designed to achieve the
lower detection energy threshold ever obtained with an IACT, about 50 GeV. A
new window in gamma-ray astronomy is being opened with great impact for
exciting new physics and new discoveries. Among the targets of MAGIC is the
indirect detection of Dark Matter (DM). We have considered different DM halo
models of high DM density objects like the center of the Milky Way, its closest
satellites and nearby galaxies (M31,M87). For each object, detection limits are
computed for different DM halo models in a mSUGRA scenario for supersymmetric
neutralino annihilation $\gamma$-ray production. Advantages and drawbacks of
these objects and plans for future observations are discussed.",2005-05-15T18:28:22Z
"Outflows in Infrared-Luminous Starbursts at z < 0.5. I. Sample, NaI D

galaxies at redshifts up to z = 0.5. We use moderate-resolution spectroscopy of
the NaI D interstellar absorption feature to directly probe the neutral phase
of outflowing gas in these galaxies. Over half of our sample are ultraluminous
infrared galaxies that are classified as starbursts; the rest have infrared
luminosities in the range log(L_IR/L_sun) = 10.2 - 12.0. The sample selection,
observations, and data reduction are described here. The absorption-line

strong maser lines in regions of high-mass star formation. Analysis shows that
most likely the narrow features are masers.",2005-05-11T10:37:14Z
Galaxy Cluster Masses Without Non-Baryonic Dark Matter,"We apply the modified acceleration law obtained from Einstein gravity coupled
to a massive skew symmetric field, F_{\mu\nu\lambda}, to the problem of
explaining X-ray galaxy cluster masses without exotic dark matter. Utilizing
X-ray observations to fit the gas mass profile and temperature profile of the
hot intracluster medium (ICM) with King beta-models, we show that the dynamical
masses of the galaxy clusters resulting from our modified acceleration law fit
the cluster gas masses for our sample of 106 clusters without the need of
introducing a non-baryonic dark matter component. We are further able to show
for our sample of 106 clusters that the distribution of gas in the ICM as a
function of radial distance is well fit by the dynamical mass distribution
arising from our modified acceleration law without any additional dark matter
component. In previous work, we applied this theory to galaxy rotation curves
and demonstrated good fits to our sample of 101 LSB, HSB and dwarf galaxies
including 58 galaxies that were fit photometrically with the single parameter
(M/L)_{stars}. The results there were qualitatively similar to those obtained
using Milgrom's phenomenological MOND model, although the determined galaxy
masses were quantitatively different and MOND does not show a return to
Keplerian behavior at extragalactic distances. The results here are compared to
those obtained using Milgrom's phenomenological MOND model which does not fit
the X-ray galaxy cluster masses unless an auxiliary dark matter component is
included.",2005-07-08T22:00:13Z
Primordial non-gaussianities in single field inflation,"We calculate the three-point function for primordial scalar fluctuations in a
single field inflationary scenario where the scalar field Lagrangian is a
completely general function of the field and its first derivative. We obtain an
explicit expression for the three-point correlation function in a
self-consistent approximation scheme where the expansion rate varies slowly,
analogous to the slow-roll limit in standard, single-field inflation. The
three-point function can be written in terms of the familiar slow-roll
parameters and three new parameters which measure the non-trivial kinetic
structure of the scalar field, the departure of the sound speed from the speed
of light, and the rate of change of the sound speed.",2005-03-31T12:17:43Z
"The History of the Baryon Budget: Cosmic Logistics in a Hierarchical
  Universe","Using a series of high-resolution N-body hydrodynamical numerical
simulations, we investigate several scenarios for the evolution of the baryon
budget in galactic halos. We derive individual halo star formation history
(SFH), as well as the global star formation rate in the universe. We develop a
simple analytical model that allows us to compute surprisingly accurate
predictions, when compared to our simulations, but also to other simulations
presented in Springel & Hernquist (2003). The model depends on two main
parameters: the star formation time scale t* and the wind efficiency eta_w. We
also compute, for halos of a given mass, the baryon fraction in each of the
following phases: cold disc gas, hot halo gas and stars. Here again, our
analytical model predictions are in good agreement with simulation results, if
one correctly takes into account finite resolution effect.
  We compare predictions of our analytical model to several observational
constraints, and conclude that a very narrow range of the model parameters is
allowed. The important role played by galactic winds is outlined, as well as a
possible `superwind' scenario in groups and clusters. The `anti-hierarchical'
behavior of observed SFH is well reproduced by our best model with t*=3Gyr and
eta_w=1.5. We obtain in this case a present-day cosmic baryon budget of Omega*=
0.004, Omega_cold=0.0004, Omega_hot=0.01 and Omega_back=0.02 (diffuse
background).",2005-05-23T14:57:56Z
Simulating field-aligned diffusion of a cosmic ray gas,"The macroscopic behaviour of cosmic rays in turbulent magnetic fields is
discussed. An implementation of anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays with
respect to the magnetic field in a non-conservative, high-order,
finite-difference magnetohydrodynamic code is discussed. It is shown that the
standard implementation fails near singular X-points of the magnetic field,
which are common if the field is random. A modification to the diffusion model
for cosmic rays is described and the resulting telegraph equation (implemented
by solving a dynamic equation for the diffusive flux of cosmic rays) is used;
it is argued that this modification may better describe the physics of cosmic
ray diffusion. The present model reproduces several processes important for the
propagation and local confinement of cosmic rays, including spreading
perpendicular to the local large-scale magnetic field, controlled by the
random-to-total magnetic field ratio, and the balance between cosmic ray
pressure and magnetic tension. Cosmic ray diffusion is discussed in the context
of a random magnetic field produced by turbulent dynamo action. It is argued
that energy equipartition between cosmic rays and other constituents of the
interstellar medium do not necessarily imply that cosmic rays play a
significant role in the balance of forces.",2005-07-07T16:22:45Z
Some statistics of Galactic SNRs,"The selection effects applicable to the identification of Galactic supernova
remnants (SNRs) at radio wavelengths are discussed. Low surface brightness
remnants are missing, as are those with small angular sizes (including young
but distant SNRs). Several statistical properties of Galactic SNRs are
discussed, including the surface-brightness/diameter (Sigma-D) relation. The
wide range of intrinsic properties of Galactic remnants with known distances,
and the observational selection effects, means that the Sigma-D relation is of
limited use to derive diameters and hence distances for individual SNRs, or for
statistical studies.",2005-05-20T08:24:03Z
Contribution of HD molecules in cooling of the primordial gas,"We study the effects of HD molecules on thermochemical evolution of the
primordial gas behind shock waves, possibly arised in the process of galaxy
formation. We find the critical shock velocity when deuterium transforms
efficiently into HD molecules which then dominate gas cooling. Above this
velocity the shocked gas is able to cool down to the temperature of the cosmic
microwave background. Under these conditions the corresponding Jeans mass
depends only on redshift and initial density of baryons $M_J \propto
\delta_c^{-0.5} (1+z)^{0.5}$. At $z\simgt 45$ HD molecules heat shocked gas,
and at larger redshift their contribution to thermal evolution becomes
negligible.",2005-07-26T13:53:33Z
Are radio pulsars progenitors of AXPs and SGRs?,"Possibility of realization of scenario for the AXPs and SGRs origins from
radio pulsars, which were undergone frequent and strong glitches, was analyzed.

of AXPs and SGRs - their association with supernova remnants (SNRs) and
evolution on the $P - \dot P$ diagram, taking into account their real ages,
conflict with offered scenario.",2005-07-21T10:53:09Z
Is the emerging massive cluster NGC 2244 a twin cluster?,"We present in this paper the first near infrared study of the young open
cluster NGC 2244, which is well known for its partially embedded nature in the
Rosette Nebula. Based on the spatially complete 2 Micron All Sky Survey, the
young OB cluster indicates apparent substructures. It is surprisingly resolved
into a compact core that matches well the congregation of massive OB stars in
the optical, a satellite cluster at a distance of 6.6 pc in its west and
probably a major stellar aggregate resembling an arc in structure right below
the core. This infrared study provides various new updates on its nature of the
young open cluster, including its central position, physical scale and stellar
population. A disk fraction of $\sim 20.5\pm2.8%$ is achieved for its members
with masses above 0.8 $M_{\odot}$. NGC 2244 is hence a unique example for the
study of embedded clusters.",2005-04-01T03:46:11Z
Early star formation in the Galaxy from beryllium and oxygen abundances,"We investigate the evolution of the star formation rate in the early Galaxy
using beryllium and oxygen abundances in metal poor stars. Specifically, we
show that stars belonging to two previously identified kinematical classes (the
so-called ``accretion'' and ``dissipative'' populations) are neatly separated
in the [O/Fe] vs. Log(Be/H) diagram. The dissipative population follows the
predictions of our model of Galactic evolution for the thick disk component,
suggesting that the formation of this stellar population occurred on a
timescale significantly longer (by a factor ~5-10) than the accretion
component. The latter shows a large scatter in the [O/Fe] vs. Log(Be/H)
diagram, probably resulting from the inhomogeneous enrichment in oxygen and
iron of the protogalactic gas. Despite the limitation of the sample, the data
suggest that the combined use of products of spallation reactions (like
beryllium) and elemental ratios of stellar nucleosynthesis products (like
[O/Fe]) can constrain theoretical models for the formation and early evolution
of our Galaxy.",2005-05-19T07:41:32Z
"The H II Region/PDR Connection: Self-Consistent Calculations of Physical
  Conditions in Star-Forming Regions","We have performed a series of calculations designed to reproduce infrared
diagnostics used to determine physical conditions in star forming regions. We
self-consistently calculate the thermal and chemical structure of an H II
region and photodissociation region (PDR) that are in pressure equilibrium.
This differs from previous work, which used separate calculations for each gas
phase. Our calculations span a wide range of stellar temperatures, gas
densities, and ionization parameters. We describe improvements made to the
spectral synthesis code Cloudy that made these calculations possible. These
include the addition of a molecular network with ~1000 reactions involving 68
molecular species and improved treatment of the grain physics. Data from the
Spitzer First Look Survey, along with other archives, are used to derive
important physical characteristics of the H II region and PDR. These include
stellar temperatures, electron densities, ionization parameters, UV radiation
flux, and PDR density. Finally, we calculate the contribution of the H II
region to PDR emission line diagnostics, which allows for a more accurate
determination of physical conditions in the PDR.",2005-06-21T21:52:53Z
"Observations of Chemically Enriched QSO Absorbers near z ~ 2.3 Galaxies:
  Galaxy-Formation Feedback Signatures in the IGM","We present a study of galaxies and intergalactic gas toward the z=2.73 quasar
HS1700+6416, to explore the effects of galaxy formation feedback on the IGM.
Our observations and ionization simulations indicate that the volume within
100-200 h_71^{-1} physical kpc of high-redshift galaxies contains very small,
dense, and metal-rich absorption-line regions. These systems often contain
shock-heated gas seen in OVI, and may exhibit [Si/C] abundance enhancements
suggestive of Type II supernova enrichment. We argue that the absorbers
resemble thin sheets or bubbles, whose physical properties can be explained
with a simple model of radiatively efficient shocks propegating through the
IGM. Their high metallicities suggest that these shocks are being expelled
from--rather than falling into--star forming galaxies. There is a dropoff in
the IGM gas density at galaxy impact parameters beyond ~300 physical kpc that
may trace boundaries of gas structures where the galaxies reside. The local
heavy-element enhancement covers 100-200 kpc; beyond this the observed
abundances blend into the general IGM. Supernova-driven winds or dynamical
stripping of interstellar gas appears to affect the IGM near massive galaxies,
even at R>~100 kpc. However, these feedback systems represent only a few
percent of the Lya forest mass at z~2.5. Their mass could be larger if the more
numerous metal-poor CIV systems at >~200 kpc are tepid remnants of very
powerful winds. Based on present observations it is not clear that this
scenario is to be favored over one involving pre-enrichment by smaller galaxies
at z>~6.",2005-08-03T20:15:32Z
"Correcting the influence of an asymmetric line spread function in
  2-degree Field spectrograph data","We investigate the role of asymmetries in the line spread function of the
2-degree field spectrograph and the variations in these asymmetries with the
CCD, the plate, the time of observation and the fibre. A data-reduction
pipeline is developed that takes these deformations into account for the
calibration and cross-correlation of the spectra. We show that, using the
emission lines of calibration lamp observations, we can fit the line spread
function with the sum of two Gaussian functions representing the theoretical
signal and a perturbation of the system. This model is then used to calibrate
the spectra and generate templates by downgrading high resolution spectra.
Thus, we can cross-correlate the observed spectra with templates degraded in
the same way. Our reduction pipeline is tested on real observations and
provides a significant improvement in the accuracy of the radial velocities
obtained. In particular, the systematic errors that were as high as ~20 km/s
when applying the AAO reduction package 2dfDR are now reduced to ~5 km/s. Even
though the 2-degree Field spectrograph is to be decommissioned at the end of
2005, the analysis of archival data and previous studies could be improved by
the reduction procedure we propose here.",2005-03-31T15:32:40Z
dEs and the dI Fundamental Plane,"Despite much work, the connection between dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) and
dwarf irregulars (dIs) remains unclear. Recently, we found that the surface
brightness profiles (SBPs) of dIs in the near-infrared can be well fitted with
a hyperbolic secant (sech) function. From sech fits, a tight relationship was
derived between the absolute magnitude, central surface brightness, and 21cm
line widths, which amounts to a fundamental plane for dIs. Here we examine how
closely dEs fit into the dI fundamental plane using published data for 22 dEs
in the Virgo cluster and the Local Group. Over a 9 mag interval in absolute
magnitude the dEs fall in the plane defined by the dIs. The outstanding overlap
suggests more than a casual relationship between the two classes.",2005-04-18T13:11:19Z
"The optical counterpart of XTE J0929-314, the third transient
  millisecond X-ray pulsar","A blue and variable optical counterpart of the X-ray transient XTE J0929-314
was identified on 2002 May 1. We conducted frequent BVRI broadband photometry
on this object using the Mt Canopus 1-m telescope during May and June until it
had faded to below 21'st magnitude. Nearly continuous I band CCD photometry on
2002 May 2, 3 and 4 revealed a ~ 10 % sinusoidal modulation at the binary
period lasting ~ 6 cycles during the latter half of May 2. The phase indicates
that the modulation may be due to a combination of emission by a hot spot on
the disc and X-ray heating of the secondary. The emission generally trended
bluer with B-I decreasing by 0.6 magnitudes during the observations but there
were anomalous changes in colour during the first few days after optical
identification when the I band flux decreased slightly while fluxes in other
bands increased. Spectral analysis of the BVRI broadband photometry show
evidence of a variable excess in the R and I bands. We suggest that this may be
due to synchrotron emission in matter flowing out of the system and note that
similar processes may have been responsible for anomalous V and I band
measurements in 1998 of the persistent millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX

Ultracool dwarfs,"We present results of modeling of spectra of M-, L-, T-dwarfs. Theoretical
spectra are fitted to observed spectra to study the main parameters of the
low-mass objects beyond the bottom of Main Sequence. Application of ``lithium''
and ``deuterium'' tests for assessment of ultra-cool dwarfs are discussed.",2005-06-13T08:38:42Z
The Diffuse Nature of Stromgren Spheres,"In this Letter, we argue that the standard analytical derivations of
properties of HII regions, such as the speed, shape and asymptotic position of
ionisation fronts require a more precise treatment. These derivations use the
on the spot approximation, which in effect ignores the diffuse component of the
radiation field. We show that, in fact, HII regions are diffusion dominated.
This has as a result that the morphology of inhomogeneous HII regions will be
drastically different, because shadowing effects have a less profound impact on
the apparent shape. Moreover, it will have influence on the propagation speed
of ionisation fronts. We quantify our claims by analytically deriving the
internal radiation structure of HII regions, taking diffusion fully into
account for several different cosmologically relevant density distributions.",2005-06-27T12:09:33Z
Estimating Dark Matter Distributions,"Thanks to instrumental advances, new, very large kinematic datasets for
nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are on the horizon. A key aim of these
datasets is to help determine the distribution of dark matter in these
galaxies. Past analyses have generally relied on specific dynamical models or
highly restrictive dynamical assumptions. We describe a new, non-parametric
analysis of the kinematics of nearby dSph galaxies designed to take full
advantage of the future large datasets. The method takes as input the projected
positions and radial velocities of stars known to be members of the galaxies,
but does not use any parametric dynamical model, nor the assumption that the
mass distribution follows that of the visible matter. The problem of estimating
the radial mass distribution, M(r) (the mass interior to true radius r), is
converted into a problem of estimating a regression function
non-parametrically. From the Jeans Equation we show that the unknown regression
function is subject to fundamental shape restrictions which we exploit in our
analysis using statistical techniques borrowed from isotonic estimation and
spline smoothing. Simulations indicate that M(r) can be estimated to within a
factor of two or better with samples as small as 1000 stars over almost the
entire radial range sampled by the kinematic data. The technique is applied to
a sample of 181 stars in the Fornax dSph galaxy. We show that the galaxy
contains a significant, extended dark halo some ten times more massive than its
baryonic component. Though applied here to dSph kinematics, this approach can
be used in the analysis of any kinematically hot stellar system in which the
radial velocity field is discretely sampled.",2005-04-11T18:11:51Z
"Post-glitch variability in the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1RXS
  J170849.0-400910","We report on the first XMM-Newton observation of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar
1RXS J170849.0-400910. The source was observed in 2003 August and was found at
a flux level a factor of about two lower than previous observations. Moreover,
a significant spectral evolution appears to be present, the source exhibiting a
much softer spectrum than in the past. Comparison of the present properties of
1RXS J170849.0-400910 with those from archival data shows a clear correlation
between the X-ray flux and the spectral hardness. In particular, the flux and
the spectral hardness reached a maximum level close to the two glitches the
source experienced in 1999 and in 2001, and successively decreased. Although
the excellent XMM-Newton spectral resolution should in principle allow us to
detect the absorption line reported in a phase-resolved spectrum with BeppoSAX
and interpreted as a cyclotron feature, we found no absorption features,
neither in the phase averaged spectrum nor in the phase resolved spectra. We
discuss in detail both the possibilities that the feature in the BeppoSAX data
may have resulted from a spurious detection or that it is real and
intrinsically variable. We then discuss a possible explanation for the glitches
and for the softening of the source emission which followed the flux decrease,
in the framework of the magnetar model.",2005-05-19T12:06:37Z
"A short gamma-ray burst apparently asssociated with an elliptical galaxy
  at redshift z=0.225","Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are bright, brief flashes of high energy photons that
have fascinated scientists for 30 years. They come in two classes: long (>2 s),
softspectrum bursts and short, hard events. The major progress to date on
understanding GRBs has been for long bursts which are typically at high
redshift (z ~ 1) and are in sub-luminous star-forming host galaxies. They are
likely produced in core-collapse explosions of massive stars. Until the present
observation, no short GRB had been accurately (<10"") and rapidly (minutes)
located. Here we report the detection of X-ray afterglow from and the
localization of short burst GRB050509b. Its position on the sky is near a
luminous, non-starforming elliptical galaxy at a redshift of 0.225, exactly the
type of location one would expect if the origin of this GRB is the
long-proposed fiery merger of neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) binaries.
The X-ray afterglow is found to be weak and fading below detection within a few
hours and no optical afterglow is detected to stringent limits, explaining the
past difficulty in localizing short GRBs.",2005-05-31T18:57:50Z
"The discovery of a galaxy-wide superwind from a young massive galaxy at
  redshift z~3","High-velocity galactic outflows, driven by intense bursts of star formation
and black hole accretion, are invoked by current theories of galaxy formation
to terminate star formation in the most massive galaxies and to deposit heavy
elements in the intergalactic medium. From existing observational evidence on
high-redshift galaxies, it is unclear whether such outflows are localized to
regions of intense star formation just a few kiloparsecs in extent, or whether
they instead have a significant impact on the entire galaxy and its
surroundings. Here we present two-dimensional spectroscopy of a star-forming
galaxy at redshift z=3.09 (seen 11.5 Gyr ago, when the Universe was 20 per cent
of its current age): its spatially extended Ly-alpha emission appears to be
absorbed by HI in a foreground screen covering the entire galaxy, with a
lateral extent of at least 100 kpc and remarkable velocity coherence. It was
plausibly ejected from the galaxy during a starburst several 1E8 yr earlier and
has subsequently swept up gas from the surrounding intergalactic medium and
cooled. This demonstrates the galaxy-wide impact of high-redshift superwinds.",2005-07-13T08:35:33Z
"The Dog on the Ship: The ""Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy"" as an Outlying Part
  of the Argo Star System","Overdensities in the distribution of low latitude, 2MASS giant stars are
revealed by systematically peeling away from sky maps the bulk of the giant
stars conforming to ``isotropic'' density laws generally accounting for known
Milky Way components. This procedure, combined with a higher resolution
treatment of the sky density of both giants and dust allows us to probe to
lower Galactic latitudes than previous 2MASS giant star studies. While the
results show the swath of excess giants previously associated with the
Monoceros ring system in the second and third Galactic quadrants at distances
of 6-20 kpc, we also find a several times larger overdensity of giants in the
same distance range concentrated in the direction of the ancient constellation
Argo. Isodensity contours of the large structure suggest that it is highly
elongated and inclined by about 3 deg to the disk, although details of the
structure -- including the actual location of highest density, overall extent,
true shape -- and its origin, remain unknown because only a fraction of it lies
outside highly dust-obscured, low latitude regions. Nevertheless, our results
suggest that the 2MASS M giant overdensity previously claimed to represent the
core of a dwarf galaxy in Canis Major (l ~ 240 deg) is an artifact of a dust
extinction window opening to the overall density rise to the more significant
Argo structure centered at larger longitude (l ~ 290 +- 10 deg, b ~ -4 +- 2
deg).",2005-04-05T18:33:58Z
"Chandra observation of the fast X-ray transient IGR J17544-2619:
  evidence for a neutron star?","IGR J17544-2619 belongs to a distinct group of at least seven fast X-ray
transients that cannot readily be associated with nearby flare stars or
pre-main sequence stars and most probably are X-ray binaries with wind
accretion. Sofar, the nature of the accretor has been determined in only one
case (SAX J1819.3-2525/V4641 Sgr). We carried out a 20 ks Chandra ACIS-S
observation of IGR J17544-2619 which shows the source in quiescence going into
outburst. The Chandra position confirms the previous tentative identification
of the optical counterpart, a blue O9Ib supergiant at 3 to 4 kpc (Pellizza,
Chaty & Negueruela, in prep.). This is the first detection of a fast X-ray
transient in quiescence. The quiescent spectrum is very soft. The photon index
of 5.9+/-1.2 (90% confidence error margin) is much softer than 6 quiescent
black hole candidates that were observed with Chandra ACIS-S (Kong et al. 2002;
Tomsick et al. 2003). Assuming that a significant fraction of the quiescent
photons comes from the accretor and not the donor star, we infer that the
accretor probably is a neutron star. A fit to the quiescent spectrum of the
neutron star atmosphere model developed by Pavlov et al. (1992) and Zavlin et
al. (1996) implies an unabsorbed quiescent 0.5--10 keV luminosity of
(5.2+/-1.3) x 10^32 erg/s. We speculate on the nature of the brief outbursts.",2005-08-10T15:58:13Z
Kink Stability of Isothermal Spherical Self-Similar Flow Revisited,"The problem of kink stability of isothermal spherical self-similar flow in
newtonian gravity is revisited. Using distribution theory we first develop a
general formula of perturbations, linear or non-linear, which consists of three
sets of differential equations, one in each side of the sonic line and the
other along it. By solving the equations along the sonic line we find
explicitly the spectrum, $k$, of the perturbations, whereby we obtain the
stability criterion for the self-similar solutions. When the solutions are
smoothly across the sonic line, our results reduce to those of Ori and Piran.
To show such obtained perturbations can be matched to the ones in the regions
outside the sonic line, we study the linear perturbations in the external
region of the sonic line (the ones in the internal region are identically
zero), by taking the solutions obtained along the line as the boundary
conditions. After properly imposing other boundary conditions at spatial
infinity, we are able to show that linear perturbations, satisfying all the
boundary conditions, exist and do not impose any additional conditions on $k$.
As a result, the complete treatment of perturbations in the whole spacetime
does not alter the spectrum obtained by considering the perturbations only
along the sonic line.",2005-04-20T20:04:16Z
Constraints on backreaction in dust universes,"We study backreaction in dust universes using exact equations which do not
rely on perturbation theory, concentrating on theoretical and observational
constraints. In particular, we discuss the recent suggestion (in
hep-th/0503117) that superhorizon perturbations could explain present-day
accelerated expansion as a useful example which can be ruled out. We note that
a backreaction explanation of late-time acceleration will have to involve
spatial curvature and subhorizon perturbations.",2005-04-01T20:37:04Z
The NII spectrum of the Orion Nebula,"The predicted emission spectrum of NII is compared with observations of
permitted lines in the Orion nebula. Conventional nebular models show that the
intensities of the more intense lines can be explained by fluorescence of
starlight absorption with a N abundance that is consistent with forbidden
lines. Lines excited mostly by recombination on the other hand predict high N
abundances. The effects of stellar and nebular parameters and of the atomic
data on the predicted intensities are examined.",2005-06-23T23:53:09Z
"W Hya through the eye of Odin Satellite observations of circumstellar
  submillimetre H$_2$O line emission","We present Odin observations of the AGB star W Hya in the ground-state
transition of ortho-H2O, 1(10)-1(01), at 557GHz. The line is clearly of
circumstellar origin. Radiative transfer modelling of the water lines observed
by Odin and ISO results in a mass-loss rate of (2.5 +/- 0.5)E-7 Msol/yr, and a
circumstellar H2O abundance of (2.0 +/- 1.0)E-3. The inferred mass-loss rate is
consistent with that obtained from modelling the circumstellar CO radio line
emission, and also with that obtained from the dust emission modelling combined
with a dynamical model for the outflow. The very high water abundance, higher
than the cosmic oxygen abundance, can be explained by invoking an injection of
excess water from evaporating icy bodies in the system. The required extra mass
of water is quite small, on the order of ~ 0.1 earth mass.",2005-05-11T10:28:09Z
"Optical identification of ISO far-infrared sources in the Lockman Hole
  using a deep VLA 1.4 GHz continuum survey","By exploiting the far-infrared(FIR) and radio correlation, we have performed
the Likelihood-Ratio analysis to identify optical counterparts to the
far-infrared sources in the Lockman Hole. Using the likelihood ratio analysis
and the associated reliability, 44 FIR sources have been identified with radio
sources. Redshifts have been obtained for 29 out of 44 identified sources. One
hyper-luminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) with and four ultraluminous infrared
galaxies (ULIRGs) are identified in our sample. The space density of the FIR
sources at z = 0.3-0.6 is 4.6\times 10^{-5}Mpc^{-3}, implying a rapid evolution
of the ULIRG population. Most of \ISO FIR sources have their FIR-radio ratios
similar to star-forming galaxies ARP 220 and M82. At least seven of our FIR
sources show evidence for the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in
optical emission lines, radio continuum excess, or X-ray activity. Three out of
five (60%) of the ULIRG/HyLIRGs are AGN galaxies. Five of the seven AGN
galaxies are within the ROSAT X-ray survey field, and two are within the
XMM-Newton survey fields. X-ray emission has been detected in only one source,
1EX030, which is optically classified as a quasar. The non-detection in the
XMM-Newton 2-10 keV band suggests a very thick absorption obscuring the central
source of the two AGN galaxies. Several sources have an extreme FIR luminosity
relative to the optical R-band, L(90\mu\mathrm{m})/L(R) > 500, which is rare
even among the local ULIRG population. While source confusion or blending might
offer an explanation in some cases, they may represent a new population of
galaxies with an extreme activity of star formation in an undeveloped stellar
system -- i.e., formation of bulges or young ellipticals.",2005-07-11T08:14:26Z
Evidence for a Starburst within 9 pc of the Active Nucleus of NGC 1097,"We report evidence for a recent burst of star formation located within 9 pc
of the active nucleus of NGC 1097. The observational signatures of the
starburst include UV absorption lines and continuum emission from young stars
observed in a small-aperture HST spectrum. The burst is a few times 10^6 yr
old, has a mass of approximately 10^6 solar masses, an observed luminosity of
1.5 x 10^7 solar luminosities and is obscured by approximately 3 visual
magnitudes. The importance of this finding is two-fold: (1) the proximity of
the starburst to the active nucleus and thus possible association with it; (2)
its obscuration by and apparent association with a dusty absorbing medium,
while the broad emission lines appear unobscured, suggesting that the starburst
could be embedded in a circumnuclear torus as predicted in the Unified Model of
active galactic nuclei.",2005-03-28T13:58:45Z
Cosmological Parameters from the 2003 flight of BOOMERANG,"We present the cosmological parameters from the CMB intensity and
polarization power spectra of the 2003 Antarctic flight of the BOOMERANG
telescope. The BOOMERANG data alone constrains the parameters of the
$\Lambda$CDM model remarkably well and is consistent with constraints from a
multi-experiment combined CMB data set. We add LSS data from the 2dF and SDSS
redshift surveys to the combined CMB data set and test several extensions to
the standard model including: running of the spectral index, curvature, tensor
modes, the effect of massive neutrinos, and an effective equation of state for
dark energy. We also include an analysis of constraints to a model which allows
a CDM isocurvature admixture.",2005-07-21T17:15:31Z
A Simple Measurement of Turbulence in Cores of Galaxy Clusters,"Using a simple model, we study the effects of turbulence on the motion of
bubbles produced by AGN jet activities in the core of a galaxy cluster. We
focus on the turbulence with scales larger then the size of the bubbles. We
show that for a bubble pair with an age of ~10^8 yr, the projected angle
between the two vectors from the cluster center to the two bubbles should be ~>
90 degree and the ratio of their projected distances from the cluster center
should be ~< 2.5, if the velocity and scale of the turbulence are ~250 km s^-1
and ~20 kpc, respectively. The positions of the bubbles observed in the Perseus
cluster suggest that the turbulent velocity is ~>100 km s^-1 for the cluster.",2005-08-10T20:04:55Z
Rapid Dissipation of Primordial Gas from the AU Microscopii Debris Disk,"The disk around AU Microscopii, an M1 star in the Beta Pictoris Moving Group,
is extraordinarily well-suited for comparison to the Beta Pic debris disk (type
A5V). We use far-UV absorption spectroscopy of AU Mic to probe its edge-on disk
for small amounts of molecular hydrogen, the primary constituent of gas giant
planets. Our conservative upper limit on the line-of-sight H_2 column density
is 1.7 x 10^{19} cm^{-2}, which is 18.5 times lower than the limit obtained
from non-detection of sub-mm CO emission (Liu et al. 2004). In addition, there
is a hint of H_2 absorption at a column density an order of magnitude or more
below our upper limit. The H_2-to-dust ratio in the AU Mic disk is < 6:1,
similar to that in the Beta Pic disk. This shows that the primordial gas has
largely been dissipated in less than about 12 Myr for both disks, despite their
very different stellar masses and luminosities. It is extremely difficult to
form a giant planet around AU Mic with current core-accretion scenarios in such
a short time.",2005-05-13T21:40:43Z
Issues with Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitor Models,"The status of core collapse supernoova progenitor models is reviewed with a
focus on some of the current uncertainties arising from the difficulties of
modeling important macrophysics and microphysics. In particular, I look at
issues concerned with modeling convection, the implications of the still
uncertain 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate, the uncertainties involved with
the incorporation of mass loss, rotation, and magnetic fields in the stellar
models, and the possible generation of global instabilities in stellar models
at the late evolutionary stages.",2005-06-14T16:42:51Z
"Hard Extended X-ray Source in the IC 443 SNR Resolved by Chandra: A Fast
  Ejecta Fragment or a New Pulsar Wind Nebula?","A Chandra observation of the isolated hard X-ray source XMMU
J061804.3+222732, located in the region of apparent interaction of the
supernova remnant IC 443 with a molecular cloud, resolved the complex structure
of the source in a few bright clumps embedded in an extended emission of a ~ 30
arcsec size. The X-ray spectra of the clumps and the extended emission are
dominated by a hard power-law component with a photon index of 1.2--1.4. In
addition, we see some indications of an optically thin thermal plasma of a ~
0.3 keV temperature. The observed X-ray morphology and spectra are consistent
with those expected for an isolated supernova ejecta fragment interacting with
a dense ambient medium. A possible alternative interpretation is a pulsar wind
nebula associated with either IC 443 or another SNR, G189.6+3.3.",2005-03-31T17:57:57Z
"Extending the Search for Counterrotating Gas and Stars in Galaxies: A
  Study of Late-Type Dwarfs","In a previous study on gas-stellar counterrotation for a large sample of E/S0
and spiral galaxies (Kannappan & Fabricant 2001), two dwarf irregular galaxies
were included, of which one was tentatively identified as a counterrotator.
Here we extend the search for counterrotation to include 10 more
irregular/spiral dwarf galaxies. We find that all systems with well defined gas
and stellar rotation show kinematics consistent with co-rotation. However, we
see evidence of decoupled gas and stellar kinematics in >~ 50% of the sample,
possibly reflecting minor interactions too small to create large-scale
gas-stellar counterrotation.",2005-07-21T06:07:34Z
HI Observations of SA 68-6597: the faintest Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy,"Blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) are faint (M(B) < -17 mag) compact (R <1
kpc), at least qualitatively very blue galaxies due to active star formation,
and have low metallicities. Found serendipitously as part of a redshift survey
of faint galaxies with the Keck Telescope (DEEP), SA 68-6597 is at a distance
of 80 Mpc, and is one of the faintest, -12.4 mag, lowest metallicity, ~0.05
Z(sun), BCDs known. Its H-beta linewidth of sigma =27 km/s and small size,
R(eff) ~ 190 pc, suggest that it is an extremely low mass galaxy. We have used
the Arecibo telescope to measure the HI properties of SA 68-6597 in order to
better constrain its total mass and its potential for future star formation. SA
68-6597 has a M(HI) = (1.4+-0.4)x10^7 M(sun) and an HI FWHM linewidth of
33$\pm^{60}_{12}$. Combining the HI linewidth with an estimate of the size of
the HI disk, we derive a M(dyn)>~3x10^7 M(sun). The M(HI)/L(B)=1.0+-0.3
M(sun)/L(sun), M(dyn)/L(B) >= 2 M(sun)/L(sun) and M(HI)/M(dyn) <~ 0.47 values
are typical for BCDs. Combining the measured star formation rate of 0.003
M(sun)/yr with the HI mass, we derive a gas depletion timescale of 5+-2 Gyr.
While SA 68-6597 is a fainter, lower-mass, higher metallicity counterpart to
other BCDs like I Zw 18 and SBS 0335-052, its HI properties suggest it will not
evolve dramatically in the near future. Given the limits on its gaseous and
dynamical masses, SA 68-6597 may be able to evolve into a moderately massive
dwarf spheroidal galaxy.",2005-07-27T22:43:37Z
The Galactic globular cluster system as a fossil record of reionization,"We propose that structural, kinematical, and chemical properties of the
Galactic globular clusters (GCs) can contain fossil information of the cosmic
reionization history. We first summarize possible observational evidences for
the influence of reionization on the Galactic GC formation. We then show how
structural properties of the GC system (GCS) in the Galaxy can be influenced by
suppression of GC formation due to reionization during the Galaxy formation
through hierarchical merging of subgalactic clumps, by using numerical
simulations with and without suppression of GC formation by reionization. In
particular, we show that if GC formation in dwarf galaxies that are building
blocks of the Galaxy and virialized after reionization era ($z_{reion}$) are
completely suppressed, the present-day radial distribution of the Galactic GCs
depends strongly on $z_{reion}$. Our numerical results imply that if GC
formation after $z_{reion}$ $\sim$ 15 is strongly suppressed, the origin of the
observed structural properties of the Galactic GCS can be more naturally
explained in the framework of the hierarchical clustering scenario.",2005-06-22T09:03:51Z
"Exclusion Limits on the WIMP-Nucleon Cross-Section from the First Run of
  the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search in the Soudan Underground Lab","The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS-II) employs low-temperature Ge and Si
detectors to seek Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) via their
elastic scattering interactions with nuclei. Simultaneous measurements of both
ionization and phonon energy provide discrimination against interactions of
background particles. For recoil energies above 10 keV, events due to
background photons are rejected with >99.99% efficiency. Electromagnetic events
very near the detector surface can mimic nuclear recoils because of reduced
charge collection, but these surface events are rejected with >96% efficiency
by using additional information from the phonon pulse shape. Efficient use of
active and passive shielding, combined with the the 2090 m.w.e. overburden at
the experimental site in the Soudan mine, makes the background from neutrons
negligible for this first exposure. All cuts are determined in a blind manner
from in situ calibrations with external radioactive sources without any prior
knowledge of the event distribution in the signal region. Resulting
efficiencies are known to ~10%. A single event with a recoil of 64 keV passes
all of the cuts and is consistent with the expected misidentification rate of
surface-electron recoils. Under the assumptions for a standard dark matter
halo, these data exclude previously unexplored parameter space for both
spin-independent and spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering. The
resulting limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic-scattering
cross-section has a minimum of 4x10^-43 cm^2 at a WIMP mass of 60 GeV/c^2. The
minimum of the limit for the spin-dependent WIMP-neutron elastic-scattering
cross-section is 2x10^-37 cm^2 at a WIMP mass of 50 GeV/c^2.",2005-07-08T00:33:21Z
Equation of state for Universe from similarity symmetries,"In this paper we proposed to use the group of analysis of symmetries of the
dynamical system to describe the evolution of the Universe. This methods is
used in searching for the unknown equation of state. It is shown that group of
symmetries enforce the form of the equation of state for noninteracting scaling
multifluids. We showed that symmetries give rise the equation of state in the
form $p=-\Lambda+w_{1}\rho(a)+w_{2}a^{\beta}+0$ and energy density
$\rho=\Lambda+\rho_{01}a^{-3(1+w)}+\rho_{02}a^{\beta}+\rho_{03}a^{-3}$, which
is commonly used in cosmology. The FRW model filled with scaling fluid (called
homological) is confronted with the observations of distant type Ia supernovae.
We found the class of model parameters admissible by the statistical analysis
of SNIa data. We showed that the model with scaling fluid fits well to
supernovae data. We found that $\Omega_{\text{m},0} \simeq 0.4$ and $n \simeq
-1$ ($\beta = -3n$), which can correspond to (hyper) phantom fluid, and to a
high density universe. However if we assume prior that
$\Omega_{\text{m},0}=0.3$ then the favoured model is close to concordance
$\Lambda$CDM model. Our results predict that in the considered model with
scaling fluids distant type Ia supernovae should be brighter than in
$\Lambda$CDM model, while intermediate distant SNIa should be fainter than in
$\Lambda$CDM model. We also investigate whether the model with scaling fluid is
actually preferred by data over $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result we find from
the Akaike model selection criterion prefers the model with noninteracting
scaling fluid.",2005-05-10T16:56:00Z
"Three-body encounters in the Galactic centre: the origin of the
  hypervelocity star SDSS J090745.0+024507","Hills (1988) predicted that runaway stars could be accelerated to velocities
larger than 1000 km/s by dynamical encounters with the supermassive black hole
(SMBH) in the Galactic center. The recently discovered hypervelocity star SDSS
J090745.0+024507 (hereafter HVS) is escaping the Galaxy at high speed and could
be the first object in this class. With the measured radial velocity and the
estimated distance to the HVS, we trace back its trajectory in the Galactic
potential. Assuming it was ejected from the center, we find that a $\sim$ 2
mas/yr proper motion is necessary for the star to have come within a few
parsecs of the SMBH. We perform three-body scattering experiments to constrain
the progenitor encounter which accelerated the HVS. As proposed by Yu &
Tremaine (2003), we consider the tidal disruption of binary systems by the SMBH
and the encounter between a star and a binary black hole, as well as an
alternative scenario involving intermediate mass black holes. We find that the
tidal disruption of a stellar binary ejects stars with a larger velocity
compared to the encounter between a single star and a binary black hole, but
has a somewhat smaller ejection rate due to the greater availability of single
stars.",2005-07-15T08:29:45Z
"Flux of light antimatter nuclei near earth, induced by Cosmic Rays in
  the Galaxy and in the atmosphere","The fluxes of light antinuclei A<=4 induced near earth by Cosmic Ray intera
ctions with the interstellar matter in the Galaxy and with the Earth
atmosphere, are calculated in a phenomenological framework. The hadronic
production cross section for antinucleons is based on a recent parametrization
of a wide set of accelerator data. The production of light nuclei is calculated
using coalescence models. For the standard coalescence model, the coalescence
radius is fitted to the available experimental data. The non annihilating
inelastic scattering process for the antideuterons is discussed and taken into
account for the first time via a more realistic procedure than used so far for
antiprotons.",2005-03-24T15:23:32Z
"Smoothing Supernova Data to Reconstruct the Expansion History of the
  Universe and its Age","We propose a non-parametric method of smoothing supernova data over redshift
using a Gaussian kernel in order to reconstruct important cosmological
quantities including H(z) and w(z) in a model independent manner. This method
is shown to be successful in discriminating between different models of dark
energy when the quality of data is commensurate with that expected from the
future SuperNova Acceleration Probe (SNAP). We find that the Hubble parameter
is especially well-determined and useful for this purpose. The look back time
of the universe may also be determined to a very high degree of accuracy (\lleq
0.2 %) in this method. By refining the method, it is also possible to obtain
reasonable bounds on the equation of state of dark energy. We explore a new
diagnostic of dark energy-- the `w-probe'-- which can be calculated from the
first derivative of the data. We find that this diagnostic is reconstructed
extremely accurately for different reconstruction methods even if \Omega_m is
marginalized over. The w-probe can be used to successfully distinguish between
$\Lambda$CDM and other models of dark energy to a high degree of accuracy.",2005-05-16T20:01:52Z
"Model-Independent Multi-Variable Gamma-Ray Burst Luminosity Indicator
  and Its Possible Cosmological Implications","We present a multi-variable regression analysis to several observable
quantities for a sample of 15 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The observables used in
the analysis includes the isotropic gamma-ray energy (E_{gamma,iso}), the peak
energy of the nu F_nu spectrum in the rest frame (E_p'), and the rest frame
break time of the optical afterglow light curves(t_b'). A strong dependence of
E_{gamma, iso on E_p' and t_b' is derived. We also extend the analysis to the
isotropic afterglow energies in the X-ray and the optical bands, respectively,
and find that they are essentially not correlated with E_p' and t_b'. Regarding
the E_{gamma, iso(E_p', t_b') relationship as a luminosity indicator, we
explore the possible constraints on the cosmological parameters using the GRB
sample. Our results indicate 0.13<omega_M<0.49 and 0.50<Omega_Lambda<0.85 for a
flat Universe. The decelerating factor and its cosmological evolution, and the
transition redshift are also investigated. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we
find that the GRB sample satisfying our relationship observationally tends to
be a soft and bright one, and that the contraints on the cosmological
parameters can be much improved either by the enlargement of the sample size or
by the increase of the observational precision. Furthermore, the detections of
a few high redshift GRBs satisfying the correlation could greatly tighten the
constraints (abridged).",2005-04-19T01:23:38Z
"An XMM-Newton observation of the multiple system HD167971 (O5-8V + O5-8V
  + (O8I)) and the young open cluster NGC6604","We discuss the results of two XMM-Newton observations of the open cluster
NGC6604 obtained in April and September 2002. We concentrate mainly on the
multiple system HD167971 (O5-8V + O5-8V + (O8I)). The soft part of the EPIC
spectrum of this system is thermal with typical temperatures of about 2 10^6 to
9 10^6 K. The nature (thermal vs non-thermal) of the hard part of the spectrum
is not unambiguously revealed by our data. If the emission is thermal, the high
temperature of the plasma (~ 2.3 10^7 to 4.6 10^7 K) would be typical of what
should be expected from a wind-wind interaction zone within a long period
binary system. This emission could arise from an interaction between the
combined winds of the O5-8V + O5-8V close binary system and that of the more
distant O8I companion. Assuming instead that the hard part of the spectrum is
non-thermal, the photon index would be rather steep (~3). Moreover, a marginal
variability between our two XMM-Newton pointings could be attributed to an
eclipse of the O5-8V + O5-8V system. The overall X-ray luminosity points to a
significant X-ray luminosity excess of about a factor 4 possibly due to
colliding winds. Considering HD167971 along with several recent X-ray and radio
observations, we propose that the simultaneous observation of non-thermal
radiation in the X-ray (below 10.0 keV) and radio domains appears rather
unlikely. Our investigation of our XMM-Newton data of NGC6604 reveals a rather
sparse distribution of X-ray emitters. Including the two bright non-thermal
radio emitters HD168112 and HD167971, we present a list of 31 X-ray sources...

Probing the Shape of the Galactic Halo with Hyper-Velocity Stars,"Precise proper motion measurements (sigma_mu ~ 10 mkas/yr) of the recently
discovered hyper-velocity star (HVS) SDSS J090745.0+024507 would yield
significant constraints on the axis ratios and orientation of a triaxial model
for the Galactic halo. Triaxiality of dark matter halos is predicted by Cold
Dark Matter models of galaxy formation and may be used to probe the nature of
dark matter. However, unless the distance to this star is determined to better
than 10%, these constraints suffer from one-dimensional degeneracies, which we
quantify. We show how proper motion measurements of several HVSs could
simultaneously resolve the distance degeneracies of all such stars and produce
a detailed picture of the triaxial halo. Additional HVSs may be found from
radial velocity surveys or from parallax/proper-motion data derived from GAIA.
High-precision proper-motion measurements of these stars using the Space
Interferometry Mission (SIM PlanetQuest) would substantially tighten the
constraints they yield on the Galactic potential.",2005-06-30T16:24:49Z
Interaction between Physics and Cosmology,"Recent results indicate the presence of a cosmological constant (or related
dark energy) in the universe. It has been conjectured recently that the
interaction parameters of physical theories may be dependant on the size
parameter of the universe, related to the cosmological constant. We investigate
whether such effects will help in explaining baryogenesis in early universe.
They do seem to succeed.",2005-06-30T08:14:46Z
Z-bursts from the Virgo cluster,"Resonant annihilation of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos (UHECnu) on the
cosmic neutrino background (CnuB) into Z bosons--the Z-burst mechanism--and its
associated absorption and emission phenomenology provide a unique, albeit
indirect, probe of the CnuB in its present state. In this paper, we examine the
implications of gravitational clustering of the CnuB in nearby galaxy clusters
for the Z-burst phenomenology. In particular, we study the emission features of
the Z-decay products originating from the Virgo cluster, and the potential of
future cosmic ray experiments to observe clustering-enhanced Z-burst rates. We
find that a detector with an exposure equivalent to three years of observations
at the Extreme Universe Space Observatory (EUSO) will very likely measure these
enhanced rates together with the associated UHECnu flux, provided that the
latter saturates current observational limits and the neutrino masses are
quasi-degenerate, m_nu_i < 0.1 eV. In the case of UHECnu fluxes below the
electromagnetic cascade limit, or a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum, an
experimental sensitivity exceeding that of EUSO by at least two orders of
magnitude is required to detect the clustering enhancements with any certainty.",2005-05-27T17:27:17Z
Duality extended Chaplygin cosmologies with a big rip,"We consider modifications to the Friedmann equation motivated by recent
proposals along these lines pursuing an explanation to the observed late time
acceleration. Here we show those modifications can be framed within a theory
with self-interacting gravity, where the term self-interaction refers here to
the presence of functions of $\rho$ and $p$ in the right hand side of the
Einstein equations. We then discuss the construction of the duals of the
cosmologies generated within that framework. After that we investigate the
modifications required to generate generalized and modified Chaplygin
cosmologies and show that their duals belong to a larger family of cosmologies
we call extended Chaplygin cosmologies. Finally, by letting the parameters of
those models take values not earlier considered in the literature we show some
representatives of that family of cosmologies display sudden future
singularities, which indicates their behavior is rather different from
generalized or modified Chaplygin gas cosmologies. This reinforces the idea
that modifications of gravity can be responsible for unexpected evolutionary
features in the universe.",2005-05-12T12:19:04Z
"A ""UV+IR"" history of star formation at 0<z<1","The combination of both contributions from the observed UV emission and the
absorbed radiations reprocessed in the infrared represents the ideal approach
to constrain the activity of massive star formation in galaxies. Using recent
results from GALEX and Spitzer, we compare the evolutions of the UV and IR
energy densities with redshift as well as their contributions to the star
formation history at 0<z<1. We find that the comoving IR luminosity is
characterized by a much faster evolution than seen in the UV. Our results also
indicate that ~70% of the star-forming activity at z~1 is produced by the
so-called IR-luminous sources (L_IR > 10^11 L_sol).",2005-06-20T16:59:56Z
"The Optical - Infrared Colors of CORALS QSOs: Searching for Dust
  Reddening Associated With High Redshift Damped Lyman Alpha Systems","The presence of dust in quasar absorbers, such as damped Lyman alpha (DLA)
systems, may cause the background QSO to appear reddened. We investigate the
extent of this potential reddening by comparing the optical-to-infrared (IR)
colors of QSOs with and without intervening absorbers. Our QSO sample is based
on the Complete Optical and Radio Absorption Line System (CORALS) survey of
Ellison et al (2001). We have obtained near-simultaneous B and K band
magnitudes for subset of the CORALS sample and supplemented our observations
with further measurements published in the literature. To account for
redshift-related color changes, the B-K colors are normalized using the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) QSO composite. The mean normalized B-K color of the
DLA sub-sample is +0.12, whereas the mean for the no-DLA sample is -0.10; both
distributions have RMS scatters ~0.5. Neither a student's T-test nor a KS test
indicate that there is any significant difference between the two color
distributions. Based on simulations which redden the colors of QSOs with
intervening DLAs, we determine a reddening limit which corresponds to E(B-V) <
0.04 (SMC-like extinction) at 99% confidence (3 sigma), assuming that E(B-V) is
the same for all DLAs. Finally, we do not find any general correlation between
absorber properties (such as [Fe/Zn] or neutral hydrogen column density) and
B-K color. One of these two QSOs shows evidence for strong associated
absorption from X-ray observations, an alternative explanation for its very red
color. We conclude that the presence of intervening galaxies causes a minimal
reddening of the background QSO.",2005-07-18T20:05:30Z
"Search for Extra-Terrestrial planets: The DARWIN mission - Target Stars
  and Array Architectures","The DARWIN mission is an Infrared free flying interferometer mission based on
the new technique of nulling interferometry. Its main objective is to detect
and characterize other Earth-like planets, analyze the composition of their
atmospheres and their capability to sustain life, as we know it. DARWIN is
currently in definition phase. This PhD work that has been undertaken within
the DARWIN team at the European Space Agency (ESA) addresses two crucial
aspects of the mission. Firstly, a DARWIN target star list has been established
that includes characteristics of the target star sample that will be critical
for final mission design, such as, luminosity, distance, spectral
classification, stellar variability, multiplicity, location and radius of the
star. Constrains were applied as set by planet evolution theory and mission
architecture. Secondly, a number of alternative mission architectures have been
evaluated on the basis of interferometer response as a function of wavelength,
achievable modulation efficiency, number of telescopes and starlight rejection
capabilities. The study has shown that the core mission goals should be
achievable with a lower level of complexity as compared to the current baseline
configuration.",2005-04-22T12:39:07Z
Identifying Near Earth Object Families,"The study of asteroid families has provided tremendous insight into the
forces that sculpted the main belt and continue to drive the collisional and
dynamical evolution of asteroids. The identification of asteroid families
within the NEO population could provide a similar boon to studies of their
formation and interiors. In this study we examine the purported identification
of NEO families by Drummond (2000) and conclude that it is unlikely that they
are anything more than random fluctuations in the distribution of NEO
osculating orbital elements. We arrive at this conclusion after examining the
expected formation rate of NEO families, the identification of NEO groups in
synthetic populations that contain no genetically related NEOs, the orbital
evolution of the largest association identified by Drummond (2000), and the
decoherence of synthetic NEO families intended to reproduce the observed
members of the same association. These studies allowed us to identify a new
criterion that can be used to select real NEO families for further study in
future analyses, based on the ratio of the number of pairs and the size of
strings to the number of objects in an identified association.",2005-05-12T23:11:58Z
"Recovery of the orbital parameters and pulse evolution of V0332+53
  during a huge outburst","The high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) V0332+53 became active at the end of 2004
and the outburst was observed at hard X-rays by RXTE and INTEGRAL. Based on
these hard X-ray observations, the orbital parameters are measured through
fitting the Doppler-shifted spin periods. The derived orbital period and
eccentricity are consistent with those of Stella et al. (1985) obtained from
EXOSAT observations, whereas the projected semimajor axis and the periastron
longitude are found to have changed from 48$\pm$4 to 86$^{+6}_{-10}$ lt-s and
from 313$^{\circ}$$\pm$10 to 283$^{\circ}$$\pm$14, respectively. This would
indicate an angular speed of $\geq$ 1.5$^{\circ}$$\pm$0.8 yr$^{-1}$ for
rotation of the orbit over the past 21 years. The periastron passage time of
MJD 53367$\pm$1 is just around the time when the intensity reached maximum and
an orbital period earlier is the time when the outburst started. This
correlation resembles the behavior of a Type I outburst. During outburst the
source spun up with a rate of 8.01$^{+1.00}_{-1.14}$$\times10^{-6}$ s
day$^{-1}$. The evolution of pulse profile is highly intensity dependent. The
separation of double pulses remained almost constant ($\sim$ 0.47) when the
source was bright, and dropped to 0.37 within $\leq$ 3 days as the source
became weaker. The pulse evolution of V0332+53 may correlate to the change in
dominance of the emission between fan-beam and pencil-beam mechanisms.",2005-07-20T07:09:49Z
Tangled magnetic fields and CMBR signal from reionization epoch,"We compute the secondary CMBR anisotropy signal from the reionization of the
universe in the presence of tangled magnetic fields. We consider the tangled
magnetic-field-induced scalar, vector, and tensor modes for our analysis. The
most interesting signal for l<10 arise from tensor perturbations. In
particular, we show that the enhancement observed by WMAP in the TE
cross-correlation signal for l<10 could be explained by tensor TE
cross-correlation from tangled magnetic fields generated during the
inflationary epoch for magnetic field strength B_0=4.5*10^{-9}G and magnetic
field power spectrum spectral index n=-2.9. Alternatively, a mixture of tensor
mode signal with primordial scalar modes give weaker bounds on the value of the
optical depth to the reionization surface, tau_{reion}=0.11 +/- 0.02. This
analysis can also be translated to a limit on the magnetic field strength of
nearly 5*10{-9}G for wave-numbers < 0.05 Mpc^{-1}",2005-06-27T13:25:26Z
The redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts revisited,"In this letter, we calculate the redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts
assuming that they trace (i) the globally averaged star formation rate or (ii)
the average metallicity in the Universe. While at redshifts 5 and below, both
the star formation rate and metallicity are observationally determined modulo
some uncertainties, at higher redshifts there are few constraints. We
extrapolate the star formation rate and metallicity to higher redshifts and
explore models that are broadly consistent with bounds on the optical depth
from WMAP results. In addition, we also include parametric descriptions of the
luminosity function, and the typical spectrum for GRBs. With these essential
ingredients included in the modeling, we find that a substantial fraction 75%
of GRBs are expected to originate at redshifts below 4, in variance with some
previous estimates. Conversely, if we assume as expected for the collapsar
model that gamma-ray bursts favour a low metallicity environment and therefore,
relate the GRB rate to a simple model of the average metallicity as a function
of redshift, we find that a higher fraction of bursts, about 40% originate from
redshifts greater than 4. We conclude with the implications of SWIFT GRB
detections.",2005-05-24T20:37:07Z
A Puzzling Merger in A3266: the Hydrodynamic Picture from XMM-Newton,"Using the mosaic of nine XMM-Newton observations, we study the hydrodynamic
state of the merging cluster of galaxies Abell 3266. The high quality of the
spectroscopic data and large field of view of XMM-Netwon allow us to determine
the thermodynamic conditions of the intracluster medium on scales of order of
50 kpc. A high quality entropy map reveals the presence of an extended region
of low entropy gas, running from the primary cluster core toward the northeast
along the nominal merger axis. The mass of the low entropy gas amounts to
approximately 2e13 solar masses, which is comparable to the baryonic mass of
the core of a rich cluster. We test the possibility that the origin of the
observed low entropy gas is either related to the disruption a preexisting
cooling core in Abell 3266 or to the stripping of gas from an infalling
subcluster companion. We find that both the radial pressure and entropy
profiles as well as the iron abundance of Abell 3266 do not resemble those in
other known cooling core clusters (Abell 478). Thus we conclude that the low
entropy region is subcluster gas in the process of being stripped off from its
dark matter halo. In this scenario the subcluster would be falling onto the
core of A3266 from the foreground. This would also help interpret the observed
high velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the cluster center, provided that
the mass of the subcluster is at most a tenth of the mass of the main cluster.",2005-05-02T20:02:42Z
"Discovery of X-Ray Emission from Supernova 1970G with Chandra: Filling
  the Void between Supernovae and Supernova Remnants","We report on the discovery of X-ray emission from SN 1970G in M101, 35 years
after its outburst, using deep X-ray imaging with the Chandra X-ray
observatory. The Chandra ACIS spectrum shows that the emission is soft (<2 keV)
and characteristic for the reverse shock region. The X-ray luminosity (1 x
10^37 ergs/s) is likely caused by the interaction of the supernova (SN) shock
with dense circumstellar matter. If the material was deposited by the stellar
wind from the progenitor, a mass-loss rate of (2.6+/-0.4) x 10^-5 M_sun/year is
inferred. Utilizing the high-resolution Chandra ACIS data of SN 1970G and its
environment, we reconstruct the X-ray lightcurve from previous ROSAT HRI, PSPC,
and XMM-Newton EPIC observations, and find a best-fit linear rate of decline of
L \propto t^-s with index s = 1.7+/-0.6 over a period of 12-35 years after the
outburst. As the oldest SN detected in X-rays, SN 1970G allows, for the first
time, direct observation of the transition from a SN to its supernova remnant

"A compact binary merger model for the short, hard GRB 050509b","The first X-ray afterglow for a short (~30 ms), hard gamma-ray burst was
detected by Swift on 9 May 2005 (GRB 050509b). No optical or radio counterpart
was identified in follow-up observations. The tentative association of the GRB
with a nearby giant elliptical galaxy at redshift z=0.2248 would imply a total
energy release E(gamma, isotropic) ~3 x 10**48 erg, and that the progenitor had
traveled several tens of kpc from its point of origin, in agreement with
expectations linking these events to the final merger of compact binaries
driven by gravitational wave emission. We model the dynamical merger of such a
system and the time-dependent evolution of the accretion tori thus created. The
resulting energetics, variability, and expected durations are consistent with
GRB 050509b originating from the tidal disruption of a neutron star by a
stellar mass black hole, or of the merger of two neutron stars followed by
prompt gravitational collapse of the massive remnant. We discuss how the
available gamma-ray and X-ray data provide a probe for the nature of the
relativistic ejecta and the surrounding medium.",2005-06-06T03:02:13Z
A planetary system as the origin of structure in Fomalhaut's dust belt,"The Sun and >15 percent of nearby stars are surrounded by dusty debris disks
that must be collisionally replenished by asteroids and comets, as the dust
would otherwise be depleted on <10 Myr timescales (ref. 1). Theoretical studies
show that disk structure can be modified by the gravitational influence of
planets (ref. 2-4), but the observational evidence is incomplete, at least in
part because maps of the thermal infrared emission from disks have low linear
resolution (35 AU in the best case; ref. 5). Optical images provide higher
resolution, but the closest examples (AU Mic and Beta Pic) are edge-on (ref.
6,7), preventing the direct measurement of azimuthal and radial disk structure
that is required for fitting theoretical models of planetary perturbations.
Here we report the detection of optical light reflected from the dust grains
orbiting Fomalhaut (HD 216956). The system is inclined 24 degrees away from
edge-on, enabling the measurement of disk structure around its entire
circumference, at a linear resolution of 0.5 AU. The dust is distributed in a
belt 25 AU wide, with a very sharp inner edge at a radial distance of 133 AU,
and we measure an offset of 15 AU between the belt's geometric centre and
Fomalhaut. Taken together, the sharp inner edge and offset demonstrate the
presence of planet-mass objects orbiting Fomalhaut.",2005-06-23T20:53:08Z
"GRS 1915+105: the distance, radiative processes and energy-dependent
  variability","We present an exhaustive analysis of five broad-band observations of GRS
1915+105 in two variability states, chi and omega, observed simultaneously by
the PCA, HEXTE and OSSE. We find all the spectra well fitted by Comptonization
of disc blackbody photons, with very strong evidence for the presence of a
nonthermal electron component in the Comptonizing plasma. Both the energy and
the power spectra in the chi state are typical to the very high/intermediate
state of black-hole binaries. The spectrum of the omega state is characterized
by a strong blackbody component Comptonized by thermal electrons and a weak
nonthermal tail. We then calculate rms spectra (fractional variability as
functions of energy) for the PCA data. We accurately model the rms spectra by
coherent superposition of variability in the components implied by the spectral
fits, namely a less variable blackbody and more variable Comptonization. The
latter dominates at high energies, resulting in a flattening of the rms at high
energies in most of the data. This is also the case for the spectra of the QPOs
present in the chi state. Then, some of our data require a radial dependence of
the rms of the disc blackbody. We also study the distance to the source, and
find 11 kpc as the most likely value, contrary to a recent claim of a much
lower value.",2005-04-01T10:00:03Z
"""PAH"" emission bands in selected planetary nebulae: a study of the
  behaviour with gas phase C/O ratio","Airborne and space-based low-resolution spectroscopy in the 1980s discovered
tantalizing quantitative relationships between the gas phase C/O abundance
ratio in planetary nebulae (PNe) and the fractions of total far-infrared
luminosity radiated by the 7.7 and 11.3 micron bands (the C=C stretch and C-H
bend, respectively), of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Only a very small
sample of nebulae was studied in this context, limited by airborne observations
of the 7.7 micron band, or the existence of adequate IRAS Low Resolution
Spectrometer data for the 11.3 micron band. To investigate these trends
further, we have expanded the sample of planetaries available for this study
using Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) low-resolution spectra secured with the
Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) and the Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS).
The new sample of 43 PNe, of which 17 are detected in PAH emission, addresses
the range from C/O=0.2-13 with the objective of trying to delineate the
pathways by which carbon dust grains might have formed in planetaries. For the
7.7-micron and 11.3- micron bands, we confirm that the ratio of band strength
to total infrared luminosity is correlated with the nebular C/O ratio.
Expressed in equivalent width terms, the cut-on C/O ratio for the 7.7-micron
band is found to be 0.6(+0.2,-0.4), in good accord with that found from
sensitive ground-based measurements of the 3.3-micron band too.",2005-07-08T16:56:17Z
The energetic Universe,"In this paper I review the main topics on the energetic Universe that have
been put forward as main science goals in the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 exercise.
I discuss the study of matter under extreme conditions (both under strong
gravity and at ultra-high densities), the cosmology of baryons (assembly of
ordinary matter in dark-matter dominated structures and the creation of heavy
elements) and the co-eval growth of super-massive black holes and stars in
galaxies along cosmic history. Most of these topics can be addressed with a
large-aperture deep Universe X-ray space observatory that can be flown soon
after 2015, complemented by gravitational wave observatories (LISA), a
focussing gamma-ray observatory, a far infrared high-sensitivity observatory
and an X-ray survey telescope.",2005-08-09T16:25:35Z
Testing the Friedmannian magnitude-redshift relation with SNIa data,"Standard cosmology is constructed upon the (generally implicit) assumption of
the ``large scale'' homogeneity of our Universe. Now, structures are observed
at scales which become larger and larger as the observational distances
increase. However, the homogeneous Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model
remains a cosmological paradigm, and Friedmannian relations are usually used to
work out the model, implicitly assuming that the homogeneity assumption is
valid at the studied scales. This has been the way the concordance (Lambda-CDM)
model came out from the analyses of the SNIa data. Since this model implies the
validity of the Friedmannian magnitude-redshift relation at the range of
redshifts spaned by the supernovae surveys, it has been proposed some years ago
a very simple test of this possible validity, provided the SNIa should be
confirmed as standard candles. Since we can hope that the redshifts of the
supernovae which will be observed in the years to come will allow such a test
to be performed, it would be interesting to find inside the SNIa community some
collaborators ready to perform the test.",2005-04-21T16:39:38Z
"Predicting Single-Temperature Fit to Multi-Component Thermal Plasma
  Spectra","Observed X-ray spectra of hot gas in clusters, groups, and individual
galaxies are commonly fit with a single-temperature thermal plasma model even
though the beam may contain emission from components with different
temperatures. Recently, Mazzotta et al. pointed out that thus derived T_spec
can be significantly different from commonly used definitions of average
temperature, such as emission- or emission measure-weighted T, and found an
analytic expression for predicting T_spec for a mixture of plasma spectra with
relatively hot temperatures (T>3 keV). In this Paper, we propose an algorithm
which can accurately predict T_spec in a much wider range of temperatures
(T>0.5 keV), and for essentially arbitrary abundance of heavy elements. This
algorithm can be applied in the deprojection analysis of objects with the
temperature and metallicity gradients, for correction of the PSF effects, for
consistent comparison of numerical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups
with the X-ray observations, and for estimating how emission from undetected
components can bias the global X-ray spectral analysis.",2005-04-05T07:16:58Z
"UVBLUE: a new high-resolution theoretical library of ultraviolet stellar
  spectra","We present an extended ultraviolet-blue (850-4700 AA) library of theoretical
stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) computed at high resolution, R=
50,000. The UVBLUE grid, as we named the library, is based on LTE calculations
carried out with ATLAS9 and SYNTHE codes developed by R. L. Kurucz and consists
of nearly 1800 entries that cover a large volume of the parameter space. It
spans a range in effective temperature from 3000 to 50,000 K, the surface
gravity ranges from log g= 0.0 to 5.0 with a step of 0.5 dex, while seven
chemical compositions are considered: [Fe/H]= -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, +0.0,
+0.3 and +0.5 dex. For its coverage across the H-R diagram, this library is the
most comprehensive one ever computed at high resolution in the short-wavelength
spectral range, and useful application can be foreseen both for the study of
single stars and in population synthesis models of galaxies and other stellar
systems.",2005-04-13T20:14:40Z
"The Nature of the Driving Mechanism in the Pulsating Hybrid PG 1159 Star
  Abell 43","We extend our previous pulsational stability analyses of PG 1159 stars by
modeling the hybrid PG 1159 type star Abell 43. We show that the standard
kappa-mechanism due to the ionization of C and O in the envelope of this H-rich
PG 1159 star is perfectly able to drive g-mode pulsations. Thus, contrary to a
recent suggestion, there is no need to invoke any new or exotic mechanism to
explain the pulsational instabilities observed in this particular star. Our
expected instability band for l = 1 modes extends in period from ~ 2604 s to ~
5529 s, which is consistent with the available photometric observations of
Abell 43. We also suggest that efforts to detect luminosity variations in its
sibling NGC 7094 be pursued.",2005-05-29T16:55:02Z
Inflationary predictions for scalar and tensor fluctuations reconsidered,"We reconsider the predictions of inflation for the spectral index of scalar
(energy density) fluctuations (n_s) and the tensor/scalar ratio (r) using a
discrete, model-independent measure of the degree of fine-tuning required to
obtain a given combination of (n_s, r). We find that, except for cases with
numerous unnecessary degrees of fine-tuning, n_s is less than 0.98, measurably
different from exact Harrison-Zel'dovich. Furthermore, if n_s \gtrsim 0.95, in
accord with current measurements, the tensor/scalar ratio satisfies r \gtrsim
10^{-2}, a range that should be detectable in proposed cosmic microwave
background polarization experiments and direct gravitational wave searches.",2005-07-19T20:10:39Z
"Cluster number counts dependence on dark energy inhomogeneities and
  coupling to dark matter","Cluster number counts can be used to test dark energy models. We investigate
dark energy candidates which are coupled to dark matter. We analyze the cluster
number counts dependence on the amount of dark matter coupled to dark energy.
Further more, we study how dark energy inhomogeneities affect cluster
abundances. It is shown that increasing the coupling reduces significantly the
cluster number counts, and that dark energy inhomogeneities increases cluster
abundances. Wiggles in cluster number counts are shown to be a specific
signature of coupled dark energy models. Future observations will possibly
detect such oscillations and discriminate among the different dark energy
models.",2005-04-23T12:34:15Z
"The Large-Scale Electrochemistry and Possible Consequences of Deep

"H-alpha Imaging of Early-type (Sa-Sab) Spiral Galaxies II. Global
  Properties","New results, based on one of the most comprehensive H-alpha imaging surveys
of nearby Sa-Sab spirals completed to date, reveals early-type spirals to be a
diverse group of galaxies that span a wide range in massive star formation
rates. While the majority of Sa-Sab galaxies in our sample are forming stars at
a modest rate, a significant fraction (~29%) exhibit star formation rates
greater than 1 M(solar/yr), rivaling the most prolifically star forming
late-type spirals. A similar diversity is apparent in the star formation
history of Sa-Sab spirals as measured by their H-alpha equivalent widths.
Consistent with our preliminary results presented in the first paper in this
series, we find giant HII regions (L(H-alpha)>10^{39}erg/s) in the disks of 37%
of early-type spirals. We suspect that recent minor mergers or past
interactions are responsible for the elevated levels of H-alpha emission and
perhaps, for the presence of giant HII regions in these galaxies.",2005-06-02T20:55:41Z
"A radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude structures: I.
  Kinematics of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy","As part of a radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude structures that
we undertook with the 2dF spectrograph on the AAT, we present the radial
velocities of more than 1500 Red Giant Branch and Red Clump stars towards the
centre of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy. With a mean velocity of 72\pm7 km/s at
a Heliocentric distance of 5.5 kpc and 114\pm2 km/s at 8.5 kpc, these stars
present a peculiar distance -- radial velocity relation that is unlike that
expected from thin or thick disc stars. Moreover, they belong to a
kinematically cold population with an intrinsic dispersion that may be as low
as 11_{-1}^{+3} km/s. The radial velocity distribution is used to select Canis
Major stars in the UCAC2.0 proper motion catalogue and derive proper motions in
Galactic coordinates of (\mu_l,\mu_b)= (-3.6\pm0.8 mas/yr, 1.5\pm0.4 mas/yr)
for the dwarf galaxy, which after correcting for the reflex solar motion along
this line-of-sight gives (\mu_l',\mu_b')= (-6.8\pm0.8 mas/yr, 0.8\pm0.4
mas/yr)$, corresponding to a prograde orbit with a tangential velocity of
\sim235 km/s at the average distance of \sim7.2 kpc. All these kinematic
constraints can be reproduced in simulations of the accretion of a dwarf onto
the Galactic disc. Such a process could also be responsible for the Monoceros
Ring that has recently been shown to encompass the Galactic disc. However,
without constraints on the kinematics of the tidal arms emerging from the Canis
Major dwarf, it is not yet possible to definitively prove a link between the
two structures.",2005-03-31T16:08:14Z
"The Stochastic Effect of Ly-alpha absorbers on Broadband Luminosities of
  Galaxies","We investigate the variations of broadband luminosities of low and
intermediate redshift galaxies due to the stochastic nature of the neutral
hydrogen present in form of Ly-alpha absorbers in the intergalactic medium.
This effect is caused by variations in the distribution and properties
(redshift, column density, Doppler parameter) of the absorbers along different
lines-of-sight out to a given redshift. Using a set of observationally
constrained redshift-, column density- and Doppler parameter distributions we
perform Monte Carlo simulations for a large number of lines-of-sight towards
galaxies at a given redshift z and calculate attenuated FUV/NUV magnitudes and
corresponding 1-, 2- and 3-sigma variations. We predict significant variations
in luminosity ranging from -0.22 to +0.48 magnitudes at the 1-sigma level for
galaxies at z=1.5 in GALEX data.",2005-04-25T16:21:00Z
"Star-formation in NGC 4038/4039 from broad- and narrow band photometry:
  Cluster Destruction?","Accurately determining the star formation history in NGC 4038/4039 -- ``The
Antennae'' is hampered by extinction. We therefore used near infrared images
obtained with ISAAC at the VLT and with SOFI at the NTT to determine the recent
star formation history in this merger. In combination with archival HST data,
we determined ages, extinction and other parameters for single star clusters,
and properties of the cluster population as a whole. About 70% of the K_s-band
detected star clusters with masses >= 10^5 M_sun are younger than 10 Myrs
(approximately an e-folding time for cluster ages), which we interpret as
evidence for rapid dissolution but not free expansion. The total mass of K-band
selected clusters is about 5-10x10^8 M_sun and represents about 3-6% of the
total molecular gas. This takes into account only the detected clusters and in
view of the rapid dissolution means that this is only a lower limit to the
total mass of stars produced in clusters during the burst. Studies of cluster
formation in other galaxies recently suggested short cluster dissolution
timescales, too, which means that star formation rates may have been severely
underestimated in the past. Extinction is strongly variable and very high in
some regions, but around A_V=1.3 mag on average. Even though most clusters are
detected at least in I-band, only the information about individual cluster ages
and extinction allows to avoid uncertainties of orders of magnitude in star
formation rate estimates determined from optical fluxes. From the distribution
of individual cluster extinction vs. age, which is significantly higher for
clusters below 8-9 Myr than for older clusters, we infer that this is the time
by which a typical cluster blows free of its native dust cocoon.",2005-05-20T16:04:12Z
Exploring the Hard X-/soft gamma-ray Continuum Spectra with Laue Lenses,"The history of X-ray astronomy has shown that any advancement in our
knowledge of the X-ray sky is strictly related to an increase in instrument
sensitivity. At energies above 60 keV, there are interesting prospects for
greatly improving the limiting sensitivity of the current generation of direct
viewing telescopes (with or without coded masks), offered by the use of Laue
lenses. We will discuss below the development status of a Hard X-Ray focusing
Telescope (HAXTEL) based on Laue lenses with a broad bandpass (from 60 to 600
keV) for the study of the X-ray continuum of celestial sources. We show two
examplesof multi-lens configurations with expected sensitivity orders of
magnitude better ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-8}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$
at 200 keV) than that achieved so far. With this unprecedented sensitivity,
very exciting astrophysical prospects are opened.",2005-07-07T15:44:57Z
Effects of line-blocking on the non-LTE Fe I spectral line formation,"The effects of background line opacity (line-blocking) in statistical
equilibrium calculations for Fe in late-type stellar atmospheres have been
investigated using an extensive and up-to-date model atom with radiative data
primarily from the IRON Project. The background metal line opacities have been
computed using data from the MARCS stellar model atmospheres.
  While accounting for this line opacity is important at solar metallicity, the
differences between calculations including and excluding line-blocking at low
metallicity are insignificant for the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
(non-LTE) abundance corrections for Fe I lines. The line-blocking has no impact
on the non-LTE effects of Fe II lines. The dominant uncertainty in Fe non-LTE
calculations for metal-poor stars is still the treatment of the inelastic H I
collisions, which have here been included using scaling factors to the
classical Drawin formalism, and whether or not thermalisation of the high Fe I
levels to Fe II ground state should be enforced. Without such thermalisation,
the Fe I non-LTE abundance corrections are substantial in metal-poor stars:
about 0.3 dex with efficient (i.e. Drawin-like) H I collisions and about 0.5
dex without. Without both thermalisation and H I collisions, even Fe II lines
show significant non-LTE effects in such stars.",2005-07-15T14:59:35Z
"Non-Gaussianity of Large-Scale Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies
  beyond Perturbation Theory","We compute the fully non-linear Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropies on scales larger than the horizon at last-scattering in terms of
only the curvature perturbation, providing a generalization of the linear
Sachs-Wolfe effect at any order in perturbation theory. We show how to compute
the n-point connected correlation functions of the large-scale CMB anisotropies
for generic primordial seeds provided by standard slow-roll inflation as well
as the curvaton and other scenarios for the generation of cosmological
perturbations. As an application of our formalism, we compute the three- and
four-point connected correlation functions whose detection in future CMB
experiments might be used to assess the level of primordial non-Gaussianity,
giving the theoretical predictions for the parameters of quadratic and cubic
non-linearities f_NL and g_NL.",2005-06-17T12:57:58Z
"Discovery of multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources in the galaxy KUG
  0214-057","We report the serendipitous discovery of several unresolved X-ray sources
lying in the prominent spiral arms of the galaxy KUG 0214-057 in XMM-Newton
observations. The location of these X-ray sources strongly suggests that at
least three, and possibly four, of these may be physically related to the
galaxy. The luminosity of each of these sources at the distance of KUG 0214-057
is > 5 x 10^39 erg/s (0.3-10 keV), making each a strong candidate ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX). Using the ULXs as a metric implies that this relatively
low-mass galaxy may be experiencing rather intense starburst activity. The
serendipitous discovery of these ULXs suggests that such objects are not a
negligible component of the overall extragalactic X-ray source population.",2005-04-15T16:39:07Z
Can Life develop in the expanded habitable zones around Red Giant Stars?,"We present some new ideas about the possibility of life developing around
sub-giant and red giant stars. Our study concerns the temporal evolution of the
habitable zone. The distance between the star and the habitable zone, as well
as its width, increases with time as a consequence of stellar evolution. The
habitable zone moves outward after the star leaves the main sequence, sweeping
a wider range of distances from the star until the star reaches the tip of the
asymptotic giant branch. If life could form and evolve over time intervals from
$5 \times 10^8$ to $10^9$ years, then there could be habitable planets with
life around red giant stars. For a 1 M$_{\odot}$ star at the first stages of
its post main-sequence evolution, the temporal transit of the habitable zone is
estimated to be of several 10$^9$ years at 2 AU and around 10$^8$ years at 9
AU. Under these circumstances life could develop at distances in the range 2-9
AU in the environment of sub-giant or giant stars and in the far distant future
in the environment of our own Solar System. After a star completes its first
ascent along the Red Giant Branch and the He flash takes place, there is an
additional stable period of quiescent He core burning during which there is
another opportunity for life to develop. For a 1 M$_{\odot}$ star there is an
additional $10^9$ years with a stable habitable zone in the region from 7 to 22
AU. Space astronomy missions, such as proposed for the Terrestrial Planet
Finder (TPF) and Darwin should also consider the environments of sub-giants and
red giant stars as potentially interesting sites for understanding the
development of life.",2005-03-23T22:46:20Z
Upper Limits on a Stochastic Background of Gravitational Waves,"The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) has performed
a third science run with much improved sensitivities of all three
interferometers. We present an analysis of approximately 200 hours of data
acquired during this run, used to search for a stochastic background of
gravitational radiation. We place upper bounds on the energy density stored as
gravitational radiation for three different spectral power laws. For the flat
spectrum, our limit of Omega_0<8.4e-4 in the 69-156 Hz band is ~10^5 times
lower than the previous result in this frequency range.",2005-07-11T13:53:52Z
Observing Near Earth Asteroids with a Small Telescope,"Even from a light polluted city it is possible to observe Near Earth
Asteroids (NEAs) at opposition using a small telescope equipped with a CCD
camera. In this paper, we will overview first the major NEA programs,
continuing with planning the observations and the data reduction. Second, we
will present a NEA follow-up program carried out on the 60-cm telescope at York
University Observatory in Toronto, Canada. Part of this program, five NEAs have
been observed during ten nights. Their astrometric and photometric data were
reduced and sent to the Minor Planet Centre, following which an observatory
code was assigned and four batches have been included in the NEODyS database
and MPC Circulars. The results are applicable to any other small facility.",2005-04-11T02:56:29Z
On Precision Measurement of the Mean Curvature,"Very small mean curvature is a robust prediction of inflation worth rigorous
checking. Since current constraints are derived from determinations of the
angular-diameter distance to the CMB last-scattering surface, which is also
affected by dark energy, they are limited by our understanding of the dark
energy. Measurements of luminosity or angular-diameter distances to redshifts
in the matter-dominated era can greatly reduce this uncertainty. With a one
percent measurement of the distance to z=3, combined with the CMB data expected
from Planck, one can achieve sigma(\Omega_k h^2) \sim 10^{-3}. A non-zero
detection at this level would be evidence against inflation or for unusually
large curvature fluctuations on super-Hubble scales.",2005-03-18T00:55:03Z
"X-ray variability of NGC 3227 and NGC 5506 and the nature of AGN
  `states'","We use X-ray monitoring data obtained over a broad range of time-scales to
measure the broadband power spectral density functions (PSDs) of two Seyfert
galaxies, the broad line Seyfert 1 NGC 3227 and the Seyfert 2 NGC 5506, which
has recently been identified as an obscured Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS 1).
Using a Monte-Carlo fitting technique we demonstrate that both PSDs are
reminiscent of the PSD of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in the high/soft
state, and specifically rule out a low/hard state PSD shape in NGC 3227. This
result demonstrates that, at least where variability is concerned, broad line
Seyferts with hard X-ray spectra (photon index~1.6) are not simply the
analogues of the low/hard state in BHXRBs, and the dichotomy of NLS 1 and broad
line Seyferts cannot be simply interpreted in terms of the two states. We show
that the PSD normalisation in NGC 3227 is strongly energy dependent, with
larger variability amplitudes at lower energies, unlike NGC 5506 which shows
little energy-dependence of variability. We demonstrate that this difference is
caused by spectral pivoting of the continuum in NGC 3227 at high energies,
which is probably also related to the large amplitude of variability seen in
the 2-10 keV band in this AGN. Using the new PSD data and new results in the
literature, we replot the PSD break time-scale versus mass plot for all AGN
with PSD breaks measured so far, and demonstrate that higher accretion-rate AGN
appear to have relatively shorter break time-scales for their black hole mass
than lower-accretion rate AGN.",2005-08-02T00:07:17Z
Variation in the Scattering Shroud Surrounding Markarian 231,"We present a detailed study of the nuclear structure of the highly polarized
broad absorption line quasar, Mrk 231, through a multiwavelength campaign of
Chandra observations, optical spectroscopy, optical spectropolarimetry, and
imaging polarimetry. This campaign was designed to extend the 40 ks Chandra
study of Gallagher et al. and the optical and UV spectropolarimetric study of
Smith et al. to probe variability on multiple time scales. As direct emission
from the nucleus is heavily obscured at optical through X-ray wavelengths, the
detailed study of scattered emission has lead to insights into the stratified
and complex central region of this active galaxy. Though significant continuum
variability is not detected in any of the three new 40 ks Chandra observations,
we investigate FeKalpha emission features in the individual and combined
spectra. Comparing echelle spectra of the NaI D absorption lines with the
literature, we show that one system disappeared in 2000 only to reappear in
later epochs. Notably, we detect a large decrease in polarization across the
entire optical spectrum of Mrk 231 from 1995 to 2003. Though the polarization
fraction fell, e.g., from 4% to 3% at about 6000 Angstroms, the polarization
position angle spectrum remained unchanged. The optical polarization behavior
is consistent with a decrease in the flux scattered by circumnuclear material
on spatial scales where the broad-line region is resolved by the scattering
material. Ultraviolet imaging polarimetry of Mrk 231 by HST sets an upper limit
on the distance between the active nucleus and the scattering regions of <20
pc.",2005-06-25T00:43:12Z
ISO's Contribution to the Study of Clusters of Galaxies,"Starting with nearby galaxy clusters like Virgo and Coma, and continuing out
to the furthest galaxy clusters for which ISO results have yet been published
($z=0.56$), we discuss the development of knowledge of the infrared and
associated physical properties of galaxy clusters from early IRAS observations,
through the ""ISO-era"" to the present, in order to explore the status of ISO's
contribution to this field. Relevant IRAS and ISO programmes are reviewed,
addressing both the cluster galaxies and the still-very-limited evidence for an
infrared-emitting intra-cluster medium. ISO made important advances in
knowledge of both nearby and distant galaxy clusters, such as the discovery of
a major cold dust component in Virgo and Coma cluster galaxies, the elaboration
of the correlation between dust emission and Hubble-type, and the detection of
numerous Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) in several distant clusters. These
and consequent achievements are underlined and described. We recall that, due
to observing time constraints, ISO's coverage of higher-redshift galaxy
clusters to the depths required to detect and study statistically significant
samples of cluster galaxies over a range of morphological types could not be
comprehensive and systematic, and such systematic coverage of distant clusters
will be an important achievement of the Spitzer Observatory.",2005-06-17T19:20:27Z
"Total Galaxy Magnitudes and Effective Radii from Petrosian Magnitudes
  and Radii","Petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task of
determining a galaxy's total light. Although these magnitudes (taken here as
the flux within 2R_P, with the inverted Petrosian index 1/eta(R_P)=0.2) can
represent most of an object's flux, they do of course miss the light outside of
the Petrosian aperture (2R_P). The size of this flux deficit varies
monotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light-profile, i.e., its
concentration. In the case of a de Vaucouleurs R^{1/4} profile, the deficit is
0.20 mag; for an R^{1/8} profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. Here we provide
a simple method for recovering total (Sersic) magnitudes from Petrosian
magnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (R_90/R_50 or R_80/R_20) within
the Petrosian aperture. The corrections hold to the extent that Sersic's model
provides a good description of a galaxy's luminosity profile. We show how the
concentration can also be used to convert Petrosian radii into effective
half-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surface
brightness. Our technique is applied to the SDSS DR2 Petrosian parameters,
yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and mean
effective surface brightnesses obtained from the NYU--VAGC Sersic R^{1/n} fits
by Blanton et al. (2005). Although the corrective procedure described here is
specifically applicable to the SDSS DR2 and DR3, it is generally applicable to
all imaging data where any Petrosian index and concentration can be
constructed.",2005-04-13T05:28:07Z
Unusual high-redshift radio BAL quasar 1624+3758,"We present observations of the most radio-luminous BAL quasar known,
1624+3758, at redshift z = 3.377. The quasar has several unusual properties:
(1) The FeII UV191 1787-A emission line is very prominent. (2) The BAL trough
(BALnicity index 2990 km/s) is detached by 21000 km/s and extends to velocity v
= -29000 km/s. There are additional intrinsic absorbers at -1900 and -2800
km/s. (3) The radio rotation measure of the quasar, 18350 rad/m^2, is the
second-highest known.
  The radio luminosity is P(1.4GHz) = 4.3 x 10^27 W/Hz (H0 = 50 km/s/Mpc, q0 =
0.5), radio loudness R* = 260. The radio source is compact (<~ 2.8 kpc) and the
radio spectrum is GHz-peaked, consistent with it being relatively young. The
width of the CIV emission line, in conjunction with the total optical
luminosity, implies black-hole mass ~ 10^9 M(sun), L/L(Eddington) ~ 2. The high
Eddington ratio, and the radio-loudness, place this quasar in one corner of
Boroson's (2002) 2-component scheme for the classification of AGN, implying a
very high accretion rate, and this may account for some of the unusual observed
properties.
  A complex mini-BAL absorber at v = -3000 km/s is detected in each of CIV, NV
and OVI. The blue and red components of the CIV doublet happen to be unblended,
allowing both the covering factor and optical depth to be determined as a
function of velocity. Variation of covering factor with velocity dominates the
form of the mini-BAL...",2005-04-22T15:29:33Z
Convective Dynamos and the Minimum X-ray Flux in Main Sequence Stars,"The objective of this paper is to investigate whether a convective dynamo can
account quantitatively for the observed lower limit of X-ray surface flux in
solar-type main sequence stars. Our approach is to use 3D numerical simulations
of a turbulent dynamo driven by convection to characterize the dynamic
behavior, magnetic field strengths, and filling factors in a non-rotating
stratified medium, and to predict these magnetic properties at the surface of
cool stars. We use simple applications of stellar structure theory for the
convective envelopes of main-sequence stars to scale our simulations to the
outer layers of stars in the F0--M0 spectral range, which allows us to estimate
the unsigned magnetic flux on the surface of non-rotating reference stars. With
these estimates we use the recent results of \citet{Pevtsov03} to predict the
level of X-ray emission from such a turbulent dynamo, and find that our results
compare well with observed lower limits of surface X-ray flux. If we scale our
predicted X-ray fluxes to \ion{Mg}{2} fluxes we also find good agreement with
the observed lower limit of chromospheric emission in K dwarfs. This suggests
that dynamo action from a convecting, non-rotating plasma is a viable
alternative to acoustic heating models as an explanation for the basal emission
level seen in chromospheric, transition region, and coronal diagnostics from
late-type stars.",2005-06-01T18:49:08Z
"Cluster number counts dependence on dark energy inhomogeneities and
  coupling to dark matter","Cluster number counts can be used to test dark energy models. We investigate
dark energy candidates which are coupled to dark matter. We analyze the cluster
number counts dependence on the amount of dark matter coupled to dark energy.
Further more, we study how dark energy inhomogeneities affect cluster
abundances. It is shown that increasing the coupling reduces significantly the
cluster number counts, and that dark energy inhomogeneities increases cluster
abundances. Wiggles in cluster number counts are shown to be a specific
signature of coupled dark energy models. Future observations will possibly
detect such oscillations and discriminate among the different dark energy
models.",2005-04-23T12:34:15Z
"Towards Planetesimals in the Disk around TW Hya: 3.5 centimeter Dust
  Emission","We present Very Large Array observations at 3.5 cm of the nearby young star
TW Hya that show the emission is constant in time over weeks, months and years,
and spatially resolved with peak brightness temperature ~10 K at ~0.25 (15 AU)
resolution. These features are naturally explained if the emission mechanism at
this wavelength is thermal emission from dust particles in the disk surrounding
the star. To account quantitatively for the observations, we construct a
self-consistent accretion disk model that incorporates a population of
centimeter size particles that matches the long wavelength spectrum and spatial
distribution. A substantial mass fraction of orbiting particles in the TW Hya
disk must have agglomerated to centimeter size. These data provide the first
clear indication that dust emission from protoplanetary disks may be observed
at centimeter wavelengths, and that changes in the spectral slope of the dust
emission may be detected, providing constraints on dust evolution and the
planet formation process.",2005-06-27T13:59:47Z
OI Line Emission in the Quasar PG 1116+215,"By observing the near-infrared spectrum of the quasar PG 1116+215 at z =
0.176 and combining with the HST/FOS spectrum, we obtained the relative
strengths of three permitted OI lines ({lambda}1304, {lambda}8446, and
{lambda}11287) in a quasar for the first time. The photon flux ratios of the OI
lines of the quasar were compared with those previously measured in a Seyfert 1
and six narrow-line Seyfert 1s. No significant differences were found in the OI
line flux ratios between the quasar and the other Seyferts, suggesting that the
gas density in the OI and FeII line-emitting regions in the quasar is of the
same order as those in low-luminosity AGNs. It was also found that the line
width of OI {lambda}11287 is significantly narrower than that of Ly{alpha},
which is consistent with OI and FeII emission occurring in the partly ionized
regions at the outermost portion of the broad-line region where velocities are
small.",2005-05-29T05:04:49Z
Line profiles of molecular ions toward the pre-stellar core LDN 1544,"Velocity profiles of ground state lines of H2D+, HC18O+ and N2H+, observed
previously with the CSO and IRAM 30m telescopes, are modeled with a Monte Carlo
radiative transfer program to study the temperature, density and velocity
structure of the pre-stellar core LDN 1544. The H2D+ line is double-peaked like
that of the other ions, but previous models that fit the HC18O+ and N2H+
profiles are found not to fit the H2D+ data. Matching the H2D+ observations
requires at least three modifications to the model at small radii: (1) the
density profile must continue to rise inward and not flatten off toward the
center; (2) the gas temperature must be nearly constant and not drop inwards
significantly; (3) the infall velocity must increase inward, in a fashion
intermediate between `quasi-static' (ambipolar diffusion) and `fully dynamic'
(Larson-Penston) collapse. The C18O emission indicates a chemical age of <~0.1
Myr. The effects of a flattened structure and rotation on the line profiles are
shown to be unimportant, at least on the scales probed by single-dish
telescopes. Alternatively, the H2D+ profile is affected by absorption in the
outer layers of the core, if gas motions in these layers are sufficiently
small.",2005-05-04T13:45:58Z
Mass Estimates for Some of the Binary Lenses in OGLE III Database,"We model binary microlensing events OGLE 2003-BLG-170, 267, and 291. Source
angular sizes are measured for the events 267 and 291. Model fits to the light
curves give parallaxes for the events 267 and 291, and relative source sizes
for 170 and 267. Selfconsistency arguments provide extra limits on the models
of the event 291. As a result we obtain likelihood estimate of the lens mass
for the event 170, mass measurement based on angular size and parallax for 267,
and narrow limits on mass in the case of 291. Brown dwarfs are most likely
candidates for some of the lens components. The influence of the binary lens
rotation and the Earth parallax may be important but hard to distinguish when
modeling relatively short lasting binary lens events.",2005-07-15T13:52:35Z
Rotation and anisotropy of galaxies revisited,"The use of the tensor virial theorem (TVT) as a diagnostic of anisotropic
velocity distributions in galaxies is revisited. The TVT provides a rigorous
global link between velocity anisotropy, rotation and shape, but the quantities
appearing in it are not easily estimated observationally. Traditionally use has
been made of a centrally averaged velocity dispersion and the peak rotation
velocity. Although this procedure cannot be rigorously justified, tests on
model galaxies show that it works surprisingly well. With the advent of
integral-field spectroscopy it is now possible to establish a rigorous
connection between the TVT and observations. The TVT is reformulated in terms
of sky-averages, and the new formulation is tested on model galaxies.",2005-04-18T13:22:16Z
"Accretion by the Secondary in Eta Carinae During the Spectroscopic
  Event: I. Flow Parameters","We examine the influence of the gravity of the companion (the secondary) to
the massive primary star Eta Carinae on the winds blown by the primary and the
secondary. The two winds collide with each other after passing through two
respective shock waves, and escape the system while strongly emitting in the
X-ray band. While during most of the 5.5 years orbital period, the companion's
gravity has a negligible effect on the winds, we find that near periastron, the
companion's gravity may significantly influence the flow and the companion
might accrete from the primary's wind under certain circumstances. Near
periastron passage, the collision region of the two winds may collapse onto the
secondary star, a process that could substantially reduce the X-ray luminosity.
We suggest that such an accretion process produces the long, almost flat, X-ray
minimum in Eta Carinae.",2005-05-11T03:37:47Z
"Non-thermal Cosmic Backgrounds from Blazars: the contribution to the
  CMB, X-ray and gamma-ray Backgrounds","We present a new assessment of the contribution of Blazars to the
extragalactic background radiation across the e.m. spectrum. Our calculations
rely on deep Blazar radio counts that we derived combining several
multifrequency surveys. The integrated Blazar emission yields a broad-band
non-thermal background that in some parts of the e.m. spectrum dominates the
extragalactic brightness. Blazars are the main point-like contributors to the
CMB. Their integrated emission causes an apparent T increase of 5-50 muK in the
50-250 GHz range. The CMB fluctuation spectrum is sensibly contaminated at
l>300, for a Poissonian source distribution, or at lower l values if spatial
clustering is present. We estimate that well over 100,000 Blazars will produce
a significant signal in the PLANCK CMB anisotropy maps. Because of the
microwave-Xray flux correlation, these sources are expected to have flux > a
few 10^{-15} erg/s in the soft X-ray band. Thus, a large fraction of the
foreground sources in CMB anisotropy maps could be identified and removed using
a multi frequency approach, provided that a sufficiently deep all sky X-ray
survey will be available. We further show that Blazars are a major constituent
of all high-E extragalactic backgrounds. Their contribution is 11-12% at X-ray
frequencies and possibly 100% in the 0.5-50 MeV band. At E>100 MeV, the Blazar
collective emission, obtained extrapolating their integrated micro-wave flux to
the gamma-ray band using the SED of EGRET detected sources, over-predicts the
extragalactic background by a large factor, implying that Blazars not only
dominate the gamma-ray sky but also that their average duty cycle at these
frequencies must be rather low. We also find that Blazars of the HBL type may
produce a significant amount of flux at TeV energies.",2005-08-01T10:48:48Z
Recent Searches for the Radio Lines of NH_3 in Comets,"Radio observations in the ammonia inversion lines of four comets, C/2001 A2
(LINEAR), 153P/Ikeya-Zhang, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) and C/2002 T7 (LINEAR), were
performed at the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope during their respective close
approaches to Earth. None of the four lowest energy metastable lines
(J,K=J),J=1--4, could be detected in these comets. We derive the following 3
sigma upper bounds on the NH_3 production rate, and c omparing to the
corresponding water production rates, percentage NH_3 abundances relative to
H_2O:
  Q(NH_3) < 1.9x10^26 s^-1 (0.63%) for C/2001 A2 (LINEAR),
  Q(NH_3) < 2.7x10^26 s^-1 (0.13%) for C/2001 Q4 (NEAT),
  Q(NH_3) < 2.3x10^27 s^-1 (0.74%) for C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) and Q(NH_3) <=
6.3x10^26 s^-1 (0.63%) for Comet 153P/Ikeya-Zhang.
  At 0.74% or less, the ammonia-to-water ratios are factors of 2 below the
value for C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) and 1P/Halley, suggesting chemical diversity
between comets. The 18-cm lines of OH were clearly detected in the two comets
observed during the 2004 campaign, thereby validating the cometary ephemerides.",2005-05-20T13:47:08Z
An Infrared Coronagraphic Survey for Substellar Companions,"We have used the F160W filter (1.4-1.8 um) and the coronagraph on the
Near-InfraRed Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) on the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) to survey 45 single stars with a median age of 0.15 Gyr, an
average distance of 30 pc, and an average H-magnitude of 7 mag. For the median
age we were capable of detecting a 30 M_Jup companion at separations between 15
and 200 AU. A 5 M_Jup object could have been detected at 30 AU around 36% of
our primaries. For several of our targets that were less than 30 Myr old, the
lower mass limit was as low as a Jupiter mass, well into the high mass planet
region. Results of the entire survey include the proper motion verification of
five low-mass stellar companions, two brown dwarfs (HR7329B and TWA5B) and one
possible brown dwarf binary (Gl 577B/C).",2005-06-15T22:32:01Z
An 850 micron survey for dust around solar mass stars,"We present the results of an 850 micron JCMT/SCUBA survey for dust around 13
nearby solar mass stars. The dust mass sensitivity ranged from 0.005 to 0.16
Earth masses. Three sources were detected in the survey, one of which (HD
107146) has been previously reported. One of the other two submillimeter
sources, HD 104860, was not detected by IRAS and is surrounded by a cold,
massive dust disk with a dust temperature and mass of Tdust = 33 K and Mdust =
0.16 Mearth. The third source, HD 8907, was detected by IRAS and ISO at 60-87
microns, and has a dust temperature and mass Tdust = 48 K and Mdust = 0.036
Mearth. We find that the deduced masses and radii of the dust disks in our
sample are roughly consistent with models for the collisional evolution of
planetesimal disks with embedded planets. We also searched for residual gas in
two of the three systems with detected submillimeter excesses and place limits
on the mass of gas residing in these systems.
  When the properties measured for the detected excess sources are combined
with the larger population of submillimeter excess sources from the literature,
we find strong evidence that the mass in small grains declines significantly on
a ~200 Myr timescale, approximately inversely with age. However, we also find
that the characteristic dust radii of the population, obtained from the dust
temperature of the excess and assuming blackbody grains, is uncorrelated with
age. This is in contrast to self-stirred collisional models for debris disk
evolution which predict a trend of radius increasing with age, t ~ R^3. The
lack of agreement suggests that processes beyond self-stirring, such as giant
planet formation, play a role in the evolutionary histories of planetesimal
disks.",2005-08-05T19:39:25Z
"Extinction law variations and dust excitation in the spiral galaxy NGC
  300","We investigate the origin of the strong radial gradient in the
ultraviolet-to-infrared ratio in the spiral galaxy NGC 300, and emphasize the
importance of local variations in the interstellar medium geometry, concluding
that they cannot be neglected with respect to metallicity effects. This
analysis is based upon a combination of maps from GALEX and Spitzer, and from
the ground (UBVRI, Halpha and Hbeta). We select ionizing stellar clusters
associated with HII regions of widely varying morphologies, and derive their
fundamental parameters from population synthesis fitting of their spectral
energy distributions, measured to eliminate local backgrounds accurately. From
these fits, we conclude that the stellar extinction law is highly variable in
the line of sight of young clusters of similar ages. In the particular model
geometry that we consider most appropriate to the sampled regions, we checked
that our findings are not significantly altered by the correct treatment of
radiative transfer effects. The variations are systematic in nature: extinction
laws of the Milky Way or LMC type are associated with compact HII regions (the
compacity being quantified in two different ways), while clusters surrounded by
diffuse HII regions follow extinction laws of the 30 Doradus or SMC type. The
Calzetti starburst attenuation law, although most often degenerate with the 30
Doradus extinction law, overpredicts ionizing photon fluxes by large amounts.
We also find that the extinction law variations are correlated with the column
density of dust species emitting in the near- and mid-infrared. Finally, we
briefly discuss the nebular to stellar extinction ratios, and the excitation of
aromatic band carriers, invalidating their claimed association with cold dust.",2005-06-15T03:30:23Z
"Heteroclinic orbit and tracking attractor in cosmological model with a
  double exponential potential","In this paper, the dynamical heteroclinic orbit and attractor have been
employed to make the late-time behaviors of the model insensitive to the
initial condition and thus alleviates the fine tuning problem in cosmological
dynamical system of barotropic fluid and quintessence with a double exponential
potential. The late-time asymptotic behavior of the double exponential model
does not always correspond to the single case. The heteroclinic orbits are the
non-stationary solutions and in general they will interpolate between the
critical points. Although they can not be shown analytically, yet a numerical
calculation can reveal most of their properties. Varied heteroclinic orbits and
attractors including tracking attractor and de Sitter attractor have been
found.",2005-08-01T02:48:14Z
"The Connection Between Galaxies and Intergalactic Absorption Lines at
  Redshift 2<z<3","Absorption-line spectroscopy of 23 background QSOs and numerous background
galaxies has let us measure the spatial distribution of metals and neutral
hydrogen around 1044 UV-selected galaxies at redshifts 1.8<z<3.3. The typical
galaxy is surrounded to radii r~40 proper kpc by gas that has a large velocity
spread (dv>260 km/s) and produces very strong absorption lines (N_CIV >> 10^14
cm^-2) in the spectra of background objects. Absorption with an average column
density of N_CIV ~ 10^14 cm^-2 extends to 80 kpc, a radius large enough to
imply that most strong intergalactic CIV absorption is associated with
star-forming galaxies like those in our sample. We find that the galaxy-CIV
cross-correlation length increases with CIV column density and is similar to
the galaxy-galaxy length (r_0 ~ 4 h^-1 Mpc) for N_CIV > 10^12.5 cm^-2.
Distortions in the redshift-space galaxy-CIV correlation function on small
scales may imply that some of the CIV systems have large peculiar velocities.
Four of the five detected OVI absorption systems in our sample lie within 400
proper kpc of a known galaxy. Strong Lyman-a absorption is produced by the
intergalactic gas within 1 h^-1 comoving Mpc of most galaxies, but for a
significant minority (~1/3) the absorption is weak or absent. We were unable to
identify any statistically significant differences between galaxies with weak
nearby HI absorption and the rest, although galaxies with weak absorption may
have higher star-formation rates. Galaxies near intergalactic CIV systems
appear to reside in relatively dense environments and to have distinctive
spectral energy distributions that are characterized by blue colors and young
ages. (abridged)",2005-05-06T11:08:06Z
"The dynamical fingerprint of intermediate mass black holes in globular
  clusters","A number of observations hints for the presence of an intermediate mass black
hole (IMBH) in the core of three globular clusters: M15 and NGC 6752 in the
Milky Way, and G1, in M31. However the existence of these IMBHs is far form
being conclusive. In this paper, we review their main formation channels and
explore possible observational signs that a single or binary IMBH can imprint
on cluster stars. In particular we explore the role played by a binary IMBH in
transferring angular momentum and energy to stars flying by.",2005-04-08T10:32:07Z
"Black hole X-ray binaries LMC X-1 and X-3: observations confront
  spectral models","We present a comprehensive spectral analysis of black hole X-ray binaries,
LMC X-1 and LMC X-3, based on BeppoSAX observations. We test both the
multi-color disk plus power law (MCD+PL) model and a newly-developed
Monte-Carlo simulation- based model for a Comptonized MCD (CMCD) with either a
spherical or a slab-like corona, by comparing the inferred parameters with
independent direct measurements. While all models give an adequate description
of the spectra, we find a significant discrepancy between the MCD+PL inferred
X-ray-absorbing gas column density and the absorption-edge measurement based on
dispersed X-ray spectra. The MCD+PL fits to the LMC X-1 spectra also require a
change in the inner disk radius during the BeppoSAX observation, which may be
due to the nonphysical effects inherited in the model. In contrast, the CMCD
model with the spheric corona gives the predictions of both the disk
inclination angle and the absorption that are consistent with the direct
measurements, and only slightly under-predicts the black hole mass of LMC X-3.
The model explains the spectral state evolution of LMC X-1 within the BeppoSAX
observation as a change in the accretion rate, which leads to an increase in
both the inner disk temperature and the Comptonization opacity. On the other
hand, the CMCD model with the slab-like corona is more problematic in the test
and is thus not recommended.",2005-08-02T20:16:17Z
"SN/GRB connection: a statistical approach with BATSE and Asiago
  Catalogues","Recent observations suggest that some types of GRB are physically connected
with SNe of type Ib/c. However, it has been pointed out by several authors that
some GRBs could be associated also with other types of core-collapse SNe (type
IIdw/IIn). On the basis of a comphrensive statistical study, which has made use
of the BATSE and Asiago catalogues, we have found that: i) the temporal and
spacial distribution of SNe-Ib/c is marginally correlated with that of the
BATSE GRBs; ii) we do not confirm the existence of an association between GRBs
and SNe-IIdw/IIn.",2005-05-03T11:39:15Z
"CAIRNS: The Cluster And Infall Region Nearby Survey III. Environmental
  Dependence of H-alpha Properties of Galaxies","We investigate the environmental dependence of star formation in cluster
virial regions and infall regions as part of CAIRNS (Cluster And Infall Region
Nearby Survey), a large spectroscopic survey of the infall regions surrounding
nine nearby rich clusters of galaxies. Our long-slit spectroscopy yields
estimates of star formation rates in environments from cluster cores to the
general large-scale structure. The fraction of galaxies with current star
formation in their inner disks as traced by H-alpha emission increases with
distance from the cluster and converges to the ``field'' value only at 2-3
virial radii, in agreement with other investigations. However, among galaxies
with significant current star formation (EW[Ha]geq2\AA), there is no difference
in the distribution of EW[Ha] inside and outside the virial radius. This
surprising result, first seen by Carter et al., suggests that (1) star
formation is truncated on either very short timescales or only at moderate and
high redshifts or (2) that projection effects contaminate the measurement. The
number density profiles of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies indicate
that, among galaxies projected inside the virial radius, at least half of the
former and 20% of the latter are ``infall interlopers,'' galaxies in the infall
region but outside the virial region. The kinematics of star-forming galaxies
in the infall region closely match those of absorption-dominated galaxies. This
result shows that the star forming galaxies in the infall regions are not
interlopers from the field and excludes one model of the backsplash scenario of
galaxy transformation. Finally, we quantify systematic uncertainties in
estimating the global star formation in galaxies from their inner disks.",2005-06-27T20:00:04Z
Cosmological constraints on a classical limit of quantum gravity,"We investigate the cosmology of a recently proposed deformation of Einstein
gravity, emerging from quantum gravity heuristics. The theory is constructed to
have de Sitter space as a vacuum solution, and thus to be relevant to the
accelerating universe. However, this solution turns out to be unstable, and the
true phase space of cosmological solutions is significantly more complex,
displaying two late-time power-law attractors -- one accelerating and the other
dramatically decelerating. It is also shown that non-accelerating cosmologies
sit on a separatrix between the two basins of attraction of these attractors.
Hence it is impossible to pass from a decelerating cosmology to an accelerating
one, as required in standard cosmology for consistency with nucleosynthesis and
structure formation and compatibility with the data inferred from supernovae
Ia. We point out that alternative models of the early universe, such as the one
investigated here might provide possible ways to circumvent these requirements.",2005-06-16T18:55:00Z
"Early-Time Chromatic Variations in the Wind-Swept Medium of GRB 021211
  and the Faintness of its Afterglow","We present Follow-Up Network for Gamma-Ray Bursts (FUN GRB) Collaboration
observations of the optical afterglow of GRB 021211 made between 143 seconds
and 102 days after the burst. Our unique data set includes the earliest
filtered detections and color information for an afterglow in the pre-Swift
era. We find that the afterglow is best described by (1) propagation through a
wind-swept medium, (2) a cooling break that is blueward of the observed optical
frequencies, and (3) a hard electron energy distribution. However, superimposed
on this ""standard model"" behavior we find significant chromatic variations
within the first few hours after the burst. We consider possible reasons for
these variations, including the possibility that they are due to a dust echo.
Finally, we constrain physical parameters that describe the afterglow and
surrounding medium for a variety of scenarios and find that GRB 021211's
afterglow is faint for a combination of 3-4 reasons: (1) a low fraction of
energy in relativistic electrons, (2) a low density for the wind-swept medium,
implying either a low mass-loss rate and/or a high wind velocity for the
progenitor, (3) a wide opening/viewing angle for the jet, and possibly (4)
moderate source frame extinction. The jet appears to be significantly far from
equipartition and magnetically dominated. More extreme versions of this might
explain the darkness of many afterglows in the Swift era.",2005-05-23T18:03:44Z
A dearth of planetary transits in the direction of NGC 6940,"We present results of our survey for planetary transits in the field of NGC

obtained high precision (3-10 millimags at the bright end) photometric
observations of 50,000 stars spanning 18 nights in an attempt to identify low
amplitude and short period transit events. We have used a matched filter
analysis to identify 14 stars that show multiple events, and four stars that
show single transits. Of these 18 candidates, we have identified two that
should be further researched. However, none of the candidates are convincing

"The open cluster initial-final mass relationship and the high-mass tail
  of the white dwarf distribution","Recent studies of white dwarfs in open clusters have provided new constraints
on the initial - final mass relationship (IFMR) for main sequence stars with
masses in the range 2.5 - 6.5 Mo. We re-evaluate the ensemble of data that
determines the IFMR and argue that the IFMR can be characterised by a mean
initial-final mass relationship about which there is an intrinsic scatter. We
investigate the consequences of the IFMR for the observed mass distribution of
field white dwarfs using population synthesis calculations. We show that while
a linear IFMR predicts a mass distribution that is in reasonable agreement with
the recent results from the PG survey, the data are better fitted by an IFMR
with some curvature. Our calculations indicate that a significant (~28%)
percentage of white dwarfs originating from single star evolution have masses
in excess of ~0.8 Mo, obviating the necessity for postulating the existence of
a dominant population of high-mass white dwarfs that arise from binary star
mergers.",2005-06-14T19:39:36Z
"The Shocking Properties of Supersonic Flows: Dependence of the Thermal
  Overstability on M, alpha, and T_c/T_0","We investigate the Mach number dependence of the radiative overstability of
shocks. We find that the stability of radiative shocks increases with
decreasing Mach number, with the result that M=2 shocks require cooling
exponents < -1.2 to be overstable. The frequency of oscillation of the
fundamental mode has a strong Mach number dependence. We find that feedback
between the cooling region and the cold dense layer (CDL) further downstream is
a function of Mach number, with stronger feedback and oscillation of the
boundary between the CDL and the cooling region occuring at lower Mach numbers.
This feedback can be quantified in terms of the reflection coefficient of sound
waves. An interesting finding is that the stability properties of low Mach
number shocks can be dramatically altered if the shocked gas is able to cool to
temperatures less than the pre-shock value, and it is probable that low Mach
number astrophysical shocks will be overstable in a variety of situations. The
results of this work are relevant to astrophysical shocks with low Mach
numbers, such as supernova remnants (SNRs) immersed in a hot interstellar
medium (e.g., within a starburst region), and shocks in molecular clouds, where
time-dependent chemistry can lead to overstability. (Abridged)",2005-04-28T16:34:15Z

"The theory of canonical perturbations applied to attitude dynamics and
  to the Earth rotation. Osculating and nonosculating Andoyer variables","The Hamiltonian theory of Earth rotation, known as the Kinoshita-Souchay
theory, operates with nonosculating Andoyer elements. This situation parallels
a similar phenomenon that often happens (but seldom gets noticed) in orbital
dynamics, when the standard Lagrange-type or Delaunay-type planetary equations
unexpectedly render nonosculating orbital elements. In orbital mechanics,
osculation loss happens when a velocity-dependent perturbation is plugged into
the standard planetary equations. In attitude mechanics, osculation is lost
when an angular-velocity-dependent disturbance is plugged in the standard
dynamical equations for the Andoyer elements. We encounter exactly this
situation in the theory of Earth rotation, because this theory contains an
angular-velocity-dependent perturbation (the switch from an inertial frame to
that associated with the precessing ecliptic of date).
  While the osculation loss does not influence the predictions for the figure
axis of the planet, it considerably alters the predictions for the
instantaneous spin-axis' orientation. We explore this issue in great detail.",2005-06-19T20:50:26Z
Microquasars and Jets,"I present an overview of past, present and future research on microquasars

archetype, namely GRS 1915+105, and present accretion and ejection phenomena,
showing that only a multi-wavelength approach allows a better understanding of
phenomena occuring in these sources. Thereafter, I review jets at different

Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors,"Based on a new sample of 355 quasars with significant optical polarization

polarization vectors are not randomly oriented over the sky with a probability
often in excess of 99.9%. The polarization vectors appear coherently oriented
or aligned over huge (~ 1 Gpc) regions of the sky located at both low (z ~ 0.5)
and high (z ~ 1.5) redshifts and characterized by different preferred
directions of the quasar polarization. In fact, there seems to exist a regular
alternance along the line of sight of regions of randomly and aligned
polarization vectors with a typical comoving length scale of 1.5 Gpc.
Furthermore, the mean polarization angle \bar{\theta} appears to rotate with
redshift at the rate of ~ 30\degr per Gpc. The symmetry of the the \bar{\theta}
-z relation is mirror-like, the mean polarization angle rotating clockwise with
increasing redshift in North Galactic hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the
South Galactic one. These characteristics make the alignment effect difficult
to explain in terms of local mechanisms, namely a contamination by interstellar
polarization in our Galaxy. While interpretations like a global rotation of the
Universe can potentially explain the effect, the properties we observe
qualitatively correspond to the dichroism and birefringence predicted by
photon-pseudoscalar oscillation within a magnetic field. Interestingly, the
alignment effect seems to be prominent along an axis not far from preferred
directions tentatively identified in the CMB maps. Although many questions and
more particularly the interpretation of the effect remain open, alignments of
quasar polarization vectors appear as a promising new way to probe the Universe
and its dark components at extremely large scales.",2005-07-12T08:32:15Z
A Potential Supernova Remnant/X-ray Binary Association in M31,"The well-studied X-ray/Optical/Radio supernova remnant DDB 1-15 (CXOM31
J004327.8+411829; r3-63) in M31 has been investigated with archival XMM-Newton
and Chandra observations. The timing data from XMM-Newton reveals a power
density spectrum (PDS) characteristic of accreting compact objects in X-ray
binaries (XRBs). The PDS shows features typical of Roche lobe overflow
accretion, hinting that the XRB is low-mass. The Chandra observations resolve
the SNR into a shell and show a variable count rate at the 94% confidence level
in the northwest quadrant. Together, these XMM-Newton and Chandra data suggest
that there is an XRB in the SNR r3-63 and that the XRB is located in the
northwestern portion of the SNR. The currently-available X-ray and optical data
show no evidence that the XRB is high-mass. If the XRB is low-mass, r3-63 would
be the first SNR found to contain a low-mass X-ray binary.",2005-08-08T18:01:39Z
"""PAH"" emission bands in selected planetary nebulae: a study of the
  behaviour with gas phase C/O ratio","Airborne and space-based low-resolution spectroscopy in the 1980s discovered
tantalizing quantitative relationships between the gas phase C/O abundance
ratio in planetary nebulae (PNe) and the fractions of total far-infrared
luminosity radiated by the 7.7 and 11.3 micron bands (the C=C stretch and C-H
bend, respectively), of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Only a very small
sample of nebulae was studied in this context, limited by airborne observations
of the 7.7 micron band, or the existence of adequate IRAS Low Resolution
Spectrometer data for the 11.3 micron band. To investigate these trends
further, we have expanded the sample of planetaries available for this study
using Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) low-resolution spectra secured with the
Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) and the Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS).
The new sample of 43 PNe, of which 17 are detected in PAH emission, addresses
the range from C/O=0.2-13 with the objective of trying to delineate the
pathways by which carbon dust grains might have formed in planetaries. For the
7.7-micron and 11.3- micron bands, we confirm that the ratio of band strength
to total infrared luminosity is correlated with the nebular C/O ratio.
Expressed in equivalent width terms, the cut-on C/O ratio for the 7.7-micron
band is found to be 0.6(+0.2,-0.4), in good accord with that found from
sensitive ground-based measurements of the 3.3-micron band too.",2005-07-08T16:56:17Z
"Growth of Intermediate Massive Black Holes in the Hierarchical Formation
  of Small Spiral Galaxies in the High-z Universe","Combining a theoretical model of mass accretion onto a galactic center with a
high-resolution $N$-body/SPH simulation, we investigate the formation of an
intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) during the hierarchical formation of a
small spiral galaxy (with a total mass of $10^{10}M_{\odot}$) in the high-$z$
universe. We found that the rate of average mass accretion to the nucleus due
to the radiation drag exerted by newly formed stars in the forming galaxy is
$\approx 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. As a result of this accretion, an IMBH
with $\approx 10^{4}M_{\odot}$ can be formed in the center of the spiral galaxy
at $z\sim 4$. We found that a central BH coevolves with the dark matter halo
from $z\sim 15$ to $z\sim 2$. The mass ratio of the BH to the dark matter halo
is nearly constant $\approx (1-3) \times 10^{-6}$ from $z\sim 10$ to $z\sim 2$.
This is because that change in the dark matter potential enhances star
formation in the central part of the galaxy, and as a result the BH evolves due
to mass accretion via the radiation drag. Therefore, our model naturally
predicts a correlation between massive BHs and dark matter halos. Moreover, it
is found that the final BH-to-bulge mass ratio ($\approx 5\times 10^{-5}$) in a
small spiral galaxy at high-$z$ is much smaller than that in the large galaxies
($\approx 10^{-3}$). Our results also suggest that the scatter in the observed
scaling relations between the bulge mass and black hole mass are caused by a
time lag between BH growth and growth of bulge. We also predict that the X-ray
luminosity of AGN is positively correlated with the CO luminosity in the
central region. By comparing our results with the properties of Lyman break
galaxies (LBGs), it is predicted that some LBGs have massive BHs of $\approx
10^{6}-10^{7}M_{\odot}$.",2005-04-08T14:09:45Z
"2-D Monte Carlo simulations of H I line formation in massive YSO disk
  winds","Massive young stellar objects (YSOs) are powerful infrared H I line emitters.
It has been suggested that these lines form in a outflow from a disk
surrounding the YSO. Here, new two-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer
calculations are described which test this hypothesis. Infrared spectra are
synthesised for a YSO disk wind model based on earlier hydrodynamical
calculations. The model spectra are in qualitative agreement with the observed
spectra from massive YSOs, and therefore provide support for a disk wind
explanation for the H I lines. However, there are some significant differences:
the models tend to overpredict the Br alpha/Br gamma ratio of equivalent-widths
and produce line profiles which are slightly too broad and, in contrast to
typical observations, are double-peaked. The interpretation of these
differences within the context of the disk wind picture and suggestions for
their resolution via modifications to the assumed disk and outflow structure
are discussed.",2005-08-03T11:51:27Z
Radial and 2D Colour Properties of E+A Galaxies,"We investigated the radial colour gradient and two-dimensional (2D) colour
properties of 22 E+A galaxies with 5.5 < Hdelta equivalent width(EW) < 8.5\AA
and 49 normal early-type galaxies as a control sample at a redshift of <0.2 in
the Second Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We found that a
substantial number of E+A galaxies exhibit positive slopes of radial colour
gradient (bluer gradients toward the centre) which are seldom seen in normal
early-type galaxies. We found irregular 'colour morphologies'-- asymmetrical
and clumpy patterns -- at the centre of g-r and r-i 2D colour maps of E+A
galaxies with positive slopes of colour gradient. Kolomogorov-Smirnov
two-sample tests show that g-r and r-i colour gradient distributions of E+A
galaxies differ from those of early-type galaxies with a more than 99.99 per
cent significance level. We also found a tight correlation between radial
colour gradients and colours, and between radial colour gradients and the
4000-\AA break in the E+A sample; E+A galaxies which exhibit bluer colour or
weaker D4000 tend to have positive slopes of radial colour gradient. We
compared the GISSEL model and E+A observational quantities, Hdelta EW, D4000
and u-g colour, and found that almost all our E+A galaxies are situated along a
single evolutionary track. Therefore, these results are interpreted as E+A
galaxies evolving from Hdelta EW ~ 8 \AA to Hdelta EW ~ 5 \AA, with colour
gradients changing from positive to negative, and with the irregular 2D colour
map becoming smoother, during a time-scale of ~300 Myr. Our results favour the
hypothesis that E+A galaxies are post-starburst galaxies caused by
merger/interaction, having undergone a centralized violent starburst.",2005-07-05T13:53:17Z
"Pulsation and evolutionary masses of classical Cepheids. I. Milky Way
  variables","We investigate a selected sample of Galactic classical Cepheids with
available distance and reddening estimates in the framework of the theoretical
scenario provided by pulsation models, computed with metal abundance Z=0.02,
helium content in the range of Y=0.25 to 0.31, and various choices of the
stellar mass and luminosity. After transforming the bolometric light curve of
the fundamental models into BVRIJK magnitudes, we derived analytical relations
connecting the pulsation period with the stellar mass, the mean
(intensity-averaged) absolute magnitude, and the color of the pulsators. These
relations are used together with the Cepheid observed absolute magnitudes in
order to determine the ""pulsation"" mass -M_p- of each individual variable. The
comparison with the ""evolutionary"" masses -M_(e,can)- given by canonical (no
convective core overshooting, no mass-loss) models of central He-burning
stellar structures reveals that the M_p/M_(e,can) ratio is correlated with the
Cepheid period, ranging from about 0.8 at logP=0.5 to about 1 at logP=1.5. We
discuss the effects of different input physics and/or assumptions on the
evolutionary computations, as well as of uncertainties in the adopted Cepheid
metal content, distance, and reddening. Eventually, we find that the
pulsational results can be interpreted in terms of mass-loss during or before
the Cepheid phase, whose amount increases as the Cepheid original mass
decreases. It vanishes around 13M_(sun) and increases up to about 20% at
4M_(sun).",2005-05-08T10:11:58Z
"Evidence for a Weak Galactic Center Magnetic Field from Diffuse Low
  Frequency Nonthermal Radio Emission","New low-frequency 74 and 330 MHz observations of the Galactic center (GC)
region reveal the presence of a large-scale ($6\arcdeg\times 2\arcdeg$) diffuse
source of nonthermal synchrotron emission. A minimum energy analysis of this
emission yields a total energy of $\sim (\phi^{4/7}f^{3/7})\times 10^{52}$ ergs
and a magnetic field strength of $\sim 6(\phi/f)^{2/7}$ \muG (where $\phi$ is
the proton to electron energy ratio and $f$ is the filling factor of the
synchrotron emitting gas). The equipartition particle energy density is
$1.2(\phi/f)^{2/7}$ \evcm, a value consistent with cosmic-ray data. However,
the derived magnetic field is several orders of magnitude below the 1 mG field
commonly invoked for the GC. With this field the source can be maintained with
the SN rate inferred from the GC star formation. Furthermore, a strong magnetic
field implies an abnormally low GC cosmic-ray energy density. We conclude that
the mean magnetic field in the GC region must be weak, of order 10 \muG (at
least on size scales $\ga 125\arcsec$).",2005-05-12T09:36:21Z
Spectroscopic classification of cataclysmic variable candidates,"We present low resolution optical spectroscopy for six cataclysmic variable
candidates and the old nova V888 Cen. We confirm the classification as
cataclysmic variable for LB 9963 and FQ Mon, while the other four candidates
turn out to be different type of stars. We discuss the individual spectra and
pay special attention to the mass transfer rate and disc temperature and
density of the three cataclysmic variables.",2005-06-14T11:40:12Z
Stellar populations and Lya emission in two lensed z>~6 galaxies,"We present an analysis of two strongly lensed galaxies at z=6.56 and z ~ 7
for which multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations are available.
For one source the data include recent HST and Spitzer observations. Using an
SED fitting technique considering a number of parameters we attempt to
constrain the properties of their stellar populations and their intrinsic Lya
emission. The following main results are obtained for the individual galaxies:
* Triple arc in Abell 2218: The most likely redshift of this source is z ~
6.0-7.2. SED fits indicate generally a low extinction but do not strongly
constrain the star formation (SF) history. Best fits have typical ages of ~3 to
400 Myr. The apparent 4000Ang break observed recently from combination of
IRAC/Spitzer and HST observations, can also equally well be reproduced with the
template of a young (~3-5 Myr). The estimated SFR is typically ~1 Msun/yr, in
agreement with previous estimates. The unknowns on the age and star formation
history could easily explain the apparent absence of Lya in this galaxy. *
Abell 370 HCM 6A: The available Lya and continuum observations indicate two
possible solutions: 1) a young burst or ongoing constant SF with non-negligible
extinction or 2) a composite young+""old"" stellar population. In the first case
one obtains a best fit A_V ~ 0.5-1.8 at a 1 sigma level. In consequence we
obtain SFR ~ 11-41 Msun/yr, higher than earlier estimates, and we estimate a
fairly high total luminosity (L ~ (1-4)*10^{11} Lsun) for this galaxy, in the
range LIRG. A Lya transmission of ~23-90% is estimated from our best fit
models. Other properties remain largely unconstrained. In case of composite
stellar populations the SFR, mass, and luminosity estimate is lower. The two
scenarios may be distinguishable with IRAC/Spitzer observations at 3.6 and 4.5
micron.",2005-06-28T07:53:58Z
"Diffuse light in z~0.25 galaxy clusters: constraining tidal damage and
  the faint end of the Luminosity Function","The starlight coming from the intergalactic space in galaxy clusters and
groups witnesses the violent tidal interactions that galaxies experience in
these dense environments. Such interactions may be (at least partly)
responsible for the transformation of normal star-forming galaxies into passive
dwarf ellipticals (dEs). In this contribution we present the first systematic
study of the IntraCluster Light (ICL) for a statistically representative sample
(Zibetti et al. 2005), which comprises 683 clusters selected between z=0.2 and
0.3 from ~1500 deg^2 in the SDSS. Their ICL is studied by stacking the images
in the g-, r-, and i-band after masking out all galaxies and polluting sources.
In this way a very uniform background illumination is obtained, that allows us
to measure surface brightnesses as faint as 31 mag/arcsec^2 and to trace the
ICL out to 700 kpc from the central galaxy. We find that the local fraction of
light contributed by intracluster stars rapidly decreases as a function of the
clustercentric distance, from ~40% at 100 kpc to ~5% at 500 kpc. By comparing
the distribution and colours of the ICL and of the clusters galaxies, we find
indication that the main source of ICL are the stars stripped from galaxies
that plunge deeply into the cluster potential well along radial orbits. Thus,
if dEs are the remnants of these stripped progenitors we should expect similar
radial orbital anisotropies and correlations between the dE luminosity function
and the amount of ICL in different clusters. The diffuse emission we measure is
contaminated by faint unresolved galaxies: this makes our flux estimate depend
to some extent on the assumed luminosity function, but, on the other hand,
allows us to constrain the number of faint galaxies. Our present results
disfavour steep (alpha<-1.35) faint-end powerlaw slopes.",2005-04-21T07:47:42Z
"Upper limit on the primary photon fraction from the Pierre Auger
  Observatory","Based on observations of the depth of shower maximum performed with the
hybrid detector of the Auger Observatory, an upper limit on the cosmic-ray
photon fraction of 26% (at 95% confidence level) is derived for primary
energies above 10^19 eV. Additional observables recorded with the surface
detector array, available for a sub-set of the data sample, support the
conclusion that a photon origin of the observed events is not favoured.",2005-07-18T10:41:29Z
The Minimum Stellar Mass in Early Galaxies,"The conditions for the fragmentation of the baryonic component during merging
of dark matter halos in the early Universe are studied. We assume that the
baryonic component undergoes a shock compression. The characteristic masses of
protostellar molecular clouds and the minimum masses of protostars formed in
these clouds decrease with increasing halo mass. This may indicate that the
initial stellar mass function in more massive galaxies was shifted towards
lower masses during the initial stages of their formation. This would result in
an increase of the number of stars per unit halo mass, i.e., the efficiency of
star formation.",2005-06-30T11:18:00Z
UCDs in Fornax and Abell 1689,"We review some properties of ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in Fornax and
of their brighter counterparts in Abell 1689, among which are two M32 twins,
and discuss various possible UCD formation scenarios. We note that it is
indispensable to carefully take into account the bright end of the globular
cluster luminosity function when estimating the number density of UCDs. It is
suggested that the search for more luminous UCDs in dense and rich galaxy
clusters is the best way towards establishing UCDs as a new class of galaxies.",2005-05-10T12:07:07Z
"Interpretation of the Radio/X-ray Knots of AGN Jets within the Internal
  Shock Model Framework","The dynamics of relativistically moving blobs ejected out of a central AGN,
are considered. It is assumed that the collision between two blobs are
completely inelastic, such that the bulk kinetic energy lost in the collision
is used to energize electrons to relativistic energies via acceleration in
internal shocks which are formed due to the collision. These high energy
electrons which are produced on a time-scale corresponding to the collision
time-scale, cool by radiative losses due to synchrotron and Inverse Compton
processes. The model is applied to the radio/X-ray knots of several AGN. For
three of these sources we have analyzed long (> 40 ksec) Chandra observations
and report on constrains on the X-ray spectral indices. In the framework of
this model the AGN are inferred to sporadically eject relativistic blobs on
time-scales ranging from 10^{11} to 10^{12} secs for different sources. It is
shown that the collision time-scales can be longer than the age of the knot
and, hence, non-thermal electrons are continuously being injected into the
system. This continuous injection, in contrast to an instantaneous one time
injection, gives rise to a characteristic spectral break, rather than a
high-energy cutoff in the spectrum.",2005-04-08T09:24:42Z
Dissipationless Merging and the Assembly of Central Galaxies,"We reanalyze the galaxy-mass correlation function measured by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey to obtain host dark matter halo masses at galaxy and galaxy
group scales. We extend the data to galaxy clusters in the 2MASS catalog and
study the relation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass. While the
central galaxy luminosity scales as ~M^{0.7-0.8} at low masses, the relation
flattens to ~M^{<0.3} above ~4x10^{13} M_sun. The total luminosity of galaxies
in the halo, however, continues to grow as a power-law ~M^{0.8-0.9}. Starting
from the hypothesis that the central galaxies grow by merging (""galactic
cannibalism""), we develop a simple model for the evolution of their
luminosities as a consequence of the accretion of satellite galaxies. The
luminosity-mass relation flattens when the time scale on which dynamical
friction induces orbital decay in the satellite galaxies exceeds the age of the
dark matter halo. Then, the growth of the central galaxy is suppressed as it
can cannibalize only the rare, massive satellite galaxies. The model takes the
dependence of the total luminosity of galaxies in a halo on its mass and the
global galaxy luminosity function as input, and reproduces the observed central
galaxy luminosity-mass relation over three decades in halo mass,
(10^{12}-10^{15}) M_sun.
  The success of the model suggests that gas cooling and subsequent star
formation did not play an important role in the final assembly of central
galaxies from sub-L_star precursors.",2005-03-29T05:32:03Z
"The Las Campanas Infra-red Survey. V. Keck Spectroscopy of a large
  sample of Extremely Red Objects","(Abridged) We present deep Keck spectroscopy, using the DEIMOS and LRIS
spectrographs, of a large and representative sample of 67 ``Extremely Red
Objects'' (EROs) to H=20.5, with I-H>3.0, in three of the Las Campanas Infrared
Survey fields. Spectroscopic redshifts are determined for 44 sources, of which
only two are contaminating low mass stars. When allowance is made for
incompleteness, the spectroscopic redshift distribution closely matches that
predicted earlier on the basis of photometric data. Our spectra are of
sufficient quality that we can address the important question of the nature and
homogeneity of the z>0.8 ERO population. A dominant old stellar population is
inferred for 75% of our spectroscopic sample; a higher fraction than that seen
in smaller, less-complete samples with broader photometric selection criteria
(e.g. R-K). However, only 28% have spectra with no evidence of recent star
formation activity, such as would be expected for a strictly passively-evolving
population. More than ~30% of our absorption line spectra are of the `E+A' type
with prominent Balmer absorption consistent, on average, with mass growth of
5-15% in the past Gyr. We use our spectroscopic redshifts to improve earlier
estimates of the spatial clustering of this population as well as to understand
the significant field-to-field variation. Our spectroscopy enables us to
pinpoint a filamentary structure at z=1.22 in the Chandra Deep Field South.
Overall, our study suggests that the bulk of the ERO population is an
established population of clustered massive galaxies undergoing intermittent
activity consistent with continued growth over the redshift interval 0.8<z<1.6.",2005-05-06T11:04:10Z
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station,"The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a particle physics detector designed

direct detection of charged particles in the rigidity range from 0.5 GV to few
TV to perform high statistics studies of cosmic rays in space and search for
antimatter and dark matter. This will be possible because of the large
geometrical acceptance, a very accurate energy determination and a very precise

"Seismic diagnostics of mixing beyond the convective core in intermediate
  mass main-sequence stars","We study prospects for seismic sounding the layer of a partial mixing above
the convective core in main-sequence stars with masses in the 1.2 -- 1.9 solar
mass range. There is an initial tendency to an increase of convective core mass
in such stars and this leads to ambiguities in modeling. Solar-like
oscillations are expected to be excited in such objects. Frequencies of such
oscillations provide diagnostics, which are sensitive to the structure of the
innermost part of the star and they are known as the small separations. We
construct evolutionary models of stars in this mass range assuming various
scenarios for element mixing, which includes formation of element abundance
jumps, as well as semiconvective and overshooting layers. We find that the
three point small separations employing frequencies of radial and dipole modes
provide the best probe of the element distribution above the convective core.
With expected accuracy of frequency measurement from the space experiments, a
discrimination between various scenarios should be possible.",2005-05-25T22:33:22Z
An Unusual System of HI Filaments near WR 5 and HD 17603,"We report the discovery of a system of unusual HI filaments which appear to
be associated with molecular clouds in the Perseus spiral arm of our Galaxy. We
investigate the hypothesis that this system is the result of a directed flow of
dissociated gas from clouds trapped within an extended wind flow from massive
stars. The Wolf-Rayet star WR 5 and the OIb(f) star HD 17603 are identified as
candidate driving sources. However, an examination of this hypothesis within
the context of the theory of mass-loaded winds shows that these two stars alone
cannot account for the energetics and kinematics of the required spherically
symmetric wind flow. Unless the apparent association between HI, molecular gas,
and stars is an accidental one, we suggest that other as-yet unidentified stars
must have contributed to driving the filaments.",2005-05-18T19:57:00Z
"The imprints of local superclusters on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signals
  and their detectability with Planck","We use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of large-scale structure
formation to study the imprints of the local superclusters onto the full-sky
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals. Following (Mathis et al. 2002), the initial
conditions have been statistically constrained to reproduce the density field
within a sphere of 110 Mpc around the Milky Way, as observed in the IRAS 1.2-Jy
all-sky redshift survey. As a result, the positions and masses of prominent
galaxy clusters and superclusters in our simulations coincide closely with
their real counterparts in the local universe. We present the results of two
different runs, one with adiabatic gas physics only, and one also including
cooling, star formation and feedback. By analysing the full-sky maps for the
thermal and kinetic SZ signals extracted from these simulations, we find that
for multipoles with l<100 the power spectrum is dominated by the prominent
local superclusters, and its amplitude at these scales is a factor of two
higher than that obtained from unconstrained simulations; at lower multipoles
(l<20) this factor can even reach one order of magnitude. We check the
influence of the SZ effect from local superclusters on the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) power spectrum at small multipoles and find it negligible and
with no signs of quadrupole-octopole alignment. However, performing simulations
of the CMB radiation including the experimental noise at the frequencies which
will be observed by the Planck satellite, we find results suggesting that an
estimate of the SZ power spectrum at large scales can be extracted.",2005-05-12T14:43:53Z
Nearby star cluster formation: Probes of cosmological galaxy evolution,"(abridged) The old Star Cluster (SC) systems surrounding any sofar
investigated galaxy represent a powerful tool for the understanding of the
cosmological evolution of their host galaxies. Phases of enhanced cluster
formation can be identified by reliably age dating the clusters. These are
symptoms of violent star formation, results of intense starbursts as commonly
seen in merging nearby galaxies and high-z forming galaxies. However, the young
SC systems of nearby merging galaxies and the old SC systems of nearby passive
galaxies (most likely resulting from high-z starburst events of these galaxies)
appear to be significantly different in terms of their mass functions. Whether
this difference originates in differences in the formation physics/environment
or is only due to dynamical evolution of the cluster systems is currently a hot
issue. A main diagnostic for the survival probability of a newly formed cluster
is most likely its compactness, since less compact, fluffy clusters are more
vulnerable to destructive interactions with the galactic environment of the
cluster. For these reasons, we developed
  1) a tool to significantly improve photometry of nearby SCs (which appear
resolved on high-resolution images, provided e.g. by HST), by accurately
measuring and taking the cluster size into account, and
  2) a tool to effectively determine ages and masses (plus metallicities and
extinctions) of SCs from multi-wavelength photometry, ranging from the UV to
the NIR.",2005-07-12T09:28:05Z
"A first look with Chandra at SGR 1806-20 after the Giant Flare:
  significant spectral softening and rapid flux decay","We report on the results of a ~30 ks Chandra pointing of the soft gamma-ray
repeater SGR 1806-20, the first X-ray observation with high spectral resolution
performed after the 2004 December 27 Giant Flare. The source was found in a
bursting active phase and with a significantly softer spectrum than that of the
latest observations before the Giant Flare. The observed flux in the 2-10 keV
range was ~2.2 x10^-11 erg/s/cm^2, about 20% lower than that measured three
months before the event. This indicates that, although its giant flare was ~100
times more intense than those previously observed in two other soft gamma-ray
repeaters, the post flare X-ray flux decay of SGR 1806-20 has been much faster.
The pulsed fraction was about 3%, a smaller value than that observed before the
flare. We discuss the different properties of the post-flare evolution of SGR
1806-20 in comparison to those of SGR 1900+14 and interpret the results as a
strong evidence that a magnetospheric untwisting occurred (or is occurring)
after the Giant Flare.",2005-05-10T14:33:32Z
"First evidence for a spatially resolved disk structure around the Herbig

the wavelength range 8-13 micron on a ~6 AU scale with a non-symmetric
intensity distribution, providing support for an inclined disk geometry.
Visibilities are best fitted using a uniform ring model with outer radius in
the range 6-10 AU, in the wavelength range 8-13 micron. The inclination of the

perturbations may be damped after inflation. This would imply that CMB
anisotropies do not uniquely fix the amplitude of the perturbations generated
during inflation and that the present tensor-to-scalar ratio might be larger
than produced in inflation, increasing the prospects of detection of primordial
gravitational radiation. It turns out, however, that the damping of density
perturbations is hard to achieve.",2005-07-25T14:27:21Z
"VLA Imaging of the Intriguing HI Cloud HIJASS J1021+6842 in the M81
  Group","We present VLA HI 21cm observations of HIJASS J1021+6842 which has been
discovered in the direction of the M81 group. Our synthesis imaging reveals
that the HI is distributed over a larger angular extent and velocity range than
the single dish discovery observations. Assuming that HIJASS J1021+6842 is at
the distance of the M81 group, we detect 1.5 x 10^8 M_sun of HI distributed
over as much as 30 kpc, i.e., substantially larger than the biggest dwarf
galaxies in the same group. At the depth of our imaging, the HI appears to be
confined to at least 7 clouds. Peak HI column densities are ~1.8 x 10^20 atoms
cm^-2 which is well below the canonical star formation threshold of ~10^21
atoms cm^-2 and therefore consistent with the fact that no optical counterpart
has as yet been identified. A gradient in velocity is observed across the
extent of the detected HI; assuming that the object is gravitationally bound we
derive a dynamical mass of 7 x 10^9 M_sun and a dark-to-luminous mass ratio of
>10. Alternatively, a tidal origin may also result in the observed velocity
gradient which would lead to a considerably lower dynamical mass. Given the
above properties and the absence of evidence of a stellar population, HIJASS
J1021+6842 is unique amongst the other systems in the M81 group.",2005-06-02T08:09:53Z
Exact solution of the standard transfer problem in a stellar atmosphere,"We come back to the analytical solution of the standard transfer problem in a
stellar atmosphere. It consists in solving the radiative transfer equation in a
homogeneous and isothermal plane-parallel atmosphere, with light scattering
taken as isotropic and monochromatic. The literature on the subject is reviewed
and the existing solution in a finite slab is improved thanks to the
introduction of non classical auxiliary functions. Eleven-figure tables of the
solution are given for typical values of the input parameters currently met in
stellar atmospheres.",2005-04-03T13:59:17Z
Search for Pulsed VHE gamma-ray Emission from Young Pulsars with H.E.S.S,"Pulsars are commonly regarded as highly magnetized neutron stars, rotating up
to several hundred times per second. Over 1,500 radio pulsars have been found
so far, about 70 of which are X-ray pulsars, but only a handful have been
observed in gamma rays. This high-energy emission is believed to be produced by
the electrons accelerated to TeV energies in the pulsar magnetosphere,
resulting in cascades of secondary particles. The H.E.S.S. experiment is a
system of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia, which is
sensitive to gamma rays above 100 GeV. Three young pulsars, Crab, Vela, and PSR
B1706-44 have been observed with H.E.S.S. The results of the search for pulsed
emission for these targets, and the constraints on the theories of pulsed very
high energy gamma-ray emission, are summarized here.",2005-07-17T05:54:18Z

"Instrument, Method, Brightness and Polarization Maps from the 2003
  flight of BOOMERanG","We present the BOOMERanG-03 experiment and maps of the Stokes parameters I,
Q, U of the microwave sky obtained during a 14 day balloon flight in 2003.
Three regions of the southern sky were surveyed: a deep survey (~ 90 square
degrees) and a shallow survey (~ 750 square degrees) at high Galactic latitudes
(both centered at RA ~ 5.5 h, dec ~ -45 deg) and a survey of ~ 300 square
degrees across the Galactic plane at RA ~ 9.1 h, dec ~ -47 deg. All three
surveys were carried out in three wide frequency bands centered at 145, 245 and
345 GHz, with an angular resolution of ~ 10'. The 145 GHz maps of Stokes I are
dominated by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy, which is
mapped with high signal to noise ratio. The measured anisotropy pattern is
consistent with the pattern measured in the same region by BOOMERanG-98 and by
WMAP. The 145 GHz maps of Stokes Q and U provide a robust statistical detection
of polarization of the CMB when subjected to a power spectrum analysis. This
amplitude of the polarization is consistent with that of the CMB in the
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological scenario. At 145 GHz, in the CMB surveys, the
intensity and polarization of the astrophysical foregrounds are found to be
negligible with respect to the cosmological signal. At 245 and 345 GHz we
detect ISD emission correlated to the 3000 GHz IRAS/DIRBE maps, and give upper
limits for any other non-CMB component. We also present intensity maps of the
surveyed section of the Galactic plane. These are compared to monitors of
different interstellar components, showing that a variety of emission
mechanisms is present in that region.",2005-07-21T12:32:08Z
The rates of Type Ia Supernovae. I. Analytical Formulations,"This paper provides a handy tool to compute the impact of Type Ia Supernova
(SNIa) on the evolution of stellar systems. An effective formalism is presented
to couple the SNIa rate to the star formation history, which rests upon the
definition of two key properties of the progenitor's model: the realization
probability of the SNIa event from a single stellar generation and the
distribution function of the delay times. It is shown that the current SNIa
rate in late type galaxies implies that the realization probability is on the
order of 0.001. Analytical formulations for the distribution function of the
delay times for Single (SD) and Double Degenerate (DD) progenitors are derived,
based on stellar evolution arguments. These formulations, which agree well with
the results of Monte Carlo simulations for the evolution of close binaries,
have a built in parametrization of the key properties of the alternative
candidates. The various models for the progenitors have different impact on the
large scales. In particular, the paper examines the systematic trend of the
SNIa rate per unit mass with the color of the parent galaxy, and shows that the
recent observations favor the DD model. The SD scenario can reproduce the data
only if the distribution of the primordial mass ratios is flat, and the
accretion efficiency onto the WD is close to 100%. The timescale for the Fe
release from SNIa to the interstellar medium ranges between 0.3 and 3 Gyr for a
wide variety of hypothesis on the SNIa progenitors. (ABRIDGED)",2005-04-18T07:43:21Z
"The effect of wavefront corrugations on fringe motion in an astronomical
  interferometer with spatial filters","Numerical simulations of atmospheric turbulence and AO wavefront correction
are performed to investigate the timescale for fringe motion in optical
interferometers with spatial filters. These simulations focus especially on
partial AO correction, where only a finite number of Zernike modes are
compensated. The fringe motion is found to depend strongly on both the aperture
diameter and the level of AO correction used. In all of the simulations the
coherence timescale for interference fringes is found to decrease dramatically
when the Strehl ratio provided by the AO correction is <~30%. For AO systems
which give perfect compensation of a limited number of Zernike modes, the
aperture size which gives the optimum signal for fringe phase tracking is
calculated. For AO systems which provide noisy compensation of Zernike modes
(but are perfectly piston-neutral), the noise properties of the AO system
determine the coherence timescale of the fringes when the Strehl ratio is
<~30%.",2005-06-07T09:43:32Z
The Progenitor of Supernova 2004dj in a Star Cluster,"The progenitor of type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2004dj is identified with a
supergiant in a compact star cluster known as ""Sandage Star 96"" (S96) in the
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2403, which was fortuitously imaged as part of the
Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey from Feb 1995
to Dec 2003 prior to SN 2004dj. The superior photometry of BATC images for S96,
taken with 14 intermediate-band filters covering 3000-10000\AA, unambiguously
establishes the star cluster nature of S96 with an age of $\sim 20$Myr, a
reddening of $\hbox{E}(B-V)\sim 0.35$ mag and a total mass of $\sim
96,000$M$_{\odot}$. The compact star cluster nature of S96 is also consistent
with the lack of light variations in the past decade. The SN progenitor is
estimated to have a main-sequence mass of $\sim$12M$_{\odot}$. The comparison
of our intermediate-band data of S96 with the post-outburst photometry obtained
as the SN has significantly dimmed, may hopefully conclusively establish the
nature of the progenitor.",2005-05-14T01:22:06Z

misunderstanding of GR and (ii) completely misconceived ``thought

Multi-phase High-Velocity Clouds toward HE 0226-4110 and PG 0953+414,"We study the physical conditions, elemental abundances, and kinematics of the
high-velocity clouds (HVCs) along the sight lines toward active galaxies
HE0226-4110 and PG0953+414 using Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer data. Our observations reveal
multiple components of HVC absorption in lines of HI, CII, CIII, CIV, OVI,
SiII, SiIII, and SiIV in both directions. We investigate whether
photoionization by the extragalactic background radiation or by escaping Milky
Way radiation can explain the observed ionization pattern. We find that
photoionization is a good explanation for the CII, CIII, SiII, and SiIII
features, but not for the OVI or CIV associated with the HVCs, suggesting that
two principal phases exist: a warm (T~10^4K), photoionized phase and a hotter
(T=1-3x10^5K), collisionally-ionized phase. The warm HVCs toward HE0226-4110
have high levels of ionization (97-99%), and metallicities ([Z/H] between -0.9
and -0.4) close to those in the Magellanic Stream, which lies eleven degrees
away on the sky at similar velocities. These HVCs have thermal pressures that
would place them close to equilibrium in a fully ionized 10^6 K Galactic corona
with n_H=4-9x10^{-5}cm^{-3} at 50 kpc. A mini-survey of the hot, collisionally
ionized HVC components seen here and in five other sight lines finds that in
11/12 cases, the high ions have kinematics and ionic ratios that are consistent
with an origin in conductive interfaces. However, the broad absorption wing on
the OVI profile toward PG0953+414 is not completely explained by the interface
scenario, and may be tracing the outflow of hot gas into the Milky Way halo as
part of a Galactic fountain or wind.",2005-05-13T20:00:32Z

companion star in LMXBs. We present a numerical code to simulate time-delayed
transfer functions in LMXBs, specific to the case of reprocessing in emission
lines. The code is also able to obtain geometrical and binary parameters by
fitting observed (X-ray + optical) light curves using simulated annealing

"XMM-Newton Surveys of the Canada-France Redshift Survey Fields - III:
  The Environments of X-ray Selected AGN at 0.4<z<0.6","The environmental properties of a sample of 31 hard X-ray selected AGN are
investigated, from scales of 500 kpc down to 30 kpc, and are compared to a
control sample of inactive galaxies. The AGN all lie in the redshift range
0.4<z<0.6. The accretion luminosity-density of the Universe peaks close to this
redshift range, and the AGN in the sample have X-ray luminosities close to the
knee in the hard X-ray luminosity function, making them representative of the
population which dominated this important phase of energy conversion.
  Using both the spatial clustering amplitude and near neighbour counts it is
found that the AGN have environments that are indistinguishable from normal,
inactive galaxies over the same redshift range and with similar optical
properties. Typically, the environments are of sub-cluster richness, in
contrast to similar studies of high-z quasars, which are often found in
clusters with comparable richness to the Abell R>=0 clusters.
  It is suggested that minor mergers with low mass companions is a likely
candidate for the mechanism by which these modest luminosity AGN are fuelled.",2005-08-03T13:17:44Z
"High Energy Afterglow Emission from Giant Flares of Soft Gamma-Ray
  Repeaters: The Case of the 2004 December 27 Event from SGR 1806-20","We discuss the high enegry afterglow emission (including high energy photons,
neutrinos and cosmic rays) following the 2004 December 27 Giant Flare from SGR
1806-20. If the initial outflow is relativistic with a bulk Lorentz factor
\Gamma_0\sim {\rm tens}, the high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission from
electrons in the forward shock region gives rise to a prominent sub-GeV
emission, if the electron spectrum is hard enough and if the intial Lorentz
factor is high enough. This signal could serve as a diagnosis of the initial
Lorentz factor of the giant flare outflow. This component is potentially
detectable by GLAST if a similar giant flare occurs in the GLAST era. With the
available 10 MeV data, we constrain that \Gamma_0 < 50 if the electron
distribution is a single power law. For a broken power law distribution of
electrons, a higher \Gamma_0 is allowed. At energies higher than 1 GeV, the
flux is lower because of a high energy cut off of the synchrotron emission
component. The synchrotron self-Compton emission component and the inverse
Compton scattering component off the photons in the giant flare oscillation
tail are also considered, but they are found not significant given a moderate
\Gamma_0 (e.g. \leq 10). The forward shock also accelerates cosmic rays to the
maximum energy 10^{17}eV, and generate neutrinos with a typical energy
10^{14}eV through photomeson interaction with the X-ray tail photons. However,
they are too weak to be detectable.",2005-05-23T20:47:51Z
GRB Progenitors and Environment,"The study and knowledge of the environment of Gamma-Ray Bursts is of great
interest from many points of view. For high redshift (z>0.5) events, the
structure of the ambient medium is one of the best indicators of the nature and
properties of the progenitor. It also tells us about the last stages of the
pre-explosion evolution of the progenitor. In addition, it is interesting in
its own as a sample of the interstellar medium in a high redshift galaxy.
Measures of the density and structure of the GRB environment are however
sparse, and different methods yield different, often incompatible, results. I
will review the methods and results with particular emphasis on the case of GRB
021004, a puzzling but highly informative event. I will finally underline the
advancements that will be possible in the Swift era.",2005-05-03T18:36:31Z
"Ionization States and Plasma Structures of Mixed-morphology SNRs
  Observed with ASCA","We present the results of a systematic study using ASCA of the ionization
state for six ``mixed-morphology'' supernova emnants (MMSNRs): IC 443, W49B,
W28, W44, 3C391, and Kes 27. MMSNRs show centrally filled thermal X-ray
emission, which contrasts to shell-like radio morphology, a set of
haracteristics at odds with the standard model of SNR evolution (e.g., the
Sedov model). We have therefore studied the evolution of the MMSNRs from the
ionization conditions inferred from the X-ray spectra, independent of X-ray
morphology. We find highly ionized plasmas approaching ionization equilibrium
in all the mmsnrs. The degree of ionization is systematically higher than the
plasma usually seen in shell-like SNRs. Radial temperature gradients are also
observed in five remnants, with cooler plasma toward the limb. In IC 443 and
W49B, we find a plasma structure consistent with shell-like SNRs, suggesting
that at least some MMSNRs have experienced similar evolution to shell-like
SNRs. In addition to the results above, we have discovered an ``overionized''
ionization state in W49B, in addition to that previously found in IC 443.
Thermal conduction can cause the hot interior plasma to become overionized by
reducing the temperature and density gradients, leading to an interior density
increase and temperature decrease. Therefore, we suggest that the
``center-filled'' X-ray morphology develops as the result of thermal
conduction, and should arise in all SNRs. This is consistent with the results
that MMSNRs are near collisional ionization equilibrium since the conduction
timescale is roughly similar to the ionization timescale. Hence, we conclude
that MMSNRs are those that have evolved over$\sim10^4$ yr. We call this phase
as the ``conduction phase.''",2005-07-14T14:52:21Z
"Evidence for a fundamental stellar upper mass limit from clustered star
  formation, and some implications therof","Theoretical considerations lead to the expectation that stars should not have
masses larger than about m_{max*}=60-120Msun, while the observational evidence
has been ambiguous. Only very recently has a physical stellar mass limit near
150Msun emerged thanks to modern high-resolution observations of local
star-burst clusters. But this limit does not appear to depend on metallicity,
in contradiction to theory. Important uncertainties remain though. It is now
also emerging that star-clusters limit the masses of their constituent stars,
such that a well-defined relation between the mass of the most massive star in
a cluster and the cluster mass, m_{max}=F(M_ecl) \le m_{max*}\approx 150Msun,
exists. One rather startling finding is that the observational data strongly
favour clusters being built-up by consecutively forming more-massive stars
until the most massive stars terminate further star-formation. The relation
also implies that composite populations, which consist of many star clusters,
most of which may be dissolved, must have steeper composite IMFs than simple
stellar populations such as are found in individual clusters. Thus, for
example, 10^5 Taurus--Auriga star-forming groups, each with 20 stars, will ever
only sample the IMF below about 1Msun. This IMF will therefore not be identical
to the IMF of one cluster with 2 times 10^6 stars. The implication is that the
star-formation history of a galaxy critically determines its integrated
galaxial IMF and thus the total number of supernovae per star and its chemical
enrichment history. Galaxy formation and evolution models that rely on an
invariant IMF would be wrong.",2005-07-25T20:05:50Z
"Constraining the mass transfer in massive binaries through progenitor
  evolution models of Wolf-Rayet+O binaries","Since close WR+O binaries are the result of a strong interaction of both
stars in massive close binary systems, they can be used to constrain the highly
uncertain mass and angular momentum budget during the major mass transfer
phase. We explore the progenitor evolution of the three best suited WR+O
binaries HD 90657, HD 186943 and HD 211853, which are characterized by a WR/O
mass ratio of $\sim$0.5 and periods of 6..10 days. We are doing so at three
different levels of approximation: predicting the massive binary evolution
through simple mass loss and angular momentum loss estimates, through full
binary evolution models with parametrized mass transfer efficiency, and through
binary evolution models including rotation of both components and a physical
model which allows to compute mass and angular momentum loss from the binary
system as function of time during the mass transfer process. All three methods
give consistently the same answers. Our results show that, if these systems
formed through stable mass transfer, their initial periods were smaller than
their current ones, which implies that mass transfer has started during the
core hydrogen burning phase of the initially more massive star. Furthermore,
the mass transfer in all three cases must have been highly non-conservative,
with on average only $\sim$10% of the transferred mass being retained by the
mass receiving star. This result gives support to our system mass and angular
momentum loss model, which predicts that, in the considered systems, about 90%
of the overflowing matter is expelled by the rapid rotation of the mass
receiver close to the $\Omega$-limit, which is reached through the accretion of
the remaining 10%.",2005-04-11T14:16:46Z
"The Warm, Cold and Very Cold Dusty Universe","We are living in a dusty universe: dust is ubiquitously seen in a wide
variety of astrophysical environments, ranging from circumstellar envelopes
around cool red giants to supernova ejecta, from diffuse and dense interstellar
clouds and star-forming regions to debris disks around main-sequence stars,
from comets to interplanetary space to distant galaxies and quasars. In this
review I focus on interstellar grains, with particular emphasis on the
extinction (absorption plus scattering) and emission properties of cold
submicron-sized ``classical'' grains which, in thermal equilibrium with the
ambient interstellar radiation field, obtain a steady-state temperature of
\~15--25K, warm nano-sized (or smaller) ""ultrasmall"" grains which are, upon
absorption of an energetic photon, transiently heated to temperatures as high
as a few hundred to over 1000K, and the possible existence of a population of
very cold (< 10K) dust. Whether dust grains can really get down to
""temperature"" less than the 2.7K cosmic microwave background radiation
temperature will also be discussed. The robustness of the
silicate-graphite-PAHs interstellar dust model is demonstrated by showing that
the infrared emission predicted from this model closely matches that observed
for the Milky Way, the Small Magellanic Cloud, and the ringed Sb galaxy

"Overview of the ISM Phases: Evolution of Large and Small Scale
  Structures in 3D high resolution HD and MHD simulations","We review recent 3D high resolution numerical HD and MHD studies of a
multi-component and multi-phase ISM. The computational grid was chosen large
enough in the disk to represent typical ISM gas patterns, and in the halo to
include the full extent of the Galactic fountain. The evolution of the ISM is
driven by supernovae of all types and followed for 400 Myrs, long enough to get
rid of memory effects of the initial distributions. The results are
substantially different from previous classical analytical models and entail:
(i) a very inhomogeneous distribution of ISM gas, (ii) a high level of
supernova driven turbulence, (iii) an active Galactic fountain flow, reaching
out to about 5 kpc on either side of the disk, (iv) a low volume filling factor
for the hot gas of about 20%, (v) a very weak correlation between magnetic
field and gas density, n, for n < 100 cm^-3, and, (vi) about 50% of the gas

A Search For Organic Molecules in Intermediate Redshift DLAs,"There has been a renewed interest in searching for diffuse interstellar bands

that metallicity plays a large role in DIB strengths.",2005-05-10T22:05:52Z
"Global MHD Modelling of the ISM - From large towards small scale
  turbulence","Dealing numerically with the turbulent nature and non-linearity of the
physical processes involved in the ISM requires the use of sophisticated
numerical schemes coupled to HD and MHD mathematical models. SNe are the main
drivers of the interstellar turbulence by transferring kinetic energy into the
system. This energy is dissipated by shocks (which is more efficient) and by
molecular viscosity. We carried out adaptive mesh refinement simulations (with
a finest resolution of 0.625 pc) of the turbulent ISM embedded in a magnetic
field with mean field components of 2 and 3 $\mu$G. The time scale of our run
was 400 Myr, sufficiently long to avoid memory effects of the initial setup,
and to allow for a global dynamical equilibrium to be reached in case of a
constant energy input rate. It is found that the longitudinal and transverse
turbulent length scales have a time averaged (over a period of 50 Myr) ratio of
0.52-0.6, almost similar to the one expected for isotropic homogeneous
turbulence. The mean characteristic size of the larger eddies is found to be
\~75 pc in both runs. In order to check the simulations against observations,
we monitored the OVI and HI column densities within a superbubble created by
the explosions of 19 SNe having masses and velocities of the stars that
exploded in vicinity of the Sun generating the Local Bubble. The model
reproduces the FUSE absorption measurements towards 25 white dwarfs of the \ovi
column density as function of distance and of \nhi. In particular for lines of
sight with lengths smaller than 120 pc it is found that there is no correlation
between N(OVI) and N(HI).",2005-05-04T12:34:18Z
Correlation of Low z Lyman-alpha Absorbers with HI-selected Galaxies,"In this work, observational evidence for the connection between low column
density Lyman-alpha absorbers and large-scale structure traced by gas-rich
galaxies is investigated. The HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) galaxy
catalogue is cross-correlated with known low redshift, low column density
Lyman-alpha absorbers from the literature. The absorber-galaxy
cross-correlation function shows that on scales from 1 to 10 h^-1 Mpc,
absorbers are imbedded in halos with masses similar to that of galaxy groups.
This statistical evidence suggests that galaxy groups could be the dominant
environment of low column density Lyman-alpha absorbers at z=0.",2005-04-22T13:36:00Z

"Ejection of high-velocity stars from the Galactic Center by an
  inspiraling Intermediate-Mass Black Hole","The presence of young stars in the immediate vicinity and strong tidal field
of SgrA* remains unexplained. One currently popular idea for their origin
posits that the stars were bused in by an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH)
which has inspiraled into the Galactic Center a few million years ago.
  Yu and Tremaine (2003) have argued that in this case some of the old stars in
the SgrA* cusp would be ejected by hard gravitational collisions with the IMBH.
Here we derive a general expression for the phase-space distribution of the
ejected high-velocity stars, given the distribution function of the stars in
the cusp. We compute it explicitly for the Peebles-Young distribution function
of the cusp, and make a detailed model for the time-dependent ejection of stars
during the IMBH inspiral. We find that (1) the stars are ejected in a burst
lasting a few dynamical friction timescales; if the ejected stars are detected
by Gaia they are likely to be produced by a single inspiral event, (2) if the
inspiral is circular than in the beginning of the burst the velocity vectors of
the ejected stars cluster around the inspiral plane, but rapidly isotropise as
the burst proceeds, (3) if the inspiral is eccentric, then the stars are
ejected in a broad jet roughly perpendicular to the Runge-Lenz vector of the
IMBH orbit. In a typical cusp the orbit will precess with a period of \sim 10^5
years, and the rate of ejection into our part of the Galaxy (as defined by e.g.
the Gaia visibility domain) will be modulated periodically. Gaia, together with
the ground-based follow-up observations, will be able to clock many
high-velocity stars back to their ejection from the Galactic Center, thus
measuring some of the above phenomena. This would provide a clear signature of
the IMBH inspiral in the past 10--20 Myr.",2005-08-08T15:02:49Z
"Statistical Analysis of Galaxy Surveys-II. The 3-point galaxy
  correlation function measured from the 2dFGRS","We present new results for the 3-point correlation function, \zeta, measured
as a function of scale, luminosity and colour from the final version of the
two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). The reduced three point
correlation function, Q_3 is estimated for different triangle shapes and sizes,
employing a full covariance analysis. The form of Q_3 is consistent with the
expectations for the \Lambda-cold dark matter model, confirming that the
primary influence shaping the distribution of galaxies is gravitational
instability acting on Gaussian primordial fluctuations. However, we find a
clear offset in amplitude between Q_3 for galaxies and the predictions for the
dark matter. We are able to rule out the scenario in which galaxies are
unbiased tracers of the mass at the 9-sigma level. On weakly non-linear scales,
we can interpret our results in terms of galaxy bias parameters. We find a
linear bias term that is consistent with unity, b_1 = 0.93^{+0.10}_{-0.08} and
a quadratic bias c_2 = b_2 /b_1 = -0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.08}. This is the first
significant detection of a non-zero quadratic bias, indicating a small but
important non-gravitational contribution to the three point function. Our
estimate of the linear bias from the three point function is independent of the
normalisation of underlying density fluctuations, so we can combine this with
the measurement of the power spectrum of 2dFGRS galaxies to constrain the
amplitude of matter fluctuations. We find that the rms linear theory variance
in spheres of radius 8Mpc/h is \sigma_8 = 0.88^{+0.12}_{-0.10}, providing an
independent confirmation of values derived from other techniques. On non-linear
scales, where \xi>1, we find that Q_3 has a strong dependence on scale, colour
and luminosity.",2005-06-12T21:38:42Z
"Deep Echelle Spectrophotometry of S 311, a galactic H II Region Outside
  the Solar Circle","We present echelle spectrophotometry of the Galactic H II region S 311. The
data have been taken with the Very Large Telescope UVES echelle spectrograph in
the 3100 to 10400 angstroms range. We have measured the intensities of 263
emission lines, 178 are permitted lines of H0, D0 (deuterium), He0, C0, C+, N0,
N+, O0, O+, S+, Si0, Si+, Ar0 and Fe0; some of them are produced by
recombination and others mainly by fluorescence. Physical conditions have been
derived using different continuum and line intensity ratios. We have derived
He+, C++ and O++ ionic abundances from pure recombination lines as well as
abundances from collisionally excited lines for a large number of ions of
different elements. We have obtained consistent estimations of t2 applying
different methods. We have found that the temperature fluctuations paradigm is
consistent with the t2(He I) vs. t2(H I) relation for H II regions, in contrast
with what has been found for planetary nebulae. We report the detection of
deuterium Balmer lines up to D6 in the blue wings of the hydrogen lines, which
excitation mechanism seems to be continuum fluorescence.",2005-06-17T12:52:59Z
"The effect of grain size distribution on H$_2$ formation rate in the
  interstellar medium","The formation of molecular hydrogen in the interstellar medium takes place on
the surfaces of dust grains. Hydrogen molecules play a role in gas-phase
reactions that produce other molecules, some of which serve as coolants during
gravitational collapse and star formation. Thus, the evaluation of the
roduction rate of hydrogen molecules and its dependence on the physical
conditions in the cloud are of great importance. Interstellar dust grains
exhibit a broad size distribution in which the small grains capture most of the
surface area. Recent studies have shown that the production efficiency strongly
depends on the grain composition and temperature as well as on its size. In
this paper we present a formula which provides the total production rate of
H$_2$ per unit volume in the cloud, taking into account the grain composition
and temperature as well as the grain size distribution. The formula agrees very
well with the master equation results. It shows that for a physically relevant
range of grain temperatures, the production rate of H$_2$ is significantly
enhanced due to their broad size distribution.",2005-08-01T08:47:47Z
Unusual high-redshift radio BAL quasar 1624+3758,"We present observations of the most radio-luminous BAL quasar known,
1624+3758, at redshift z = 3.377. The quasar has several unusual properties:
(1) The FeII UV191 1787-A emission line is very prominent. (2) The BAL trough
(BALnicity index 2990 km/s) is detached by 21000 km/s and extends to velocity v
= -29000 km/s. There are additional intrinsic absorbers at -1900 and -2800
km/s. (3) The radio rotation measure of the quasar, 18350 rad/m^2, is the
second-highest known.
  The radio luminosity is P(1.4GHz) = 4.3 x 10^27 W/Hz (H0 = 50 km/s/Mpc, q0 =
0.5), radio loudness R* = 260. The radio source is compact (<~ 2.8 kpc) and the
radio spectrum is GHz-peaked, consistent with it being relatively young. The
width of the CIV emission line, in conjunction with the total optical
luminosity, implies black-hole mass ~ 10^9 M(sun), L/L(Eddington) ~ 2. The high
Eddington ratio, and the radio-loudness, place this quasar in one corner of
Boroson's (2002) 2-component scheme for the classification of AGN, implying a
very high accretion rate, and this may account for some of the unusual observed
properties.
  A complex mini-BAL absorber at v = -3000 km/s is detected in each of CIV, NV
and OVI. The blue and red components of the CIV doublet happen to be unblended,
allowing both the covering factor and optical depth to be determined as a
function of velocity. Variation of covering factor with velocity dominates the
form of the mini-BAL...",2005-04-22T15:29:33Z
Dark matter in the inner parts of barred galaxies: The data,"This paper presents surface photometry (B,V, I, J, H, K) and H_alpha rotation
curves of 27 isolated spiral galaxies. The final goal is to obtain the mass
distribution of a sample of isolated spiral galaxies in order to model their
gas kinematics. This is then compared to the observed rotation curve, to
determine the necessity of a dark halo in the inner parts (Perez et al. 2004).
The azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness profiles and the integrated
magnitudes obtained from ellipse fitting are given for each of the sample
galaxies. The ellipse fitting technique applied to the light distribution also
allowed us to obtain the size of the bar, and the inclination and position
angle of the outer isophotes that allow the galaxy deprojection. Using these
profiles, 1-D disk-bulge decomposition was performed to obtain the disk
scale-length and the bulge effective radius for the different bands. Through
the fitting of a parametric function to the observed rotation curve, the
maximum rotational velocity and the corresponding radius was obtained. The
correlation between the bulge and disk parameters is in agreement with previous
studies (de Jong 1996a; Marquez & Moles 1999; Baggett et al. 1998). Regarding
the Kormendy relation (Kormendy 1977), in agreement with de Jong, no
correlation between the bulge effective radius and its surface brightness is
found, possibly due to the small range of bulge magnitudes covered. We find a
smaller scatter in the structural relations when compared to non-isolated
samples in agreement with Marquez & Moles (1999). Finally, a correlation
between the disk scale-length and the bar size is observed, possibly reflecting
the rapid growth of a bar.",2005-05-31T17:04:22Z
Dark Matter and Stellar Mass in the Luminous Regions of Disk Galaxies,"We investigate the correlations among stellar mass (M_*), disk scale length
(R_d), and rotation velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths (V_2.2) for a sample of
81 disk-dominated galaxies (disk/total >= 0.9) selected from the SDSS. We
measure V_2.2 from long-slit H-alpha rotation curves and infer M_* from galaxy
i-band luminosities (L_i) and g-r colors. We find logarithmic slopes of
2.60+/-0.13 and 3.05+/-0.12 for the L_i-V_2.2 and M_*-V_2.2 relations, somewhat
shallower than most previous studies, with intrinsic scatter of 0.13 dex and
0.16 dex. Our direct estimates of the total-to-stellar mass ratio within
2.2R_d, assuming a Kroupa IMF, yield a median ratio of 2.4 for M_*>10^10 Msun
and 4.4 for M_*=10^9-10^10 Msun, with large scatter at a given M_* and R_d. The
typical ratio of the rotation speed predicted for the stellar disk alone to the
observed rotation speed at 2.2R_d is ~0.65. The distribution of R_d at fixed
M_* is broad, but we find no correlation between disk size and the residual
from the M_*-V_2.2 relation, implying that this relation is an approximately
edge-on view of the disk galaxy fundamental plane. Independent of the assumed
IMF, this result implies that stellar disks do not, on average, dominate the
mass within 2.2R_d. We discuss our results in the context of infall models of
disk formation in cold dark matter halos. A model with a disk-to-halo mass
ratio m_d=0.05 provides a reasonable match to the R_d-M_* distribution for spin
parameters \lambda ranging from ~0.04-0.08, and it yields a reasonable match to
the mean M_*-V_2.2 relation. A model with m_d=0.1 predicts overly strong
correlations between disk size and M_*-V_2.2 residual. Explaining the wide
range of halo-to-disk mass ratios within 2.2R_d requires significant scatter in
m_d values, with systematically lower m_d for galaxies with lower $M_*$.",2005-04-26T20:07:29Z
"Mapping the Kinematics of the Narrow-Line Region in the Seyfert Galaxy
  NGC 4151","Using The Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph HST's
STIS, observations of the OIII emission from the narrow-line region (NLR) of
NGC 4151 were obtained and radial velocities determined. Five orbits of HST
time were used to obtain spectra at five parallel slit configurations, at a
position angle of 58 degrees, with spatial resolution 0.2 arcseconds across and
0.1 arcseconds along each slit. A spectral resolving power of ~ 9,000 with the
G430M grating gave velocity measurements accurate to ~ 34 km/s. A kinematic
model was generated to match the radial velocities, for comparison to previous
kinematic models of biconical radial outflow developed for low-dispersion
spectra at two slit positions. The new high-resolution spectra permit the
measurement of accurate velocity dispersions for each radial-velocity
component. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) reaches a maximum of 1000 km/s
near the nucleus, and generally decreases with increasing distance to about 100
km/s in the extended narrow-line region (ENLR), starting at about 6 arcseconds
from the nucleus. In addition to the bright emission knots, which generally fit
our model, there are faint high velocity clouds which do not fit the biconical
outflow pattern of our kinematic model. These faint clouds occur at the
turnover points of the outflowing bright clouds. We suggest possible scenarios
that could explain these rogue clouds: (1) backflow resulting from shocks and
(2) outflow outside of the bicones, although the latter does not explain how
the knots are ionized and accelerated. A comparison of our observations with a
high-resolution radio map shows that there is no evidence that the kinematics
of the NLR clouds are affected by the radio lobes that comprise the inner jet.",2005-05-05T17:25:34Z
"Turbulent gas motions in galaxy cluster simulations: The role of SPH
  viscosity","Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) employs an artificial viscosity to
properly capture hydrodynamical shock waves. In its original formulation, the
resulting numerical viscosity is large enough to suppress structure in the
velocity field on scales well above the nominal resolution limit, and to damp
the generation of turbulence by fluid instabilities. This could artificially
suppress random gas motions in the intracluster medium (ICM), which are driven
by infalling structures during the hierarchical structure formation process. We
show that this is indeed the case by analysing results obtained with an SPH
formulation where an individual, time-variable viscosity is used for each
particle (Monaghan 1997). Using test calculations involving strong shocks, we
demonstrate that this scheme captures shocks as well as the original
formulation of SPH, but, in regions away from shocks, the numerical viscosity
is much smaller. In a set of nine high-resolution simulations of cosmological
galaxy cluster formation, we find that this low--viscosity formulation of SPH
produces substantially higher levels of turbulent gas motions in the ICM,
reaching a kinetic energy content in random gas motions (measured within a 1Mpc
cube) of up to 5%-30% of the thermal energy content, depending on cluster mass.
This has also significant effects on radial gas profile. We find a central
flattening of the entropy profile and a reduction of the central gas density in
the low--viscosity scheme. Interestingly, this tends to reduce the differences
seen in SPH and adaptive mesh refinement simulations of cluster formation.
Finally, invoking a model for particle acceleration by MHD waves driven by
turbulence, we find efficient electron acceleration to power diffuse radio
emission.",2005-07-20T15:36:00Z
"Upper limit on the primary photon fraction from the Pierre Auger
  Observatory","Based on observations of the depth of shower maximum performed with the
hybrid detector of the Auger Observatory, an upper limit on the cosmic-ray
photon fraction of 26% (at 95% confidence level) is derived for primary
energies above 10^19 eV. Additional observables recorded with the surface
detector array, available for a sub-set of the data sample, support the
conclusion that a photon origin of the observed events is not favoured.",2005-07-18T10:41:29Z
All-sky Relative Opacity Mapping Using Night Time Panoramic Images,"An all-sky cloud monitoring system that generates relative opacity maps over
many of the world's premier astronomical observatories is described.
Photometric measurements of numerous background stars are combined with
simultaneous sky brightness measurements to differentiate thin clouds from sky
glow sources such as air glow and zodiacal light. The system takes a continuous
pipeline of all-sky images, and compares them to canonical images taken on
other nights at the same sidereal time. Data interpolation then yields
transmission maps covering almost the entire sky. An implementation of this
system is currently operating through the Night Sky Live network of CONCAM3s
located at Cerro Pachon (Chile), Mauna Kea (Hawaii), Haleakala (Hawaii), SALT
(South Africa) and the Canary Islands (Northwestern Africa).",2005-06-15T19:35:57Z
Time variability of AGN and heating of cooling flows,"There is increasing evidence that AGN mechanical feedback is important in the
energetics of cooling flows in galaxies and galaxy clusters. We investigate the
implications of the variability of AGN mechanical luminosity L_m on
observations of cooling flows and radio galaxies in general. It is natural to
assume that l=ln(L_m/L_x) is a Gaussian process. Then L_m will be log-normally
distributed at fixed cooling luminosity L_x, and the variance in a measure of
L_m will increase with the time-resolution of the measure. We test the
consistency of these predictions with existing data. These tests hinge on the
power spectrum of l(t). Monitoring of Seyfert galaxies combined with estimates
of the duty cycle of quasars imply flicker noise spectra, similar to those of
microquasars. We combine a sample of sources in cooling flows that have
cavities with the assumption that the average mechanical luminosity of the AGN
equals L_x. Given that the mechanical luminosities are characterized by flicker
noise, we find that their spectral amplitudes lie between the estimated
amplitudes of quasars and the measured values for the radio luminosities of
microquasars. The model together with the observation that powerful radio
galaxies lie within a narrow range in optical luminosity, predicts the
luminosity function of radio galaxies, in agreement with observations.
Forthcoming radio surveys will test the prediction that the luminosity function
turns over at about the smallest luminosities so far probed. [Abridged]",2005-05-03T18:29:11Z
"On metal-deficient barium stars and their link with yellow symbiotic
  stars","This paper addresses the question of why metal-deficient barium stars are not
yellow symbiotic stars (YSyS). Samples of (suspected) metal-deficient barium
(mdBa) stars and YSyS have been collected from the literature, and their
properties reviewed. It appears in particular that the barium nature of the
suspected mdBa stars needs to be ascertained by detailed abundance analyses.
Abundances are therefore derived for two of them, HD 139409 and HD 148897,
which reveal that HD 148897 should not be considered a barium star. HD 139409
is a mild barium star, with overabundances observed only for elements belonging
to the first s-process peak (Y and Zr). The evidence for binarity among mdBa
stars is then reviewed, using three different methods: (i) radial-velocity
variations (from CORAVEL observations), (ii) Hipparcos astrometric data, and
(iii) a method based on the comparison between the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 proper
motions. A first-time orbit is obtained for HIP 55852, whereas evidence for the
(so far unknown) binary nature of HIP 34795, HIP 76605, HIP 97874 and HIP
107478 is presented. Two stars with no evidence for binarity whatsoever (HIP
58596 and BD +3 2688) are candidates low-metallicity thermally-pulsing
asymptotic giant branch stars, as inferred from their large luminosities. The
reason why mdBa stars are not YSyS is suggested to lie in their different
orbital period distributions: mdBa stars have on average longer orbital periods
than YSyS, and hence their companion accretes matter at a lower rate, for a
given mass loss rate of the giant star. The definite validation of this
explanation should nevertheless await the determination of the orbital periods
for the many mdBa stars still lacking periods, in order to make the comparison
more significant.",2005-06-24T13:00:39Z
Four new wide binaries among exoplanet host stars,"In our ongoing survey for wide (sub)stellar companions of exoplanet host
stars we have found 4 new co-moving stellar companions of the stars HD114729,
HD16141, HD196050 and HD213240 with projected separations from 223 up to
3898AU. The companionship of HD114729B, HD196050B and HD213240C is confirmed by
photometry and spectroscopy, all being early M dwarfs. The masses of the
detected companions are derived from their infrared JHK magnitudes and range
between 0.146 and 0.363 Msun. Our first and second epoch observations can rule
out additional stellar companions around the primaries from ~200 up to ~2400 AU
(S/N=10). In our survey we have found so far 6 new binaries among the exoplanet
host stars. According to these new detections, the reported differences between
single-star and binary-star planets with orbital periods short than 40 days
remain significant in both the mass-period and eccentricity-period
distribution. In contrast, all exoplanets with orbital periods longer than 100
days tend to display similar distributions.",2005-07-05T17:27:28Z
"The Radiative Transport of Dust in Primordial Galaxies and
  Second-Generation Star Formation","We investigate the radiative transport of dust in primordial galaxies in the
presence of the UV radiation field from the first metal-free stars. We find
that dust created in the first supernova (SN) explosions can be driven through
the interior of the SN remnant to accumulate in the SN shells, where
second-generation stars may form from compressed cooling gas. This scenario
requires metal-free stars to form continuously over timescales of up to 10 Myr,
consistent with recent estimates. Silicate and graphite grains, as well as
iron-bearing magnetites, are transported to the shells for reasonable parameter
assumptions, but their relative yields from primordial SNe is an important
factor in the resulting abundance ratios. We compare the results of segregated
grain transport with the current nucleosynthetic data on extremely metal-poor
Galactic halo stars. Fossil signatures of this process may already have been
detected in those iron-poor stars with enhanced carbon and silicate elements
such as magnesium, silicon and oxygen. We discuss the implications of our
results for the transition from first- to second-generation star formation in
primordial galaxies, and the role played by the radiative transport of dust in
this process.",2005-08-05T18:03:58Z
New constraints on MOND from galaxy clusters,"We revisit the application of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) to galaxy
clusters. We confront the high quality X-ray data for eight clusters of
galaxies observed by the \xmm satellite with the predictions of MOND. We obtain
a ratio of the MOND dynamical mass to the baryonic mass of $M_m/M_b=4.94\pm
0.50$ in the outer parts (i.e $r\sim 0.5$ ~ R$_{vir}$), in the concordance
cosmological model where the predicted asymptotic ratio, if any baryons are
present, is $7.7^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ (at $r\geq 0.3$ ~ R$_{vir}$). We confirm that
the MOND paradigm lowers the discrepancy between the binding mass and the
baryonic mass in clusters by a factor of $\sim 1.6$ at about half the virial
radius. However, at this radius about 80% of the mass is still missing, and as
pointed out by \citet{sanders03}, this necessitates a component of dark baryons
or neutrinos in the cluster core. Concerning the neutrino hypothesis,
application of the new data requires a minimum neutrino mass of $m_\nu>1.74\pm
0.34$ eV to fill this gap. The corresponding 2$\sigma$ lower limit of
$m_\nu>1.06$ eV is marginally inconsistent with the current constraints from
the cluster number counts, and from the CMB and large scale structure data.
MOND must invoke neutrinos to represent the main component that account for the
missing mass problem in clusters.",2005-05-02T10:15:31Z
Physical conditions in the Homunculus,"Conditions within the Homunculus nebula around Eta Car are determined by many
of the same physical processes that occur in molecular clouds in the
interstellar medium. But there is one major exception -- we know when the
ejection occurred and something about its composition and initial state. The
gas was warm, ionized, and dust-free when it was located within the star's
atmosphere and it is currently cold, molecular, and dusty. It undertook this
transformation in a bit over 150 years. It offers a laboratory for the study of
physical processes in a well-constrained environment. We derive a
photoionization model of the Homunculus nebula that reproduces many of its
observed properties. We conclude by outlining how observations of the
Homunculus could address basic problems in the physics of the interstellar
medium.",2005-03-29T21:20:26Z
Scalelengths in Dark Matter Halos,"We investigate a hypothesis regarding the origin of the scalelength in halos
formed in cosmological N-body simulations. This hypothesis can be viewed as an
extension of an earlier idea put forth by Merritt and Aguilar. Our findings
suggest that a phenomenon related to the radial orbit instability is present in
such halos and is responsible for density profile shapes. This instability sets
a scalelength at which the velocity dispersion distribution changes rapidly
from isotropic to radially anisotropic. This scalelength is reflected in the
density distribution as the radius at which the density profile changes slope.
We have tested the idea that radially dependent velocity dispersion anisotropy
leads to a break in density profile shape by manipulating the input of a
semi-analytic model to imitate the velocity structure imposed by the radial
orbit instability. Without such manipulation, halos formed are approximated by
single power-law density profiles and isotropic velocity distributions. Halos
formed with altered inputs display density distributions featuring scalelengths
and anisotropy profiles similar to those seen in cosmological N-body
simulations.",2005-08-05T15:39:27Z
A comparative analysis of empirical calibrators for nebular metallicity,"We present a new analysis of the main empirical calibrators of oxygen
abundance for ionised gas nebulae. With that aim we have compiled an extensive
sample of objects with emission line data including the near IR [SIII] lines
and the weak auroral lines which allow for the determination of the gas
electron temperature. For all the objects the oxygen abundances have been
derived in a homogeneus way, using the most recent sets of atomic coefficients
and taking into the account the effect of particle density on the temperature
of O$^+$. The residuals between directly and empirically-derived abundances as
a function of abundance have been studied. A grid of photo-ionisation models,
covering the range of physical properties of the gas, has been used to explain
the origin of the uncertainties affecting each abundance calibrator. The range
of validity for each abundance parameter has been identified and its average
uncertainty has been quantified.",2005-06-15T15:14:47Z
The SFH of the LMC: The CMD approach vs. integrated colors and spectra,"We present results of a study aiming at shedding light on the specific
advantages and limitations of methods to derive star formation histories (SFH)
in galaxies using resolved stellar populations and using integrated light,
respectively. For this purpose, we analyse the integrated-light spectrum of a
field in the LMC bar, for which highly resolved HST images are available as
well. To be compared with the SFH derived from the color magnitude diagram
(CMD) of this field (Smecker-Hane et al. 02), we have performed a set of
simulations of galaxies with systematically varying SFHs, but constant
metallicity (Z=0.008). We investigate to which extent different SF scenarios
can be discriminated on the basis of their photometric and spectral properties,
respectively, and determine in how far the detailed SFH obtained by the CMD
approach can be reproduced by results based upon integrated properties.
Comparing both methods for this nearby field we want to learn about the
specific character of both methods and understand to what precision SFHs can be
determined for distant galaxies only observable in integrated light. All
simulations are performed using our evolutionary synthesis code GALEV.",2005-07-12T21:15:58Z
"A Multi-Instrument Study of the Helix Nebula Knots with the Hubble Space
  Telescope","We have conducted a combined observational and theoretical investigation of
the ubiquitous knots in the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293). We have constructed a
combined hydrodynamic+radiation model for the ionized portion of these knots
and have accurately calculated a static model for their molecular regions.
Imaging observations in optical emission lines were made with the Hubble Space
Telescope's STIS spectrograph, operating in a ""slitless"" mode, complemented by
WFPC2 images in several of the same lines. The NICMOS camera was used to image
the knots in molecular hydrogen. These observations, when combined with other
studies of molecular hydrogen and CO provide a complete characterization of the
knots. They possess dense molecular cores of densities about 1,000,000 per
cubic centimeter surrounded on the central star side by a zone of hot molecular
hydrogen. The temperature of the molecular hydrogen emitting layer defies
explanation either through detailed calculations for radiative equilibrium or
for simplistic calculations for shock excitation. Further away from the core is
the ionized zone, whose peculiar distribution of emission lines is explained by
the expansion effects of material flowing through this region. The shadowed
region behind the core is the source of most of the CO emission from the knot
and is of the low temperature expected for a radiatively heated molecular
region.",2005-04-08T16:17:05Z
"MACHe3, a prototype for non-baryonic dark matter search: KeV event
  detection and multicell correlation","Superfluid He3 at ultra-low temperatures (100 microKelvins) is a sensitive
medium for the bolometric detection of particles. MACHe3 (MAtrix of Cells of
Helium 3) is a project for non-baryonic dark matter search using He3 as a
sensitive medium. Simulations made on a high granularity detector show a very
good rejection to background signals. A multicell prototype including 3
bolometers has been developed to allow correlations between the cells for
background event discrimination. One of the cells contains a low activity Co57
source providing conversion electrons of 7.3 and 13.6 keV to confirm the
detection of low energy events. First results on the multicell prototype are
presented. A detection threshold of 1 keV has been achieved. The detection of
low energy conversion electrons coming from the Co57 source is highlighted as
well as the cosmic muon spectrum measurement. The possibility to reject
background events by using the correlation among the cells is demonstrated from
the simultaneous detection of muons in different cells.",2005-04-28T13:11:14Z
The cosmic shear three-point functions,"We investigate the three-point functions of the weak lensing cosmic shear,
using both analytic methods and numerical results from N-body simulations. The
analytic model, an isolated dark matter halo with a powerlaw profile chosen to
fit the effective index at the scale probed, can be used to understand the
basic properties of the eight three-point functions observed in simulations. We
use this model to construct a single three-point function estimator that
""optimally"" combines the eight three-point functions. This new estimator is an
alternative to Map statistics and provides up to a factor of two improvement in
signal to noise compared to previously used combinations of cosmic shear
three-point functions.",2005-05-13T15:43:49Z
Time-Dependent MHD Shocks and Line Emission: The Case of the DG Tau Jet,"The line emission from a growing number of Herbig-Haro jets can be observed
and resolved at angular distances smaller than a few arcseconds from the
central source. The interpretation of this emission is problematic, since the
simplest model of a cooling jet cannot sustain it. It has been suggested that
what one actually observes are shocked regions with a filling factor of $\sim
1%$. In this framework, up to now, comparisons with observations have been
based on stationary shock models. Here we introduce for the first time the
self-consistent dynamics of such shocks and we show that considering their
properties at different times, i.e. locations, we can reproduce observational
data of the DG Tau microjet. In particular, we can interpret the spatial
behavior of the [SII]6716/6731 and [NII]/[OI]6583/6300 line intensity ratios
adopting a set of physical parameters that yield values of mass loss rates and
magnetic fields consistent with previous estimates. We also obtain the values
of the mean ionization fraction and electron density along the jet, compare
these values with the ones derived from observations using the sulfur doublet
to constrain the electron density (e.g. Bacciotti et al. 1995).",2005-07-12T14:30:13Z
"SnIa Constraints on the event-horizon Thermodynamical model of Dark
  Energy","We apply the thermodynamical model of the cosmological event horizon of the
spatially flat FLRW metrics to the study of the recent accelerated expansion
phase and to the coincidence problem. This model, called ""ehT model"" hereafter,
led to a dark energy (DE) density $\Lambda $ varying as $r^{-2},$ where $r$ is
the proper radius of the event horizon. Recently, another model motivated by
the holographic principle gave an independent justification of the same
relation between $\Lambda $ and $r$. We probe the theoretical results of the
ehT model with respect to the SnIa observations and we compare it to the model
deduced from the holographic principle, which we call ""LHG model"" in the
following.Our results are in excellent agreement with the observations for
$H\_{0}=64kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}$, and $\Omega \_{\Lambda

Gamma-Rays from Single Lobe Supernova Explosions,"Multi-dimensional simulations of the neutrino-driven mechanism behind
core-collapse supernovae have long shown that the explosions from this
mechanism would be asymmetric. Recently, detailed core-collapse simulations
have shown that the explosion may be strongest in a single direction. We
present a suite of simulations modeling these ``single-lobe'' supernova
explosions of a 15 solar mass red supergiant star, focusing on the effect these
asymmetries have on the gamma-ray emission and the mixing in the explosion. We
discuss how asymmetries in the explosion mechanism might explain many of the
observed ``asymmetries'' of supernovae, focusing on features of both supernova
1987A and the Cas A supernova remnant. In particular, we show that single-lobe
explosions provide a promising solution to the redshifted iron lines of
supernova 1987A. We also show that the extent of mixing for explosive burning
products depends sensitively on the angular profile of the velocity asymmetry
and can be much more extensive than previously assumed.",2005-07-27T20:47:51Z
"The Importance of Interactions for Mass Loss from Satellite Galaxies in
  Cold Dark Matter Haloes","We investigate the importance of interactions between dark matter
substructures for the mass loss they suffer whilst orbiting within a sample of
high resolution galaxy cluster mass Cold Dark Matter haloes formed in
cosmological N-body simulations. We have defined a quantitative measure that
gauges the degree to which interactions are responsible for mass loss from
substructures. This measure indicates that interactions are more prominent in
younger systems when compared to older more relaxed systems. We show that this
is due to the increased number of encounters a satellite experiences and a
higher mass fraction in satellites. This is in spite of the uniformity in the
distributions of relative distances and velocities of encounters between
substructures within the different host systems in our sample. Using a simple
model to relate the net force felt by a single satellite to the mass loss it
suffers, we show that interactions with other satellites account for ~30% of
the total mass loss experienced over its lifetime. The relation between the age
of the host and the importance of interactions increases the scatter about this
mean value from ~25% for the oldest to ~45% for the youngest system we have
studied. We conclude that satellite interactions play a vital role in the
evolution of substructure in dark matter halos and that a significant fraction
of the tidally stripped material can be attributed to these interactions.",2005-07-15T20:25:56Z
A Multi-wavelength study of the Pulsar PSR B1929+10 and its X-ray trail,"We report on the emission properties of PSR B1929+10 and its putative X-ray
trail from a multi-wavelength study performed with XMM-Newton, the ESO NTT, the
HST, the Effelsberg 100m Radio Telescope and the Jodrell Bank Radio
Observatory. The XMM-Newton observations confirm the existence of the diffuse
emission with a trail morphology lying in a direction opposite to the
transverse motion of the pulsar. The trail has a length of ~15 arcmin. Its
spectrum is non-thermal and produced by electron-synchrotron emission in the
shock between the pulsar wind and the surrounding medium. Assuming that the
electron lifetime against synchrotron cooling is comparable to the source
transit time over the X-ray trail length, the magnetic field strength in the
trail emitting region is inferred to be ~5 uG. Inspecting data from the
Effelsberg 11cm radio continuum survey of the Galactic plane we discovered an
elongated feature apparently coincident with the X-ray trail. The emission
properties observed from PSR 1929+10 are found to finally challenge the picture
of the emission properties of old non-recycled rotation powered pulsars. Both,
the temporal and spectral X-ray emission properties of PSR 1929+10 are in
excellent agreement with a non-thermal and, thus, magnetospheric radiation
dominated emission scenario. A flux contribution from the thermal emission of
heated polar caps of ~7% is inferred from a best fitting composite Planckian
and power law spectral model. The X-ray pulse profile is found to be markedly
different from the broad sinusoidal pulse profile seen in the low statistic
ROSAT data. Simulations in the framework of an outer-gap emission model are
able to reproduce the observed X-ray pulse profile and its phase relation
relative to the radio pulse.",2005-06-22T16:18:48Z
"Are rotation curves in NGC 6946 and the Milky Way magnetically
  supported?","Following the model of magnetically supported rotation of spiral galaxies,
the inner disk rotation is dominated by gravity but magnetism is not negligible
at radii where the rotation curve becomes flat, and indeed becomes dominant at
very large radii. Values of the order of 1 $\mu$G, or even less, produce a
centripetal force when the absolute value of the slope of the curve [$B_\phi$,
R] (azimuthal field strength versus radius) is less than $R^{-1}$. The
$R^{-1}$-profile is called the critical profile. From this hypothesis, the
following is to be expected: at large radii, a ``subcritical'' profile (slope
flatter than $R^{-1}$); at still larger radii a $B_\phi$-profile becoming
asymptotically critical as the density becomes asymptotically vanishing. Recent
observations of magnetic fields in NGC 6946 and the Milky Way are in very good
agreement with these predictions. This magnetic alternative requires neither
galactic dark matter (DM) nor modification of fundamental laws of physics, but
it is not in conflict with these hypotheses, especially with the existence of
cosmological cold dark matter (CDM).",2005-03-30T13:45:17Z
"First results from the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey: Constraints
  on the z=6 quasar luminosity function and the quasar contribution to
  reionization","We present preliminary results of a new quasar survey being undertaken with
multi-colour optical imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The
current data consists of 3.83 sq. deg. of imaging in the i' and z' filters to a
10 sigma limit of z'<23.35. Near-infrared photometry of 24 candidate 5.7<z<6.4
quasars confirms them all to be low mass stars including two T dwarfs and four
or five L dwarfs. Photometric estimates of the spectral type of the two T
dwarfs are T3 and T6. We use the lack of high-redshift quasars in this survey
volume to constrain the z=6 quasar luminosity function. For reasonable values
of the break absolute magnitude M*_1450 and faint-end slope alpha, we determine
that the bright-end slope beta>-3.2 at 95% confidence. We find that the
comoving space-density of quasars brighter than M_1450=-23.5 declines by a
factor >25 from z=2 to z=6, mirroring the decline observed for high-luminosity
quasars. We consider the contribution of the quasar population to the ionizing
photon density at z=6 and the implications for reionization. We show that the
current constraints on the quasar population give an ionizing photon density
<<30% that of the star-forming galaxy population. We conclude that active
galactic nuclei make a negligible contribution to the reionization of hydrogen
at z~6.",2005-07-07T20:22:17Z
"X-ray Cluster Associated with the z=1.063 CSS Quasar 3C 186: The Jet is
  NOT Frustrated","We report the Chandra discovery of an X-ray cluster at redshift z = 1.063
associated with the Compact Steep Spectrum radio loud quasar 3C 186
(Q0740+380). Diffuse X-ray emission is detected out to ~120 kpc from the quasar
and contains 741+/-40 net counts. The X-ray spectrum of the extended emission
shows strong Fe-line emission (EW=412eV) at the quasar redshift and confirms
the thermal nature of this diffuse component. We measure a cluster temperature
of 5.2(+1.2/-0.9) keV and an X-ray luminosity L(0.5-2 keV) ~ 6e44 erg/sec,
which are in agreement with the luminosity-temperature relation for
high-redshift clusters. This is the first detection of a bright X-ray cluster
around a luminous (L_bol ~1e47 erg/sec) CSS quasar at high redshift and only
the fifth z>1 X-ray cluster detected. We find that the CSS radio source is
highly overpressured with respect to the thermal cluster medium by about 3
orders of magnitude. This provides direct observational evidence that the radio
source is not thermally confined as posited in the ``frustrated'' scenario for
CSS sources. Instead, it appears that the radio source may be young and we are
observing it at an early stage of its evolution. In that case the radio source
could supply the energy into the cluster and potentially prevent its cooling.",2005-06-16T19:08:44Z
"Photospheric phosphorus in the FUSE spectra of GD71 and two similar DA
  white dwarfs","We report the detection, from FUSE data, of phosphorus in the atmospheres of
GD71 and two similar DA white dwarfs. This is the first detection of a trace
metal in the photosphere of the spectrophotometric standard star GD71.
Collectively, these objects represent the coolest DA white dwarfs in which
photospheric phosphorus has been observed. We use a grid of homogeneous non-LTE
synthetic spectra to measure abundances of[P/H]=-8.57 +0.09 -0.13, -8.70 +0.23
-0.37 and -8.36 +0.14 -0.19 in GD71, RE J1918+595 and RE J0605-482
respectively. At the observed level we find phosphorus has no significant
impact on the overall energy distribution of GD71. We explore possible
mechanisms responsible for the presence of this element in these stars,
concluding that the most likely is an interplay between radiative levitation
and gravitational settling but possibly modified by weak mass loss.",2005-07-27T14:38:42Z
"Spectral and morphological properties of quasar hosts in SPH simulations
  of AGN feeding by mergers","We present a method for generating virtual observations from
smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. This method includes stellar
population synthesis models and the reprocessing of starlight by dust to
produce realistic galaxy images. We apply this method and simulate the merging
of two identical giant Sa galaxies. The merger remnant is an elliptical galaxy.
The merger concentrates the gas content of the two galaxies into the nuclear
region. The gas that flows into the nuclear region refuels the central black
holes of the merging galaxies. We follow the refuelling of the black holes
during the merger semi-analytically.
  In the simulation presented in this article, the black holes grow from 3 x
10^7 to 1.8X 10^8 Solar masses, with a peak AGN luminosity of M_B ~ -23.7. We
study how the morphological and spectral properties of the system evolve during
the merger and work out the predictions of this scenario for the properties of
host galaxies during the active phase. The peak of AGN activity coincides with
the merging of the two galactic nuclei and occurs at a stage when the remnant
looks like a lenticular galaxy. The simulation predicts the formation of a
circumnuclear starburst ring/dusty torus with an opening angle of 30-40 degrees
and made of clouds with n_H=10^24 cm^-2. The average optical depth of the torus
is quite high, but the obscuring medium is patchy, so that there still exist
lines of sight where the AGN is visible in a nearly edge-on view. For the same
reason, there are lines of sight where the AGN is completely obscured in the
face-on view.",2005-04-18T18:39:01Z
"Superhumps in Cataclysmic Binaries. XXV. q_crit, epsilon(q), and
  Mass-Radius","We report on successes and failures in searching for positive superhumps in
cataclysmic variables, and show the superhumping fraction as a function of
orbital period. Basically, all short-period systems do, all long-period systems
don't, and a 50% success rate is found at P_orb=3.1+-0.2 hr. We can use this to
measure the critical mass ratio for the creation of superhumps. With a
mass-radius relation appropriate for cataclysmic variables, and an assumed mean
white-dwarf mass of 0.75 M_sol, we find a mass ratio q_crit=0.35+-0.02.
  We also report superhump studies of several stars of independently known mass
ratio: OU Virginis, XZ Eridani, UU Aquarii, and KV UMa (= XTE J1118+480). The
latter two are of special interest, because they represent the most extreme
mass ratios for which accurate superhump measurements have been made. We use
these to improve the epsilon(q) calibration, by which we can infer the elusive
q from the easy-to-measure epsilon (the fractional period excess of P_superhump
over P_orb). This relation allows mass and radius estimates for the secondary
star in any CV showing superhumps. The consequent mass-radius law shows an
apparent discontinuity in radius near 0.2 M_sol, as predicted by the disrupted
magnetic braking model for the 2.1-2.7 hour period gap. This is effectively the
""empirical main sequence"" for CV secondaries.",2005-07-15T12:32:02Z
Observing the Seyfert 2 nucleus of NGC 1068 with the VLT Interferometer,"Dusty tori have been suggested to play a crucial role in determining the
physical characteristics of active galactic nuclei (AGN), but investigation of
their properties has stalled for lack of high resolution mid-IR imaging.
Recently, a long-awaited breakthrough in this field was achieved: NGC 1068, a
nearby AGN, was the first extragalactic object to be observed with a mid-IR
interferometer, thereby obtaining the needed angular resolution to study the
alleged torus.
  In this proceeding, first the field of AGN research is briefly reviewed, with
an emphasis on models of dusty tori. Second, the general properties of the key
object NGC 1068 are discussed. Third, the MIDI mid-IR interferometric data set
is presented together with a first attempt to interpret this data in the
context of tori models. Fourth, preliminary MIDI interferometric spectra of the
nucleus of the nearby starbursting galaxy Circinus are presented. Finally, we
briefly discuss the prospects of ESA's Darwin mission for observing nearby and
distant AGN. This mission will allow detailed mapping of tori of low luminosity
AGN such as NGC 1068 up to redshifts of 1 - 2 and more luminous AGN up to
redshift of 10 and beyond (abridged).",2005-07-10T18:38:57Z
Stellar populations and Lya emission in two lensed z>~6 galaxies,"We present an analysis of two strongly lensed galaxies at z=6.56 and z ~ 7
for which multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations are available.
For one source the data include recent HST and Spitzer observations. Using an
SED fitting technique considering a number of parameters we attempt to
constrain the properties of their stellar populations and their intrinsic Lya
emission. The following main results are obtained for the individual galaxies:
* Triple arc in Abell 2218: The most likely redshift of this source is z ~
6.0-7.2. SED fits indicate generally a low extinction but do not strongly
constrain the star formation (SF) history. Best fits have typical ages of ~3 to
400 Myr. The apparent 4000Ang break observed recently from combination of
IRAC/Spitzer and HST observations, can also equally well be reproduced with the
template of a young (~3-5 Myr). The estimated SFR is typically ~1 Msun/yr, in
agreement with previous estimates. The unknowns on the age and star formation
history could easily explain the apparent absence of Lya in this galaxy. *
Abell 370 HCM 6A: The available Lya and continuum observations indicate two
possible solutions: 1) a young burst or ongoing constant SF with non-negligible
extinction or 2) a composite young+""old"" stellar population. In the first case
one obtains a best fit A_V ~ 0.5-1.8 at a 1 sigma level. In consequence we
obtain SFR ~ 11-41 Msun/yr, higher than earlier estimates, and we estimate a
fairly high total luminosity (L ~ (1-4)*10^{11} Lsun) for this galaxy, in the
range LIRG. A Lya transmission of ~23-90% is estimated from our best fit
models. Other properties remain largely unconstrained. In case of composite
stellar populations the SFR, mass, and luminosity estimate is lower. The two
scenarios may be distinguishable with IRAC/Spitzer observations at 3.6 and 4.5
micron.",2005-06-28T07:53:58Z
Kuiper Binary Object Formation,"It has been observed that binary Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) exist contrary to
theoretical expectations. Their creation presents problems to most current
models. However, the inclusion of a third body (for example, one of the outer
planets) may provide the conditions necessary for the formation of these
objects. The presence of a third massive body not only helps to clear the
primordial Kuiper Belt but can also result in long lived binary Kuiper belt
objects. The gravitational interaction between the KBOs and the third body
causes one of four effects; scattering into the Oort cloud, collisions with the
growing protoplanets, formation of binary pairs, or creation of a single Kuiper
belt object. Additionally, the initial location of the progenitors of the
Kuiper belt objects also has a significant effect on binary formation.",2005-07-06T20:27:22Z
Exploring Terrestrial Planet Formation in the TW Hydrae Association,"Spitzer Space Telescope infrared measurements are presented for 24 members of
the TW Hydrae association (TWA). High signal-to-noise 24-micron (um) photometry
is presented for all of these stars, including 20 stars that were not detected
by IRAS. Among these 20 stars, only a single object, TWA 7, shows excess
emission at 24um and at the level of only 40% above the star's photosphere. TWA
7 also exhibits a strong 70um excess that is a factor of 40 brighter than the
stellar photosphere at this wavelength. At 70um, an excess of similar magnitude
is detected for TWA 13, though no 24um excess was detected for this binary. For
the 18 stars that failed to show measurable IR excesses, the sensitivity of the
current 70um observations does not rule out substantial cool excesses at levels
10-40x above their stellar continua. Measurements of two T Tauri stars, TW Hya
and Hen 6-300, confirm that their spectacular IR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) do not turn over even by 160um, consistent with the expectation for
their active accretion disks. In contrast, the Spitzer data for the luminous
planetary debris systems in the TWA, HD 98800B and HR 4796A, are consistent
with single-temperature blackbody SEDs. The major new result of this study is
the dramatic bimodal distribution found for the association in the form of
excess emission at a wavelength of 24um, indicating negligible amounts of warm
(>100 K) dust and debris around 20 of 24 stars in this group of very young
stars. This bimodal distribution is especially striking given that the four
stars in the association with strong IR excesses are >100x brighter at 24um
than their photospheres.",2005-06-13T20:49:32Z
Search for Pulsed VHE gamma-ray Emission from Young Pulsars with H.E.S.S,"Pulsars are commonly regarded as highly magnetized neutron stars, rotating up
to several hundred times per second. Over 1,500 radio pulsars have been found
so far, about 70 of which are X-ray pulsars, but only a handful have been
observed in gamma rays. This high-energy emission is believed to be produced by
the electrons accelerated to TeV energies in the pulsar magnetosphere,
resulting in cascades of secondary particles. The H.E.S.S. experiment is a
system of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia, which is
sensitive to gamma rays above 100 GeV. Three young pulsars, Crab, Vela, and PSR
B1706-44 have been observed with H.E.S.S. The results of the search for pulsed
emission for these targets, and the constraints on the theories of pulsed very
high energy gamma-ray emission, are summarized here.",2005-07-17T05:54:18Z
"Measurement of the Energy Release Rate and the Reconnection Rate in
  Solar Flares","By using the method presented by Isobe et al. (2002), the non-dimensional
reconnection rate Vin/Va has been determined for the impulsive phase of three
two-ribbon flares, where Vin is the velocity of the reconnection inflow and Va
is the Alfven velocity. The non-dimensional reconnection rate is important to
make a constraint on the theoretical models of magnetic reconnection. In order
to reduce the uncertainty of the reconnection rate, it is important to
determine the energy release rate of the flares from observational data as
accurately as possible. To this end, we have carried out one dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of a flare loop and synthesized the count rate
detected by the soft X-ray telescope (SXT) aboard Yohkoh satellite. We found
that the time derivative of the thermal energy contents in a flare arcade
derived from SXT data is smaller than the real energy release rate by a factor
of 0.3 - 0.8, depending on the loop length and the energy release rate. The
result of simulation is presented in the paper and used to calculate the
reconnection rate. We found that reconnection rate is 0.047 for the X2.3 flare
on 2000 November 24, 0.015 for the M3.7 flare on 2000 July 14, and 0.071 for
the C8.9 flare on 2000 November 16. These values are similar to that derived
from the direct observation of the reconnection inflow by Yokoyama et al.
(2001), and consistent with the fast reconnection models such as that of
Petschek (1964).",2005-07-13T16:42:05Z
"An Analysis of the Shapes of Ultraviolet Extinction Curves. IV.
  Extinction without Standards","We present a new method for deriving UV-through-IR extinction curves, based
on the use of stellar atmosphere models to provide estimates of the intrinsic
(i.e., unreddened) stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs), rather than
unreddened (or lightly reddened) standard stars. We show that this
``extinction-without-standards'' technique greatly increases the accuracy of
the derived extinction curves and allows realistic estimations of the
uncertainties. An additional benefit of the technique is that it simultaneously
determines the fundamental properties of the reddened stars themselves, making
the procedure valuable for both stellar and interstellar studies. We
demonstrate how the extinction-without-standards curves make it possible to: 1)
study the uniformity of extinction in localized spatial regions with
unprecedented precision; 2) determine the relationships between different
aspects of curve morphology; 3) produce high quality extinction curves from low
color excess sightlines; and 4) derive reliable extinction curves for mid-late
B stars, thereby increasing spatial coverage and allowing the study of
extinction in open clusters and associations dominated by such stars. The
application of this technique to the available database of UV-through-IR SEDs,
and to future observations, will provide valuable constraints on the nature of
interstellar grains and on the processes which modify them, and will enhance
our ability to remove the multi-wavelength effects of extinction from
astronomical energy distributions.",2005-06-17T15:21:28Z
Recovering Solar Toroidal Field Dynamics From Sunspot Location Patterns,"We analyze both Kitt Peak magnetogram data and MDI continuum intensity
sunspot data to search for the following solar toroidal band properties: width
in latitude and the existence of a tipping instability (longitudinal m=1 mode)
for any time during the solar cycle. To determine the extent which we can
recover the toroidal field dynamics, we forward model artificially generated
sunspot distributions from subsurface toroidal fields we assigned certain
properties. We analyzed two sunspot distribution parameters using MDI and model
data: the average latitudinal separation of sunspot pairs as a function of
longitudinal separation, and the number of sunspot pairs creating a given angle
with respect to the E-W direction. A toroidal band of 10 degrees width with a
constant tipping of 5 degrees best fits MDI data early in the solar cycle. A
toroidal band of 20 degrees width with a tipping amplitude decreasing in time
from 5 to 0 degrees best fits MDI data late in the solar cycle. Model data
generated by untipped toroidal bands cannot fit MDI high latitude data and can
fit only one parameter at low latitudes. Tipped toroidal bands satisfy chi
squared criteria at both high and low latitudes. We conclude this is evidence
to reject the null hypothesis - that toroidal bands in the solar tachocline do
not experience a tipping instability - in favor of the hypothesis that the
toroidal band experiences an m=1 tipping instability. Our finding that the band
widens from ~10 degrees early in the solar cycle to ~20 degrees late in the
solar cycle may be explained in theory by magnetic drag spreading the toroidal
band due to altered flow along the tipped field lines.",2005-06-01T18:16:18Z
"Fourier Transform Spectroscopy of the submillimetre continuum emission
  from hot molecular cores","We have used a Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope to study the submillimetre continuum emission from dust in three hot
molecular cores (HMC). The spectral index beta of the dust emission for these
sources has been determined solely within the 30 GHz wide 350 GHz (850 micron)
passband to an accuracy comparable to those determined through multi-wavelength
observations. We find an average beta = 1.6, in agreement with spectral indices
determined from previous submillimetre observations of these sources and with
those determined for HMC in general. The largest single source of uncertainty
in these results is the variability of the atmosphere at 350 GHz, and with
better sky subtraction techniques we show that the dust spectral index can
clearly be determined within one passband to high accuracy with a submillimetre
FTS. Using an imaging FTS on SCUBA-2, the next generation wide-field
submillimetre camera currently under development to replace SCUBA at the JCMT
in 2006, we calculate that at 350 GHz it will be possible to determine beta to
+/- 0.1 for sources as faint as 400 mJy/beam and to +/- 0.3 for sources as
faint as 140 mJy/beam.",2005-05-16T21:23:24Z
"Halpha-Derived Star-Formation Rates For Three z ~ 0.75 EDisCS Galaxy
  Clusters","We present Halpha-derived star-formation rates (SFRs) for three z ~ 0.75
galaxy clusters. Our 1 sigma flux limit corresponds to a star-formation rate of
0.10-0.24 solar mass per year, and our minimum reliable Halpha + [N II]
rest-frame equivalent width is 10\AA. We show that Halpha narrowband imaging is
an efficient method for measuring star formation in distant clusters. In two
out of three clusters, we find that the fraction of star-forming galaxies
increases with projected distance from the cluster center. We also find that
the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with increasing local galaxy
surface density in the same two clusters. We compare the median rate of star
formation among star-forming cluster galaxies to a small sample of star-forming
field galaxies from the literature and find that the median cluster SFRs are
\~50% less than the median field SFR. We characterize cluster evolution in
terms of the mass-normalized integrated cluster SFR and find that the z ~ 0.75
clusters have more SFR per cluster mass on average than the z <= 0.4 clusters
from the literature. The interpretation of this result is complicated by the
dependence of the mass-normalized SFR on cluster mass and the lack of
sufficient overlap in the mass ranges covered by the low and high redshift
samples. We find that the fraction and luminosities of the brightest starburst
galaxies at z ~ 0.75 are consistent with their being progenitors of the
post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0.45 if the post-starburst phase lasts several
(~5) times longer than the starburst phase.",2005-04-26T18:26:56Z
"Towards a physical model of dust tori in Active Galactic Nuclei -
  Radiative transfer calculations for a hydrostatic torus model","We explore physically self-consistent models of dusty molecular tori in
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the goal of interpreting VLTI observations
and fitting high resolution mid-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The
input dust distribution is analytically calculated by assuming hydrostatic
equilibrium between pressure forces - due to the turbulent motion of the gas
clouds - and gravitational and centrifugal forces as a result of the
contribution of the nuclear stellar distribution and the central black hole.
For a fully three-dimensional treatment of the radiative transfer problem
through the tori we employ the Monte Carlo code MC3D. We find that in
homogeneous dust distributions the observed mid-infrared emission is dominated
by the inner funnel of the torus, even when observing along the equatorial
plane. Therefore, the stratification of the distribution of dust grains - both
in terms of size and composition - cannot be neglected. In the current study we
only include the effect of different sublimation radii which significantly
alters the SED in comparison to models that assume an average dust grain
property with a common sublimation radius, and suppresses the silicate emission
feature at 9.7 micron. In this way we are able to fit the mean SED of both type
I and type II AGN very well. Our fit of special objects for which high angular
resolution observations (less than 0.3 arcseconds) are available indicates that
the hottest dust in NGC 1068 reaches the sublimation temperature while the
maximum dust temperature in the low-luminosity AGN Circinus falls short of 1000
K.",2005-04-05T12:23:04Z
Evidence of a counterrotating core in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"Stellar radial velocity in the central region of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) is used to estimate the radial velocity curve along various position
angles (PA) including the line of nodes (LON). The central part of the radial
velocity profile, along the LON, shows a V-shaped profile - a clear indication
of counterrotation. The counterrotating region and the secondary bar have
similar location and PA. The origin of the counter-rotating core could be
internal(secondary bar) or external(accretion). To explain the observed
velocity profile, we propose the existence of two disks in the inner LMC, with
one counterrotating. This two disk model is found to match the HI velocities as
well. Two disks with different LON and velocity profiles can create regions
which are kinematically and spatially separated. Predicted such locations are
found to match the observed locations where the HI clouds are found to have two
velocities.",2005-03-29T04:18:12Z
"Regularized orbit models unveiling the stellar structure and dark matter
  halo of the Coma elliptical NGC 4807","This is the second in a series of papers dedicated to unveil the mass
structure and orbital content of a sample of flattened early-type galaxies in
the Coma cluster. The ability of our orbit libraries to reconstruct internal
stellar motions and the mass composition of a typical elliptical in the sample
is investigated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations of isotropic rotator
models. The simulations allow a determination of the optimal amount of
regularization needed in the orbit superpositions. It is shown that under
realistic observational conditions and with the appropriate regularization
internal velocity moments can be reconstructed to an accuracy of about 15 per
cent; the same accuracy can be achieved for the circular velocity and dark
matter fraction. In contrast, the flattening of the halo remains unconstrained.
Regularized orbit superpositions are applied to a first galaxy in our sample,
NGC 4807, for which stellar kinematical observations extend to 3 Reff. The
galaxy seems dark matter dominated outside 2 Reff. Logarithmic dark matter
potentials are consistent with the data, as well as NFW-profiles, mimicking
logarithmic potentials over the observationally sampled radial range. In both
cases, the derived stellar mass-to-light ratio agrees well with independently
obtained mass-to-light ratios from stellar population analysis. Kinematically,
NGC 4807 is characterized by mild radial anisotropy outside r>0.5 Reff,
becoming isotropic towards the center. Our orbit models hint at either a
distinct stellar component or weak triaxiality in the outer parts of the
galaxy.",2005-04-21T13:26:53Z
The infrared Hourglass cluster in M8,"A detailed study of the Hourglass Nebula in the M8 star forming region is
presented. The study is mainly based on recent subarcsec-resolution JHKs images
taken at Las Campanas Observatory and complemented with archival HST images and
longslit spectroscopy retrieved from the ESO Archive Facility. Using the new
numerical code CHORIZOS, we estimate the distance to the earliest stars in the
region to be 1.25 kpc. Infrared photometry of all the sources detected in the
field is given. From analysis of the JHKs colour-colour diagrams, we find that
an important fraction of these sources exhibit significant infrared excess.
These objects are candidates to be low- and intermediate-mass pre-main sequence
stars. Based on HST observations, the spatial distribution of gas, dust and
stars in the region is analyzed. The morphological analysis of these images
also reveals a rich variety of structures related to star formation (proplyds,
jets, bow shocks), similar to those observed in M16 and M42, along with the
detection of the first four Herbig-Haro objects in the region. Furthermore, a
longslit spectrum obtained with NTT confirms the identification of one of them
(HH 870) in the core of the Hourglass nebula, providing the first direct
evidence of active star formation by accretion in M8.",2005-06-22T23:53:25Z
"Depolarization of radio bursts due to reflection off sharp boundaries in
  the solar corona","It is argued that depolarization of solar radio bursts requires reflection
off boundary layers no thicker than about a wavelength (a few meters at most)
between regions with large density ratios. The implied inhomogeneities suggest
that the corona is much more highly and sharply structured than can be resolved
from observations at other wavelengths. A simplified version of magnetoionic
theory is used to derive a depolarization coefficient: the effect of the
magnetic field is ignored in treating the dispersion, but taken into account in
treating the (circular) polarization. Plots of the depolarization coefficient
are used to infer conditions under which effective depolarization occurs, and
it is concluded that favorable conditions require total internal reflection.
For type I sources away from the central meridian, effective depolarization
requires reflection off an overdense structure with a density ratio
$\xi\approx10$. For type III bursts, a density ratio $\xi\approx2$ suffices,
with at least two reflections off walls of ducts at $\approx20^\circ$ to the
radial.",2005-07-22T05:51:58Z
"Detectable neutrino fluxes due to enhanced cosmic ray densities in the
  Galactic Center region","We examine in detail the detectability of a signal of diffuse high energy
neutrinos produced in the Milky Way by the interaction of cosmic rays (CRs)
with the interstellar medium (ISM). We show that highly inhomogeneous galactic
CR densities arise naturally from large scale drift effects and the
inhomogeneous distribution of CR sources. In particular, the CR density in the
Galactic Center region (where the ISM density is maximal) could be an order of
magnitude larger than the local CR density. Hence, the expected diffuse flux of
neutrinos from the Galactic Center region becomes enhanced and could be
detected at energies above $\sim 10^4$ GeV in a km$^3$-size neutrino telescope
within 10 years of operation. The galactic anisotropy, which is the main
signature of this flux, allows to discriminate this signal from other possible
extraterrestrial diffuse fluxes of high energy neutrinos.",2005-05-17T12:00:29Z
"Gravitational waves, inflation and the cosmic microwave background:
  towards testing the slow-roll paradigm","One of the fundamental and yet untested predictions of inflationary models is
the generation of a very weak cosmic background of gravitational radiation. We
investigate the sensitivity required for a space-based gravitational wave laser
interferometer with peak sensitivity at $\sim 1$ Hz to observe such signal as a
function of the model parameters and compare it with indirect limits that can
be set with data from present and future cosmic microwave background missions.
We concentrate on signals predicted by slow-roll single field inflationary
models and instrumental configurations such as those proposed for the LISA
follow-on mission: Big Bang Observer.",2005-04-13T10:44:53Z
Dust Emission by AGN and Starbursts,"Present AGN and starburst models aiming to account for the observed infrared
SEDs consider a physical description of the dust and a solution of the
radiative transfer problem. MIR spectra obtained at different spatial scales
(SST-IRS, ISO and TIMMI2) are presented. They show that PAH bands are detected
in starburst regions but significantly reduced near the centre of AGN. This is
explained by examining the heating mechanism of PAHs after hard (FUV, X-ray)
photon interactions. Economic radiative transfer models of starbursts and AGN
are made available. The successful application of the starburst model is
demonstrated by fitting broad band data and detailed Spitzer spectra of
NGC7714. The AGN model is applied to ISO data of a sample of 68 radio galaxies
and quasars of the 3CR catalogue. Radiative transfer models of galaxies with
Hidden Broad Line Regions are shown. Their SED enable us to separate the
contributions from the dusty disc of the AGN and the starbursts. The composite
model is consistent with the unified scheme and the idea that the infrared
emission of AGN is dominated in the MIR and starbursts in the FIR. According to
the unified scheme, the observed diversity of AGN properties results from the
different orientations relative to our line of sight. The strong resonance of
silicate dust at 10mic is therefore, as expected, seen in absorption towards
many type-2 AGN. In type-1 AGN, it should be seen in emission because the hot
inner surface of the dust torus becomes visible. However, this has not been
observed so far, thus challenging the unification scheme or leading to exotic
modifications of the dust-torus model. Here the recent discovery of the 10mic
silicate feature in emission in luminous quasar spectra is reported.",2005-06-24T08:48:51Z
Star Formation in HI Selected Galaxies. II. HII Region Properties,"A sample of 69 galaxies with radial velocities less than 2500 km/s was
selected from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) to deduce details about
star formation in nearby disk galaxies selected with no bias to optical surface
brightness selection effects. Broad (B and R) and narrow band (H-alpha) images
were obtained for all of these objects. More than half of the sample galaxies
are late-type, dwarf disks (mostly Sc and Sm galaxies). We have measured the
properties of the HII regions on H-alpha, continuum subtracted images, using
the HIIphot package developed by Thilker et al. 2000. All but one of the
galaxies contained at least one detectable HII region. Examination of the
properties of the HII regions in each galaxy revealed that the brightest
regions in higher surface brightness galaxies tend to be more luminous than
those in lower surface brightness galaxies. A higher fraction (referred to as
the diffuse fraction) of the H-alpha emission from lower surface brightness
galaxies comes from diffuse ionized gas (DIG). HII region luminosity functions
(LFs) co-added according to surface brightness show that the shapes of the LFs
for the lowest surface brightness galaxies are different from those for typical
spiral galaxies. This discrepancy could be caused by the lowest surface
brightness galaxies having somewhat episodic star formation or by them forming
a relatively larger fraction of their stars outside of dense, massive molecular
clouds. In general, the results imply that the conditions under which star
formation occurs in lower surface brightness galaxies are different than in
more typical, higher surface brightness spiral galaxies.",2005-06-01T23:56:34Z
X-ray properties of active M dwarfs as observed by XMM-Newton,"We present a comparative study of X-ray emission from a sample of active M
dwarfs with spectral types \hbox{M3.5 - M4.5} using XMM-Newton observations of
two single stars, AD Leonis and EV Lacertae, and two unresolved binary systems,
AT Microscopii and EQ Pegasi. The light curves reveal frequent flaring during
all four observations. We perform a uniform spectral analysis and determine
plasma temperatures, abundances and emission measures in different states of
activity. Applying multi-temperature models with variable abundances separately
to data obtained with the EPIC and RGS detectors we are able to investigate the
consistency of the results obtained by the different instruments onboard
XMM-Newton. We find that the X-ray properties of the sample M dwarfs are very
similar, with the coronal abundances of all sample stars following a trend of
increasing abundance with increasing first ionization potential, the inverse
FIP effect. The overall metallicities are below solar photospheric ones but
appear consistent with the measured photospheric abundances of M dwarfs like
these. A significant increase in the prominence of the hotter plasma components
is observed during flares while the cool plasma component is only marginally
affected by flaring, pointing to different coronal structures. AT Mic, probably
a young pre-main-sequence system, has the highest X-ray luminosity and exhibits
also the hottest corona. While results of EQ Peg and EV Lac are presented here
for the first time, AT Mic and AD Leo have been investigated before with
different analysis approaches, allowing a comparison of the results.",2005-04-06T12:01:56Z
Soft Gamma-Ray Bursts in the BATSE data,"We performed the scan of the BATSE DISCLA records inspecting 25-50 keV range
to pick up soft GRBs. We applied the same technique as in our previous (Stern
et al. 2001) scan in the 50-300 keV range. We scanned about 1.8 year of the
data and found 30 new gamma-ray burst (GRB)s. The total number of soft GRBs in
the BATSE data, with the count rate in the 25-50 keV range higher than in the
50-300 keV range, is only 4%. There are about two extremely soft events per
year which are invisible about 50 keV and which could constitute a new class of
events separate from the GRB phenomenon. We also show that X-ray flashes (XRFs)
detected by BeppoSAX have a hardness ratio very similar to that of normal GRBs,
supporting a view that XRFs and GRBs are a single phenomenon with a wide
spectral variety.",2005-05-24T13:39:17Z
"Particle Acceleration and the Production of Relativistic Outflows in
  Advection-Dominated Accretion Disks with Shocks","Relativistic outflows (jets) of matter are commonly observed from systems
containing black holes. The strongest outflows occur in the radio-loud systems,
in which the accretion disk is likely to have an advection-dominated structure.
In these systems, it is clear that the binding energy of the accreting gas is
emitted primarily in the form of particles rather than radiation. However, no
comprehensive model for the disk structure and the associated outflows has yet
been produced. In particular, none of the existing models establishes a direct
physical connection between the presence of the outflows and the action of a
microphysical acceleration mechanism operating in the disk. In this paper we
explore the possibility that the relativistic protons powering the jet are
accelerated at a standing, centrifugally-supported shock in the underlying
accretion disk via the first-order Fermi mechanism. The theoretical analysis
employed here parallels the early studies of cosmic-ray acceleration in
supernova shock waves, and the particle acceleration and disk structure are
treated in a coupled, self-consistent manner based on a rigorous mathematical
approach. We find that first-order Fermi acceleration at standing shocks in
advection-dominated disks proves to be a very efficient means for accelerating
the jet particles. Using physical parameters appropriate for M87 and SgrA*, we
verify that the jet kinetic luminosities computed using our model agree with
estimates based on observations of the sources.",2005-06-23T02:57:32Z
Chemical differentiation along the CepA-East outflows,"We present the results of a multiline survey at mm-wavelengths of the Cepheus
A star forming region. Four main flows have been identified: three pointing in
the SW, NE, and SE directions and accelerating high density CS clumps. The
fourth outflow, revealed by high-sensitivity HDO observations, is pointing
towards South and is associated with conditions particularly favourable to a
chemical enrichment. The analysis of the line profiles shows that the SiO
molecule dominates at the highest velocities and at the highest excitation
conditions, confirming its close association with shocks. H2S, SO2, and SO
preferentially trace more quiescent regions than SiO, and in particular a lack
of bright H2S emission at the highest velocities is found. OCS and H2CS emit at
quite high velocities, where the abundances of three shock tracers like SiO,
CH3OH, and HDO are higher. These results may indicate that H2S is not the only
major sulphur carrier in the grain mantles, and that OCS and H2CS may probably
play an important role on the grains; or that alternatively they rapidly form
once the mantle is evaporated after the passage of a shock. Finally, the
outflow peak emission has been compared with recent time-dependent sulphur
chemistry models: the results indicate that, if associated with accurate
measurements of the physical conditions, the CH3OH/H2CS column density ratio
can be used as an effective chemical clock to date the age of shocked gas.",2005-05-09T14:14:02Z
"NIR observations of dEs in the Virgo cluster: a structural continuity
  with giant Ellipticals","The structural properties of a sample of 50 dEs in the Virgo cluster are here
derived from Near InfraRed (NIR, H-band 1.65 micron) surface photometry and
analysed. One-dimensional surface brightness (SB) profiles are extracted using
elliptical isophote fitting. They are characterised by means of structural
parameters, namely the half light radius R_e, the average surface brightness
within R_e (mu_e), and a concentration index (c_31). We show that typical dEs
have close-to-exponential NIR SB distributions. The relations between dEs and
giant ellipticals (Es) are investigated by comparing the NIR structural
parameters of 273 Es in nearby clusters. Further analysis is conducted using
the optical-NIR colour B-H and by studying the relationships between structural
and dynamical parameters (fundamental plane) for the two classes of galaxies.
The transition between the two regimes is smooth and no dichotomy is seen.",2005-04-21T07:58:42Z
The 3-D Structure of the Helix Nebula,"The 3-D structure of the Helix Nebula has been addressed multiple times and
is slowly yielding to application of monochromatic emission line imaging, high
resolution spectroscopy, and photoionization theory. The inner structure of the
nebula is a toroidal disk filled with doubly ionized helium and is ionization
bounded, with an extended vertical component resembling the structure of
numerous bipolar nebulae. The outer structure is less well defined, with one
construction being that there is an open-center outer-disk that is nearly
perpendicular to the inner-disk and an alternate construction that explains the
features seen just outside the inner-disk as being the result of the observer's
line of sight passing through extended lobes perpendicular to the inner-disk. A
definitive model awaits thorough velocity mapping in the major diagnostic
emission lines. However, even our well-defined knowledge of the inner-disk
defies explanation by the simplest application of the broadly accepted two-wind
model for the formation of PN.",2005-05-26T15:46:14Z
The Luminosity Function of X-ray Point Sources in Centaurus A,"We have studied the X-ray point source population of Centaurus A (NGC 5128)
using data from four archival CHANDRA observations. We detected 272 point-like
X-ray sources within a radius of 10 arcmin from the centre. Approximately half
of these are CXB sources, with the remaining half being LMXBs. The spatial
distribution of the LMXBs, both azimuthally averaged and 2-D, is consistent
with the distribution of the K-band light observed in the 2MASS survey. After
correction for the incompleteness effect we constrain the LMXB luminosity
function down to 2 times 10^{36} erg/s, much lower than previous studies of
LMXBs in elliptical galaxies. The obtained XLF flattens significantly below L_X
= 5 times 10^{37} erg/s and follows the dN/dL proportional to 1/L law in
agreement with the behaviour found earlier for LMXBs in the Milky Way and in
the bulge of M31.",2005-05-12T17:16:19Z
"Constraints on the dense matter EOS from the measurements of PSR
  J0737-3039A moment of inertia and PSR J0751+1807 mass","The moment of inertia of the pulsar A in the neutron star binary J0737-3039
will soon be measurable through detailed measurements of the periastron
advance. We present the calculation of the moment of inertia of neutron stars
with the masses of the components of the binary J0737-3039 for a broad range of
equations of state of dense matter and discuss the implications of such
measurement for constraining the equation of state. An observational
determination of the moment of inertia of the pulsar A in J0737-3039 with the
accuracy of 10% shall narrow down considerably the range of viable equations of
state. We also show that limits on maximal mass of a neutron star provide a
complementary set of constraints on the properties of dense nuclear matter.",2005-08-03T13:06:48Z
"QPOs and firehose instabilities in neutron star magnetospheres in
  accreting systems","We show that the interaction of an accretion disk with the magnetosphere of a
neutron star can excite resonant shear Alfven waves with Hz-kHz frequencies in
a region of enhanced density gradients. This is the the region where accretion
material flows along the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere. We argue
that due to the pressure anisotropy produced by the plasma flow, firehose
instabilities are likely to occur. Furthermore, for a dipolar field topology,
we show that a new instability develops due to both magnetic field curvature
and the plasma flow.",2005-06-04T06:05:56Z
"Site testing in summer at Dome C, Antarctica","We present summer site testing results based on DIMM data obtained at Dome C,
Antarctica. These data have been collected on the bright star Canopus during
two 3-months summer campaigns in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. We performed
continuous monitoring of the seeing a nd the isoplanatic angle in the visible.
We found a median seeing of 0.54 \arcsec and a median isoplanatic angle of 6.8
\arcsec. The seeing appears to have a deep minimum around 0.4 \arcsec almost
every day in late afternoon.",2005-07-20T12:03:26Z
"RASS-SDSS Galaxy Cluster Survey. IV. A ubiquitous dwarf galaxy
  population in clusters","We analyze the Luminosity Functions (LFs) of a subsample of 69 clusters from
the RASS-SDSS galaxy cluster catalog. When calculated within the cluster
physical sizes, given by r200 or r500, all the cluster LFs appear to have the
same shape, well fitted by a composite of two Schechter functions with a marked
upturn and a steepening at the faint-end. Previously reported
cluster-to-cluster variations of the LF faint-end slope are due to the use of a
metric cluster aperture for computing the LF of clusters of different masses.
  We determine the composite LF for early- and late-type galaxies, where the
typing is based on the galaxy u-r colors. The late-type LF is well fitted by a
single Schechter function with a steep slope (alpha=-2.0 in the r band, within
r200}). The early-type LF instead cannot be fitted by a single Schechter
function, and a composite of two Schechter functions is needed. The faint-end
upturn of the global cluster LF is due to the early-type cluster galaxies. The
shape of the bright-end tail of the early-type LF does not seem to depend upon
the local galaxy density or the distance from the cluster center. The late-type
LF shows a significant variation only very near the cluster center. On the
other hand, the faint-end tail of the early-type LF shows a significant and
continuous variation with the environment. We provide evidence that the process
responsible for creating the excess population of dwarf early type galaxies in
clusters is a threshold process that occurs when the density exceeds ~500 times
the critical density of the Universe. We interpret our results in the context
of the 'harassment' scenario, where faint early-type cluster galaxies are
predicted to be the descendants of tidally-stripped late-type galaxies.",2005-06-09T13:32:10Z
Neutrino Astronomy beyond and beneath the Horizons,"The Earth's Shadow to Cosmic Rays offer a windows to Tau Neutrino Astronomy
at the Horizon edges. Inclined and Horizontal C.R. Showers (70^o-90^o zenith
angle) produce secondary (gamma,e) mostly suppressed by high column atmosphere
depth. The shower Cherenkov photons are diluted and filtered by air opacity,
but secondary penetrating, muon pairs and their decay into electron pairs,
revive additional Cerenkov flash lights. Most largest GeVs gamma telescopes may
detect such UHECR horizontal showers. Arrival angle and column depth, shower
shape, timing may inform on the altitude interaction and on primary UHECR
composition. At larger zenith angle (90^o-99^o) more rare up-going showers are
traced by muon (as well electromagnetic) bundles that would give evidence of
rare Earth-Skimming neutrinos, tau and anti-tau neutrinos, at PeVs-EeVs
energies. Their rate may be comparable with 6.3 PeVs anti-neutrino electron
induced air-shower originated in interposed atmosphere, by W^- resonance at
Glashow peak. Additional and complementary UHE SUSY neutralino or staus may
blaze. Their nature might be disentangled by Stereoscopic Telescopes array.
Magic and Hess telescope in present set up may be already comparable to AMANDA
underground neutrino detector. Such telescopes pointing at the horizons toward
active sources (AGN,BL Lac Objects, GRBs or SGRs blazing micro-quasar jet, and
SNRs) do experience in those directions an air mass corresponding to a km^3
water one. Therefore Horizontal Showering is already the most sensitive windows
to Neutrino Astronomy possibly pointing to AGN,GRB or SGR events.",2005-05-21T16:26:26Z
"Multi-Dimensional Density Estimation and Phase Space Structure Of Dark
  Matter Halos","We present a method to numerically estimate the densities of a discretely
sampled data based on binary space partitioning tree. We start with a root node
containing all the particles and then recursively divide each node into two
nodes each containing roughly equal number of particles,until each of the nodes
contains only one particle. The volume of such a leaf node provides an estimate
of the local density. We implement an entropy-based node splitting criterion
that results in a significant improvement in the estimation of densities
compared to earlier work. The method is completely metric free and can be
applied to arbitrary number of dimensions. We apply this method to determine
the phase space densities of dark matter halos obtained from cosmological
N-body simulations. We find that contrary to earlier studies, the volume
distribution function $v(f)$ of phase space density $f$ does not have a
constant slope but rather a small hump at high phase space densities. We
demonstrate that a model in which a halo is made up by a superposition of
Hernquist spheres is not capable in explaining the shape of $v(f)$ vs $f$
relation, whereas a model which takes into account the contribution of the main
halo separately roughly reproduces the behavior as seen in simulations. The use
of the presented method is not limited to calculation of phase space densities,
but can be used as a general-purpose data-mining tool and due to its speed and
accuracy it is ideally suited for analysis of large multidimensional data sets.",2005-07-24T19:47:18Z

Radiative Habitable Zones in Martian Polar Environments,"The biologically damaging solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (quantified by the
DNA-weighted dose) reaches the Martian surface in extremely high levels.
Searching for potentially habitable UV-protected environments on Mars, we
considered the polar ice caps that consist of a seasonally varying CO2 ice
cover and a permanent H2O ice layer. It was found that, though the CO2 ice is
insufficient by itself to screen the UV radiation, at 1 m depth within the
perennial H2O ice the DNA-weighted dose is reduced to terrestrial levels. This
depth depends strongly on the optical properties ofthe H2O ice layers (for
instance snow-lile layes). The Earth-like DNA-weighted dose and
Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) requirements were used to define the
upper and lower limits of the nortern and southern polar radiative habitable
zone (RHZ) for which a temporal and spatial mapping was performed. Based on
these studies we conclude that phtosynthetic life might be possible within the
ice layers of the polar regions. The thickness varies along each Martian polar
spring and summer between 1.5 m and 2.4 m for H2= ice-like layers, and a few
centimeters for snow-like covers. These Martian Earth-like radiative habitable
environments may be primary targets for future Martian astrobiological
missions. Special attention should be paid to planetary protection, since the
polar RHZ may also be subject to terrestrial contamination by probes.",2005-07-13T10:40:53Z
Integrated spectrum of the planetary nebula NGC 7027,"We present deep optical spectra of the archetypal young planetary nebula (PN)
NGC 7027, covering a wavelength range from 3310 to 9160 A. The observations
were carried out by uniformly scanning a long slit across the entire nebular
surface, thus yielding average optical spectra for the whole nebula. A total of
937 emission features are detected. The extensive line list presented here
should prove valuable for future spectroscopic analyses of emission line
nebulae. The optical data, together with the archival IUE and ISO spectra, are
used to probe the temperature and density structures and to determine the
elemental abundances from lines produced by different excitation mechanisms.
The C++/H+, N++/H+, O++/H+ and Ne++/H+ ionic abundance ratios derived from
optical recombination lines (ORLs) are found to be only slightly higher than
those derived from collisionally excited lines (CELs). We conclude that
whatever mechanism is causing the BJ/CEL temperature discrepanies and the
ORL/CEL abundance discrepancies that have been observed in many PNe, it has an
insignificant effect on this bright young compact PN. The properties of the
central star are also discussed. Based on the integrated spectrum and using the
energy-balance method, we have derived an effective temperature of 219 000 K
for the ionizing star. Finally, we report the first detection in the spectrum
of this bright young PN of Raman-scattered O VI features at 6830 and 7088 A,
pointing to the existence of abundant neutral hydrogen around the ionized
regions. (abridged)",2005-07-07T03:43:06Z
"Boundary layer emission and Z-track in the color-color diagram of
  luminous LMXBs","We demonstrate that Fourier-frequency resolved spectra of atoll and Z-
sources are identical, despite significant difference in their average spectra
and luminosity (by a factor of ~10-20). This result fits in the picture we
suggested earlier, namely that the f> 1 Hz variability in luminous LMXBs is
primarily due to variations of the boundary layer luminosity. In this picture
the frequency resolved spectrum equals the boundary layer spectrum, which
therefore can be straightforwardly determnined from the data. The obtained so
boundary layer spectrum is well approximated by the saturated Comptonization
model, its high energy cut-off follows kT~2.4 keV black body. Its independence
on the global mass accretion rate lends support to the theoretical suggestion
by Inogamov &Sunyaev (1999) that the boundary layer is radiation pressure
supported. With this assumption we constrain the gravity on the neutron star
surface and its mass and radius. Equipped with the knowledge of the boundary
layer spectrum we attempt to relate the motion along the Z-track to changes of
physically meaningful parameters. Our results suggest that the contribution of
the boundary layer to the observed emission decreases along the Z-track from
conventional ~50% on the horizontal branch to a rather small number on the
normal branch. This decrease can be caused, for example, by obscuration of the
boundary layer by the geometrically thick accretion disk at Mdot ~ Mdot_Edd.
Alternatively, this can indicate significant change of the structure of the
accretion flow at Mdot ~ Mdot_ Edd and disappearance of the boundary layer as a
distinct region of the significant energy release associated with the neutron
star surface.",2005-06-01T13:54:30Z
Pair Correlations and Merger Bias,"We study analytically the possibility that mergers of haloes are more highly
clustered than the general population of haloes of comparable masses. We begin
by investigating predictions for merger bias within the extended
Press-Schechter formalism and discuss the limitations and ambiguities of this
approach. We then postulate that mergers occur whenever two objects form within
a (small) fixed distance of each other. We therefore study the clustering of
pairs of points for a highly biased population in the linear regime, for the
overall mass distribution in the quasilinear regime, and (using the halo model
of clustering) in the nonlinear regime. Biasing, quasilinear evolution, and
nonlinear clustering all lead to nonzero reduced (or connected) three-point and
four-point correlation functions. These higher-order correlation functions can
in many cases enhance the clustering of close pairs of points relative to the
clustering of individual points. If close pairs are likely to merge, then the
clustering of mergers may be enhanced. We discuss implications for the observed
clustering of luminous z=3 galaxies and for correlations of active galactic
nuclei and galaxy clusters.",2005-07-27T20:37:07Z
"Sgr A East as a possible high energy neutron factory in the Galactic
  Centre","Sgr A East is a supernova remnant located within few parsecs from the
Galactic Centre (GC). There are good reasons to believe that this object is the
source of the gamma-ray excess detected by HESS in the direction of the GC
meaning that Sgr A East is likely to be an efficient Cosmic Ray accelerator.
Some observations suggest that strong magnetic fields may be present in that
region allowing the acceleration of composite nuclei in Sgr A East beyond the
EeV. We show that, if this is case, EeV neutrons should be effectively produced
by the photo-disintegration of Ultra High Energy nuclei onto the IR photon
background (with temperature $\sim 40$ K) in which Sgr A East is embedded.
  Neutrons with such an energy can reach the Earth before decaying and may be
detectable under the form of a CR point-like excess in the direction of the GC.
  We determine the expected energy spectrum and the amplitude of this signal
showing that it may be measurable by the AUGER observatory.",2005-04-14T12:56:35Z
"Taylor-Couette flow: MRI, SHI and SRI","The linear stability theory of Taylor-Couette flows (unbounded in_z_) is
described including magnetic fields, Hall effect or a density stratification in
order to prepare laboratory experiments to probe the stability of differential
rotation in astrophysics. If an axial field is present then the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) is investigated also for small magnetic
Prandtl numbers. For rotating outer cylinder beyond the Rayleigh line
characteristic minima are found for magnetic Reynolds number of the order of 10
and for Lundquist numbers of order 1. The inclusion of extra toroidal
current-free fields leads to new oscillating solutions with rather low Reynolds
numbers and Hartmann numbers. The Hall effect establishes an unexpected
`shear-Hall instability' (SHI) where shear and magnetic field have opposite
signs. In this case even rotation laws increasing outwards may become unstable.
Recently global solutions have been found for the Taylor-Couette flows with
density stratified in axial directions (`stratorotational instability', SRI).
They exist beyond the Rayleigh line for Froude numbers of moderate order but
also not for too flat rotation laws with \hat\eta^2 < \hat\mu <\hat \eta.",2005-07-13T06:10:07Z
XMM-Newton EPIC background modeling for extended sources,"We use XMM-Newton blank-sky and closed-cover background data to explore the
background subtraction methods for large extended sources filling the EPIC
field of view, such as nearby galaxy clusters, for which local background
estimation is difficult. We find that to keep the 0.8-7.0 keV band background
modeling uncertainty tolerable, one has to use a much more restrictive filter
than that commonly applied. In particular, because flares have highly variable
spectra, not all of them are identified by filtering the E>10 keV light curve.
We tried using the outer part of the EPIC FOV for monitoring the background in
a softer band (1-5 keV). We find that one needs to discard the time periods
when either the hard-band or the soft-band rate exceeds the nominal value by
more than 20% in order to limit the 90% CL background uncertainty to between 5%
at E=4-7 keV and 20% at E=0.8-1 keV, for both MOS and PN. This compares to a
10-30% respective PN uncertainty when only the hard-band light curve is used
for filtering, and to a 15-45% PN uncertainty when applying the commonly used
2-3 sigma filtering method. We illustrate our method on a nearby cluster A1795.
The above background uncertainties convert into the systematic temperature
uncertainties between 1% at r=3-4 arcmin and 20--25% (~1 keV for A1795) at
r=10-15 arcmin. For comparison, the commonly applied 2-3 sigma clipping of the
hard-band light curve misses a significant amount of flares, rendering the
temperatures beyond r=10 arcmin unconstrained. Thus, the background
uncertainties do not prohibit the EPIC temperature profile analysis of
low-brightness regions, like outer regions of galaxy clusters, provided a
conservative flare filtering such as the double filtering method with 20%
limits is used.",2005-04-16T12:38:02Z
"X-ray Diagnostics of Grain Depletion in Matter Accreting onto T Tauri
  Stars","Recent analysis of high resolution Chandra X-ray spectra has shown that the
Ne/O abundance ratio is remarkably constant in stellar coronae. Based on this
result, we point out the utility of the Ne/O ratio as a discriminant for
accretion-related X-rays from T Tauri stars, and for probing the measure of
grain-depletion of the accreting material in the inner disk. We apply the Ne/O
diagnostic to the classical T Tauri stars BP Tau and TW Hya--the two stars
found to date whose X-ray emission appears to originate, at least in part, from
accretion activity. We show that TW Hya appears to be accreting material which
is significantly depleted in O relative to Ne. In constrast, BP Tau has an Ne/O
abundance ratio consistent with that observed for post-T Tauri stars. We
interpret this result in terms of the different ages and evolutionary states of
the circumstellar disks of these stars. In the young BP Tau disk (age 0.6 Myr)
dust is still present near the disk corotation radius and can be ionized and
accreted, re-releasing elements depleted onto grains. In the more evolved TW
Hya disk (age 10 Myr), evidence points to ongoing coagulation of grains into
much larger bodies, and possibly planets, that can resist the drag of
inward-migrating gas, and accreting gas is consequently depleted of
grain-forming elements.",2005-06-08T20:10:53Z
"Photon-axion conversion as a mechanism for supernova dimming: Limits
  from CMB spectral distortion","Axion-photon conversion induced by intergalactic magnetic fields has been
proposed as an explanation for the dimming of distant supernovae of type Ia SNe
Ia) without cosmic acceleration. The effect depends on the intergalactic
electron density $n_e$ as well as the $B$-field strength and domain size. We
show that for $n_e\alt 10^{-9} {\rm cm}^{-3}$ the same mechanism would cause
excessive spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This
small-$n_e$ parameter region had been left open by the most restrictive
previous constraints based on the dispersion of quasar (QSO) spectra. The
combination of CMB and QSO limits suggests that the photon-axion conversion
mechanism can only play a subleading role for SN Ia dimming. A combined
analysis of all the observables affected by the photon-axion oscillations would
be required to give a final verdict on the viability of this model.",2005-06-03T15:35:52Z
Precision Determination of the Mass Function of Dark Matter Halos,"The predicted mass function of dark matter halos is essential in connecting
observed galaxy cluster counts and models of galaxy clustering to the
properties of the primordial density field. We determine the mass function in
the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, as well as its uncertainty, using
sixteen $1024^3$-particle nested-volume dark-matter simulations, spanning a
mass range of over five orders of magnitude. Using the nested volumes and
single-halo tests, we find and correct for a systematic error in the
friends-of-friends halo-finding algorithm. We find a fitting form and full
error covariance for the mass function that successfully describes the
simulations' mass function and is well-behaved outside the simulations'
resolutions. Estimated forecasts of uncertainty in cosmological parameters from
future cluster count surveys have negligible contribution from remaining
statistical uncertainties in the central cosmology multiplicity function. There
exists a potentially non-negligible cosmological dependence (non-universality)
of the halo multiplicity function.",2005-06-16T20:24:26Z
HST and spectroscopic observations of the L1551 IRS5 jets (HH154),"We have carried out a thorough optical study of the closest star formation
jet. The inner arcminute surrounding the class 0/I binary protostar L1551 IRS5
and its associated jet (HH154) have been observed using the Hubble Space
Telescope with the WFPC2 camera, the ESO New Technology Telescope with the EMMI
spectrograph and the Nordic Optical Telescope with the ALFOSC spectrograph.
This data set is compared to earlier ground based imaging with the aim to study
the evolution of this particular jet, and its possible interaction with the
molecular material in the bipolar molecular outflow associated with this
source. The velocity field of the jet is mapped out. The highest velocities are
found in the vicinity of the recently discovered X-ray source emanating from a
shock in this jet. The energy radiated by the X-ray source is compatible with
these velocities. The \halpha and \hbeta emission from the jet is used to
determine the extinction, which is found to increase inwards in the jet towards
the protostar. The extinction towards the X-ray source is consistent with the
one determined from the X-ray spectrum.",2005-03-22T12:16:50Z
E = mc^2 Without Relativity,"The equivalence of mass and energy is indelibly linked with relativity, both
by scientists and in the popular mind. I prove that E = mc^2 by demanding
momentum conservation of an object that emits two equal electromagnetic wave
packets in opposite directions in its own frame. In contrast to Einstein's
derivation of this equation, which applies energy conservation to a similar
thought experiment, the new derivation employs no effects that are greater than
first order in v/c and therefore does not rely on results from Special
Relativity. In addition to momentum conservation, it uses only aberration of
starlight and the electromagnetic-wave momentum-energy relation p=E/c, both of
which were established by 1884. In particular, no assumption is made about the
constancy of the speed of light, and the derivation proceeds equally well if
one assumes that light is governed by a Galilean transformation. In view of
this, it is somewhat puzzling that the equivalence of mass and energy was not
derived well before the advent of Special Relativity. The new derivation is
simpler and more transparent than Einstein's and is therefore pedagogically
useful.",2005-04-22T15:57:24Z
MgII Absorption through Intermediate Redshift Galaxies,"The current status and remaining questions of MgII absorbers are reviewed
with an eye toward new results incorporating high quality Hubble Space
Telescope images of the absorbing galaxies. In the end, we find that our
current picture of extended gaseous regions around galaxies at earlier epochs
is in need of some revision; MgII absorbing ""halos"" appear to be patchier and
their geometry less regular than previously inferred. We also find that the
so-called ""weak"" MgII absorbers are associated with normal galaxies over a wide
range of impact parameters, suggesting that this class of absorber does not
strictly select low surface brightness, dwarf galaxies, or IGM material. We
emphasize the need for a complete survey of the galaxies in quasar fields, and
the importance of obtaining rotation curves of confirmed absorbing galaxies.",2005-04-18T15:35:21Z
"The Core-Collapse Supernova with ""Non-Uniform"" Magnetic Fields","We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations on the core-collapse of a
massive star with strong magnetic fields and differential rotations using a
numerical code ZEUS-2D. Changing field configurations and laws of differential
rotation parametrically, we compute 14 models and investigate effects of these
parameters on the dynamics. In our models, we do not solve the neutrino
transport and instead employ a phenomenological parametric EOS that takes into
account the neutrino emissions. As a result of the calculations, we find that
the field configuration plays a significant role in the dynamics of the core if
the initial magnetic field is large enough. Models with initially concentrated
fields produce more energetic explosions and more prolate shock waves than the
uniform field. Quadrapole-like fields produce remarkably collimated and fast
jet, which might be important for gamma-ray bursts(GRB). The Lorentz forces
exerted in the region where the plasma-beta is less than unity are responsible
for these dynamics. The pure toroidal field, on the other hand, does not lead
to any explosion or matter ejection. This suggests the presupernova models of
Heger et al.(2003), in which toroidal fields are predominant, is
disadvantageous for the magnetorotation-induced supernova considered here.
Models with initially weak magnetic fields do not lead to explosion or matter
ejection, either. In these models magnetic fields play no role as they do not
grow on the timescale considered in this paper so that the magnetic pressure
could be comparable to the matter pressure. This is because the exponential
field growth as expected in MRI is not seen in our models. The magnetic field
is amplified mainly by field-compression and field-wrapping in our simulations.",2005-05-31T16:46:56Z
"The nature of Composite Seyfert/Star-forming galaxies revealed by X-ray
  observations","This paper presents new Chandra and BeppoSAX observations aimed at
investigating the optical/X-ray mismatch in the enigmatic class of the
Composite galaxies, discovered by a cross-correlation of IRAS and ROSAT all sky
survey catalogues. These galaxies have been classified as star-forming objects
on the basis of their optical spectra, while the detection of weak broad wings
in the H(alpha) emission in a few of them and their high X-ray luminosity in
the ROSAT band indicated the presence of an active nucleus. The analysis of
Chandra observations for 4 Composites has revealed nuclear point-like sources,
with a typical AGN spectrum (Gamma = 1.7-1.9) and little intrinsic absorption.
A strong flux variability has been observed on different time scales, in
particular most of the sources were brighter at the ROSAT epoch. Although of
relative low luminosity for the AGN class (L(2-10 keV) = 3-60 x 10^{41} erg/s),
the active nucleus is nevertheless dominant in the X-ray domain. At other
wavelengths it appears to be overwhelmed by the starburst and/or host galaxy
light, yielding the Composite classification for these objects.",2005-06-06T13:13:40Z
"C,N,O in lambda Boo stars and in composite spectra","The selective abundance of C, N, O (almost solar) with respect to that of
other elements (underabundant) in lambda Boo stars has been interpreted as a
characteristic peculiarity of these objects, when considered as single stars.
We show here that a similar selective abundance is predicted from the composite
spectra resulting from two unresolved stars in the same temperature range as
the lambda Boo stars.",2005-04-05T10:05:47Z
GRAPE-6A: A single-card GRAPE-6 for parallel PC-GRAPE cluster system,"In this paper, we describe the design and performance of GRAPE-6A, a
special-purpose computer for gravitational many-body simulations. It was
designed to be used with a PC cluster, in which each node has one GRAPE-6A.
Such configuration is particularly effective in running parallel tree
algorithm. Though the use of parallel tree algorithm was possible with the
original GRAPE-6 hardware, it was not very cost-effective since a single
GRAPE-6 board was still too fast and too expensive. Therefore, we designed
GRAPE-6A as a single PCI card to minimize the reproduction cost and optimize
the computing speed. The peak performance is 130 Gflops for one GRAPE-6A board
and 3.1 Tflops for our 24 node cluster. We describe the implementation of the
tree, TreePM and individual timestep algorithms on both a single GRAPE-6A
system and GRAPE-6A cluster. Using the tree algorithm on our 16-node GRAPE-6A
system, we can complete a collisionless simulation with 100 million particles
(8000 steps) within 10 days.",2005-04-19T06:45:13Z
The Anthropic Principle and the Duration of the Cosmological Past,"The place of an anthropic argument in the discrimination between various
cosmological models is to be reconsidered following the classic criticisms of
Paul C. W. Davies and Frank J. Tipler. Different versions of the anthropic
argument against cosmologies involving an infinite series of past events are
analyzed and applied to several instructive instances. This is not only of
historical significance but presents an important topic for the future of
cosmological research if some of the contemporary inflationary models,
particularly Linde's chaotic inflation, turn out to be correct. Cognitive
importance of the anthropic principle(s) to the issue of extraterrestrial
intelligent observers is reconsidered in this light and several related
problems facing cosmologies with past temporal infinities are also clearly
defined. This issue is not only a clear example of the epistemological
significance of the anthropic principle, but also has consequences for such
diverse topics as SETI studies, epistemological status of cosmological
concepts, theory of observation selection effects, and history of astronomy.",2005-04-30T14:26:02Z
A combined optical/infrared spectral diagnostic analysis of the HH1 jet,"Complete flux-calibrated spectra covering the spectral range from 6000 A to
2.5 um have been obtained along the HH1 jet and analysed in order to explore
the potential of a combined optical/near-IR diagnostic applied to jets from
young stellar objects. Important physical parameters have been derived along
the jet using various diagnostic line ratios. This multi-line analysis shows,
in each spatially unresolved knot, the presence of zones at different
excitation conditions, as expected from the cooling layers behind a shock
front. In particular, a density stratification in the jet is evident from
ratios of various lines of different critical density. In particular, [FeII]
lines originate in a cooling layer located at larger distances from the shock
front than that generating the optical lines, where the compression is higher
and the temperature is declining. The derived parameters were used to measure
the mass flux along the jet, adopting different procedures, the advantages and
limitations of which are discussed. dM/dt is high in the initial part of the
flow but decreases by about an order of magnitude further out. Conversely, the
mass flux associated with the warm molecular material is low and does not show
appreciable variations along the jet. We suggest that part of the mass flux in
the external regions is not revealed in optical and IR lines because it is
associated with a colder atomic component, which may be traced by the far-IR [O
I]63 um line.
  Finally, we find that the gas-phase abundance of refractory species is lower
than the solar value suggesting that a significant fraction of dust grains may
still be present in the jet beam.",2005-07-04T16:09:34Z
Exploiting VERITAS Timing Information,"The 499 pixel photomultiplier cameras of the VERITAS gamma ray telescopes are
instrumented with 500MHz sampling Flash ADCs. This paper describes a
preliminary investigation of the best methods by which to exploit this
information so as to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of
Cherenkov light pulses. The FADCs also provide unprecedented resolution for the
study of the timing characteristics of Cherenkov images of cosmic-ray and
gamma-ray air showers. This capability is discussed, together with the
implications for gamma-hadron separation.",2005-07-19T18:39:35Z
"State transition and flaring activity of IGR J17464-3213/H1743-322 with
  SPI/INTEGRAL telescope","IGR J17464-3213, already known as the HEAO-1 transient source H1743-322, has
been detected during a state transition by the SPI/INTEGRAL telescope. We
describe the spectral evolution and flaring activity of IGR
J17464-3213/H1743-322 from 2003 March 21 to 2003 April 22. During the first
part, the source followed a continuous spectral softening, with the peak of the
spectral energy distribution shifting from 100 keV down to a few keV. However
the thermal disk and the hard X-ray components had a similar intensity,
indicating that the source was in an intermediate state throughout our
observations and evolving toward the soft state. In the second part of our
observations, the ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL light curve showed a strong flaring
activity. Two flare events lasting about 1 day each have been detected with SPI
and are probably due to instabilities in the accretion disk associated with the
state transition. During these flares, the low (1.5-12 keV) and high (20-200
keV) energy fluxes monitored with ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL, are correlated and
the spectral shape (above 20 keV) remains unchanged while the luminosity
increases by a factor greater than 2.",2005-05-19T15:05:38Z
"The 1 - 50 keV spectral and timing analysis of IGR J18027-2016: an
  eclipsing, high mass X-ray binary","We report the association of the INTEGRAL source IGR J18027-2016 with the
BeppoSAX source SAX J1802.7-2017. IGR J18027-2016 is seen to be a weak,
persistent source by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board INTEGRAL with an
average source count rate of 0.55 counts s^-1 (~6.1 mCrab) in the 20-40 keV
band. Timing analysis performed on the ISGRI data identifies an orbital period
of 4.5696 +/- 0.0009 days and gives an ephemeris of mid-eclipse as, T{mid} =
52931.37 +/- 0.04 MJD. Re-analysis of archival BeppoSAX data has provided a
mass function for the donor star, f(m) = 16 +/- 1 M{sun} and a projected
semimajor axis of a{x}sin{i} = 68 +/- 1 lt-s. We conclude that the donor is an
OB-supergiant with a mass of 18.8-29.3 M{sun} and a radius of 15.0-23.4 R{sun}.
Spectra obtained by XMM-Newton and ISGRI indicate a high hydrogen column
density of NH = 6.8 x 10^22 cm^-2, which suggests intrinsic absorption. The
source appears to be a high mass X-ray binary with the neutron star emitting
X-rays through wind-fed accretion while in an eclipsing orbit around an
OB-supergiant.",2005-05-04T17:13:36Z
Radio Spectral Index Variations of the SNR HB3,"We present images of the SNR HB3 at both 408 MHz and 1420 MHz from the
Canadian Galactic Plane Survey mainly based on data from the Synthesis
Telescope of the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory. We reproduce the
100m-Effelsberg HB3 image at 2695 MHz at large scale, and find that there
exists a background emission gradient across the HB3 area. Based on our
analysis of background emission and the boundary between W3 and HB3, we give
HB3's flux density as 68.6 +/- 11.5 Jy at 408 MHz and 44.8 +/- 12.0 Jy at 1420
MHz, after subtracting flux from compact sources within HB3. The integrated
flux-density-based spectral index between 408 MHz and 1420 MHz is 0.34 +/-
0.15. The averaged T-T plot spectral index using all subareas is 0.36. Our
measurement values are less than a previously published value of 0.6. The
408-1420 MHz spectral index varies spatially in HB3 in the range 0.1 to 0.7. We
investigate the data used by previous authors, and consider more data at 232
MHz, 3650 MHz and 3900 MHz which are not included in previous calculations.
There is evidence for two spectral indices for HB3 in the radio band, i.e.,
0.63 (38 - 610 MHz) and 0.32 (408 - 3900 MHz). This is consistent with the
spatial variations: the low frequency data mainly reflects the steeper indices
and the high frequency data mainly reflects the flatter indices.",2005-04-13T17:36:39Z
"Numerical Relativistic Hydrodynamics Based on the Total Variation
  Diminishing Scheme","This paper describes a multidimensional hydrodynamic code which can be used
for studies of relativistic astrophysical flows. The code solves the special
relativistic hydrodynamic equations as a hyperbolic system of conservation laws
based on the total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme. It uses a new set of
conserved quantities and employs an analytic formula for transformation from
the conserved quantities in the reference frame to the physical quantities in
the local rest frame. Several standard tests, including relativistic shock
tubes, a relativistic wall shock, and a relativistic blast wave, are presented
to demonstrate that the code captures discontinuities correctly and sharply in
ultrarelativistic regimes. The robustness and flexibility of the code are
demonstrated through test simulations of the relativistic Hawley-Zabusky shock
and a relativistic extragalactic jet.",2005-07-05T09:08:12Z
What we do and do not know about the s-process,"AGB stars are the source for the main component of the $s$-process. Here we
discuss both the properties which are reasonably well known and those which
still suffer from substantial uncertainties. In the former case, we are fairly
sure that the $s$-process contribution from AGB stars comes from masses between
about 1 and 3 $\msun$, and the dominant neutron source is the
$^{13}$C$(\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O reaction. In the latter category remains the
formation mechanism for the $^{13}$C-pocket. Attempts at including rotation
seem to inhibit neutron capture reactions. Explaining the observations seems to
require a spread in the size of the $^{13}$C-pocket so some stochastic process,
such as rotation, must be involved.",2005-05-19T23:41:16Z
"Rights and wrongs of the Hipparcos data: A critical assessment of the
  Hipparcos catalogue","A critical assessment of the quality of the Hipparcos data, partly supported
by a completely new analysis of the raw data, is presented with the aim of
clarifying reliability issues that have surfaced since the publication of the
Hipparcos catalogue in 1997. A number of defects in the data are identified,
such as scan-phase discontinuities and effects of external hits. These defects
can be repaired when re-reducing the raw data. Instabilities in the
great-circle reduction process are recognised and identified in a number of
data sets. These resulted mainly from the difficult observing conditions
imposed by the anomalous orbit of the satellite. The stability of the basic
angle over the mission is confirmed, but the connectivity between the two
fields of view has been less than optimal for some parts of the sky. Both are
fundamental conditions for producing absolute parallaxes. Although there is
clear room for improvement of the Hipparcos data, the catalogue as published
remains generally reliable within the quoted accuracies. Some of the findings
presented here are also relevant for the forthcoming Gaia mission.",2005-05-20T09:03:32Z
The effects of thermal conduction on the hot accretion flows,"Thermal conduction has been suggested as a possible mechanism by which
sufficient extra heating is provided in radiation-dominated accretion flows. We
consider the extreme case in which the generated energy due to the viscosity
and the energy transported by a saturated form of thermal conduction are
balanced by the advection cooling. For the steady-state structure of such
accretion flows a set of self-similar solution are presented. Based on these
solutions while the radial and the rotational velocities are both
sub-Keplerian, increasing the level of thermal conduction has the effects of
decreasing the rotational velocity, but increasing the radial velocity.
Conduction provides extra heating and the temperature of the gas increases with
thermal conduction.",2005-07-24T07:05:27Z
Optical and Infrared Signatures of ULX's,"We have constructed a model to describe the optical emission from
ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We assume a binary model with a black hole
accreting matter from a Roche lobe filling companion star. We consider the
effects of radiative transport and radiative equilibrium in the irradiated
surfaces of both the star and a thin accretion disk. We have developed this
model as a tool with which to positively identify the optical counterparts of
ULXs, and subsequently derive parameters such as the black hole mass and the
luminosity class and spectral type of the counterpart. We examine the
dependence of the optical emission on these and other variables. We extend our
model to examine the magnitude variation at infrared wavelengths, and we find
that observations at these wavelengths may have more diagnostic power than in
the optical. We apply our model to existing HST observations of the candidates
for the optical counterpart of ULX X-7 in NGC 4559. All candidates could be
consistent with an irradiated star alone, but we find that a number of them are
too faint to fit with an irradiated star and disk together. Were one of these
the optical counterpart to X-7, it would display a significant temporal
variation.",2005-06-03T16:58:40Z
RAPTOR observations of the early optical afterglow from GRB 050319,"The RAPid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) system at Los Alamos
National Laboratory observed GRB 050319 starting 25.4 seconds after gamma-ray
emission triggered the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on-board the Swift
satellite. Our well sampled light curve of the early optical afterglow is
composed of 32 points (derived from 70 exposures) that measure the flux decay
during the first hour after the GRB. The GRB 050319 light curve measured by
RAPTOR can be described as a relatively gradual flux decline (power-law index
alpha = -0.37) with a transition, at about 400 s after the GRB, to a faster
flux decay (alpha = -0.91). The addition of other available measurements to the
RAPTOR light curve suggests that another emission component emerged after 10^4
s. We hypothesize that the early afterglow emission is powered by extended
energy injection or delayed reverse shock emission followed by the emergence of
forward shock emission.",2005-05-16T23:06:20Z
Metallicity effect in multi-dimensional SNIa nucleosynthesis,"We investigate the metallicity effect (measured by the original 22Ne content)
on the detailed nucleosynthetic yields for 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the
thermonuclear burning phase in SNe Ia. Calculations are based on post-processes
of the ejecta, using passively advected tracer particles, as explained in
details by Travaglio et al.(2004). The nuclear reaction network employed in
computing the explosive nucleosynthesis contains 383 nuclear species. For this
work we use the high resolution multi-point ignition (bubbles) model b30_3d_768
(Travaglio et al.2004 for the solar metallicity case), and we cover a
metallicity range between 0.1xZ_sun up to 3xZ_sun. We find a linear dependence
of the 56Ni mass ejected on the progenitor's metallicity, with a variation in
the 56Ni mass of ~25% in the metallicity range explored. Moreover, the largest
variation in 56Ni occurs at metallicity greater than solar. Almost no
variations are shown in the unburned material 12C and 16O. The largest
metallicity effect is seen in the alpha-elements. Finally, implications for the
observed scatter in the peak luminosities of SNe Ia are also discussed.",2005-07-21T13:12:42Z
Optical Constraints on an X-ray Transient Source in M31,"We have detected a transient X-ray source in the M31 bulge through a
continuing monitoring campaign with the Chandra ACIS-I camera. The source was
detected at R.A.=00:42:33.428 +/- 0.11'', Dec.=+41:17:03.37 +/- 0.11'' in only
a single observation taken 2004 May 23. Fortuitous optical HST/ACS imaging of
the transient location prior to the X-ray outburst, along with follow-up
HST/ACS imaging during and after the outburst, reveals no transient optical
source brighter than B (equivalent) = 25.5. The location of the source and its
X-ray properties suggest it is a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Assuming the
transient is similar to many Galactic X-ray novae, the X-ray luminosity of (3.9
+/- 0.5) X 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the upper-limit on the optical luminosity
provide a prediction of <1.6 days for the orbital period of the binary system.",2005-06-14T15:58:33Z
Peak energy clustering and efficiency in compact objects,"We study the properties of plasmas containing a low energy thermal photon
component at comoving temperature \theta \equiv kT'/m_e c^2 \sim 10^{-5} -
10^{-2} interacting with an energetic electron component, characteristic of,
e.g., the dissipation phase of relativistic outflows in gamma-ray bursts
(GRB's), X-ray flashes, and blazars. We show that, for scattering optical
depths larger than a few, balance between Compton and inverse-Compton
scattering leads to the accumulation of electrons at values of $\gamma\beta ~
0.15 - 0.3$. For optical depths larger than ~ 100, this leads to a peak in the
comoving photon spectrum at 1-10 keV, very weakly dependent on the values of
the free parameters. In particular, these results are applicable to the
internal shock model of GRB, as well as to slow dissipation models, e.g. as
might be expected from reconnection, if the dissipation occurs at a
sub-photospheric radii. For GRB bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100, this results in
observed spectral peaks clustering in the 0.1-1 MeV range, with conversion
efficiencies of electron into photon energy in the BATSE range of ~ 30%.",2005-04-15T12:20:36Z
"Newtonian and general relativistic contribution of gravity to surface
  tension of strange stars","Surface tension (S) is due to the inward force experienced by particles at
the surface and usually gravitation does not play an important role in this
force. But in compact stars the gravitational force on the particles is very
large and S is found to depend not only on the interactions in the strange
quark matter, but also on the structure of the star, i.e. on its mass and
radius. Indeed, it has been claimed recently that 511 keV photons observed by
the space probe INTEGRAL from the galactic bulge may be due to
electron-positron annihilation, and their source may be the positron cloud
outside of an antiquark star. Such stars, if they exist, may also go a long way
towards explaining away the antibaryon deficit of the universe. For that to
happen S must be high enough to allow for survival of quark/antiquark stars
born in early stages of the formation of the universe. High value of S may also
assist explanation of delayed gamma-ray burst after a supernova explosion, as
conversion from normal matter to strange matter takes place. The possibility of
some implications from formation of surface waves are also discussed.",2005-07-26T15:45:28Z
The Excess Far-Infrared Emission of AGN in the Local Universe,"We have cross-correlated the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) second data
release spectroscopic galaxy sample with the IRAS faint-source catalogue (FSC).
Optical emission line ratios are used to classify the galaxies with reliable
IRAS 60 and 100 microns detections into AGN and normal star-forming galaxies.
We then create subsamples of normal galaxies and AGN that are very closely
matched in terms of key physical properties such as stellar mass, redshift,
size, concentration and mean stellar age (as measured by absorption line
indicators in the SDSS spectra). We then quantify whether there are systematic
differences between the IR luminosities of the galaxies and the AGN in the
matched subsamples. We find that the AGN exhibit a significant excess in far-IR
emission relative to the star-forming galaxies in our sample. The excesses at
60 and 100 microns are 0.21 +/- 0.03 dex and 0.12 +/- 0.035 dex in
log[L(60)/M*] and log[L(100)/M*], respectively. We then discuss whether the
far-IR excess is produced by radiation from the active nucleus that is absorbed
by dust or alternatively, by an extra population of young stars that is not
detectable at optical wavelengths.",2005-06-16T14:42:00Z
"The double-mode nature of the HADS star GSC 00144-03031 and the Petersen
  diagram of the class","The double--mode pulsation of GSC 00144-03031 has been detected when
searching for COROT targets. A very large dataset composed of 4722 photometric
measurements was collected at six observatories in Europe and America. There is
no hint of the excitation of additional modes (down to 0.6 mmag) and therefore
GSC 00144-03031 seems to be a pure double--mode pulsator, with a very short
fundamental radial mode (P=84 min). From Stromgren photometry and evolutionary
tracks it appears to be a Pop. I star with M=1.75 solar masses, located in the
middle of the instability strip, close to the Zero--Age Main Sequence. We also
discovered other new double--mode pulsators in the databases of large--scale
projects: OGLE BW2_V142, OGLE BW1_V207, ASAS3 094303-1707.3, ASAS3
000116-6037.0, NSVS 3234596 and NSVS 3324715. An observational Petersen diagram
is presented and explained by means of new models. A common sequence connecting
Pop. I stars from the shortest to the longest periods is proposed and the
spreads in the period ratios are ascribed to different metallicities (at the
shortest periods) and to different masses (at the longest ones). The paper is
based on data collected at S. Pedro Martir and Sierra Nevada Observatories and
on the contributions from several amateur astronomers.",2005-06-13T10:15:05Z
Is Thermal Emission in Gamma-Ray Bursts Ubiquitous?,"The prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts has yet defied any simple
explanation, despite the presence of a rich observational material and great
theoretical efforts. Here we show that all the types of spectral evolution and
spectral shapes that have been observed can indeed be described with one and
the same model, namely a hybrid model of a thermal and a non-thermal component.
We further show that the thermal component is the key emission process
determining the spectral evolution. Even though bursts appear to have a variety
of, sometimes complex, spectral evolutions, the behaviors of the two separate
components are remarkably similar for all bursts, with the temperature
describing a broken power-law in time. The non-thermal component is consistent
with emission from a population of fast cooling electrons emitting
optically-thin synchrotron emission or non-thermal Compton radiation. This
indicates that these behaviors are the fundamental and characteristic ones for
gamma-ray bursts.",2005-04-20T20:00:32Z
"Outflows in Infrared-Luminous Starbursts at z < 0.5. I. Sample, NaI D
  Spectra, and Profile Fitting","We have conducted a spectroscopic survey of 78 starbursting infrared-luminous
galaxies at redshifts up to z = 0.5. We use moderate-resolution spectroscopy of
the NaI D interstellar absorption feature to directly probe the neutral phase
of outflowing gas in these galaxies. Over half of our sample are ultraluminous
infrared galaxies that are classified as starbursts; the rest have infrared
luminosities in the range log(L_IR/L_sun) = 10.2 - 12.0. The sample selection,
observations, and data reduction are described here. The absorption-line
spectra of each galaxy are presented. We also discuss the theory behind
absorption-line fitting in the case of a partially-covered, blended absorption
doublet observed at moderate-to-high resolution, a topic neglected in the
literature. A detailed analysis of these data is presented in a companion
paper.",2005-06-24T20:27:42Z
"Low-Energy Direct Capture in the 16O(alpha,gamma)20Ne Reaction","The cross section of the 16O(a,g)20Ne capture reaction is analyzed at low
energies where the direct capture mechanism is dominant. For temperatures below
T9 = 0.2 the resulting astrophysical reaction rate is about a factor of two
higher than in a recent compilation whereas the energy dependence of the
astrophysical S-factor and the branching ratios to the 20Ne bound states are
very similar to previous calculations. The validity of the widely used detailed
balance theorem for the inverse 20Ne(g,a)16O photodisintegration rate is
confirmed for the special case of high-lying first excited states.",2005-07-28T17:17:32Z
"Spectra of black-hole binaries in the low/hard state: from radio to
  X-rays","We propose a jet model for the low/hard state of Galactic black-hole X-ray
sources that can explain the energy spectra from radio to X-rays. The model
assumes that i) there is a magnetic field along the axis of the jet; ii) the
electron density in the jet drops inversely proportional to distance; and iii)
the electrons in the jet follow a power law distribution function. We have
performed Monte Carlo simulations of Compton upscattering of soft photons from
the accretion disk and have found power-law high-energy spectra with
photon-number index in the range 1.5 - 2 and cutoff at a few hundred keV. The
spectrum at long wavelengths (radio, infrared, optical) is modeled to come from
synchrotron radiation of the energetic electrons in the jet. We find flat to
inverted radio spectra that extend from the radio up to about the optical band.
For magnetic field strengths of the order of 10^5-10^6G at the base of the jet,
the calculated spectra agree well in slope and flux with the observations. Our
model has the advantage over other existing models that it also explains many
of the existing timing data such as the time lag spectra, the hardening of the
power density spectra and the narrowing of the autocorrelation function with
increasing photon energy.",2005-04-07T12:31:02Z
Identifying Lenses with Small-Scale Structure. II. Fold Lenses,"When the source in a 4-image gravitational lens lies close to a ""fold""
caustic, two of the lensed images lie close together. If the lens potential is
smooth on the scale of the separation between the two close images, then the
difference between their fluxes should approximately vanish, Rfold =
(F1-F2)/(F1+F2) \approx 0. Violations of this ""fold relation"" in observed
lenses are thought to indicate the presence of structure on scales smaller than
the separation between the close images. We study the fold relation and find it
to be more subtle and rich than was previously realized. The degree to which
Rfold can differ from zero for realistic smooth lenses depends not only on the
distance of the source from the caustic, but also on its location along the
caustic, and on the angular structure of the lens potential. Thus, it is
impossible to say from Rfold alone whether observed flux ratios are anomalous
or not. Instead, we must consider the full distribution of Rfold values that
can be obtained from smooth potentials that reproduce the separation between
the two close images and the distance to the next nearest image. We analyze the
generic and specific features of this distribution, and then show that 5 of the
12 known lenses with fold configurations have flux ratio anomalies: B0712+472,
SDSS 0924+0219, PG 1115+080, B1555+375, and B1933+503. Combining this with our
previous analysis revealing anomalies in 3 of the 4 known lenses with cusp
configurations, we conclude that at least half (8/16) of all 4-image lenses
that admit generic, local analyses exhibit flux ratio anomalies indicative of
small-scale structure. The fold and cusp relations do not reveal the nature of
the implied small-scale structure, but do provide the formal foundation for
substructure studies. [Abridged]",2005-03-21T21:01:04Z
"Power Spectrum Analysis of Far-IR Background Fluctuations in Spitzer
  Maps at 160 Microns","We describe data reduction and analysis of fluctuations in the Cosmic Far-IR
Background (CFIB) in large maps observed with the Multiband Imaging Photometer
for Spitzer (MIPS) instrument 160 micron detectors. We analyzed the
extragalactic First Look Survey (FLS) and the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared
Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) Lockman Hole observations, the latter being the
largest low-cirrus mapping observation available. In the Lockman Hole map, we
measured the power spectrum of the CFIB by fitting a power law to the IR cirrus
component, the dominant foreground contaminant, and subtracting this cirrus
signal. The CFIB power spectrum at mid-high k (k ~ 0.2 - 0.5 arc min^-1) is
consistent with previous measurements of a relatively flat component. At lower
k, however, the power spectrum is clearly not flat, decreasing from our lowest
frequencies (k ~ 0.03 arc min^-1) and flattening at mid-frequencies (k ~ 0.1 -
0.2 arc min^-1). This behavior is consistent with the gross characteristics of
predictions of a source clustering signature in CFIB power spectra, and this is
the first report of such a detection.",2005-04-07T00:44:33Z
Evidence of Orbital Motion in the Binary Brown Dwarf Kelu-1AB,"We have resolved Kelu-1 into a binary system with a separation of ~290 mas
using the Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics system on the Keck II telescope. We
have also re-analyzed a 1998 HST observation of Kelu-1 and find that the
observed PSF is best fit by a binary object separated by 45 mas. Observations
on multiple epochs confirm the two objects share a common proper motion and
clearly demonstrate the first evidence of orbital motion. Kelu-1B is fainter
than Kelu-1A by 0.39+/-0.01 magnitudes in the K' filter and 0.50+/-0.01
magnitudes in the H filter. We derive spectral types of L2+/-1 and L3.5+/-1 for
Kelu-1A and B, respectively. The separation of flux into the two components
rectifies Kelu-1's over-luminosity problem that has been known for quite some
time. Given the available data we are able to constrain the inclination of the
system to >81 degrees and the orbital period to >~40 years.",2005-08-05T19:35:33Z
"Evidence for dust reddening in DLAs identified through CaII H&K
  absorption","We present a new sample of 31 CaII(H&K) 3935,3970 absorption line systems
with 0.84<z_abs<1.3 discovered in the spectra of Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 3 quasars, together with an analysis of their dust content.
The presence of Calcium absorption together with measurements of the MgII 2796,
FeII 2600 and MgI 2853 lines lead to the conclusion that the majority of our
systems are Damped Ly-alpha (DLA) absorbers. The composite spectrum in the rest
frame of the absorber shows clear evidence for reddening. Large and Small
Magellanic Cloud extinction curves provide satisfactory fits, with a best-fit
E(B-V) of 0.06, while the Galactic dust extinction curve provides a poor fit
due to the lack of a strong 2175A feature. A trend of increasing dust content
with equivalent width of CaII is present. Monte Carlo techniques demonstrate
that the detection of reddening is significant at >99.99% confidence. The
discovery of significant amounts of dust in a subsample of DLAs has direct
implications for studies of the metallicity evolution of the universe and the
nature of DLAs in relation to high redshift galaxies. The gas:dust ratio is
discussed. Our results suggest that at least ~40% of the CaII absorption
systems are excluded from the magnitude-limited SDSS quasar sample as a result
of the associated extinction, a fraction similar to the upper limit deduced at
higher redshifts from radio-selected surveys.",2005-05-02T20:04:00Z
"Quantifying orbital migration from exoplanet statistics and host
  metallicities","We investigate how the statistical distribution of extrasolar planets may be
combined with knowledge of the host stars' metallicity to yield constraints on
the migration histories of gas giant planets. At any radius, planets that
barely manage to form around the lowest metallicity stars accrete their
envelopes just as the gas disk is being dissipated, so the lower envelope of
planets in a plot of metallicity vs semi-major axis defines a sample of
non-migratory planets that will have suffered less than average migration
subsequent to gap opening. Under the assumption that metallicity largely
controls the initial surface density of planetesimals, we use simplified core
accretion models to calculate how the minimum metallicity needed for planet
formation varies as a function of semi-major axis. Models that do not include
core migration prior to gap opening (Type I migration) predict that the
critical metallicity is largely flat between the snow line and a semimajor axis
of about 6 AU, with a weak dependence on the initial surface density profile of
planetesimals. When slow Type I migration is included, the critical metallicity
is found to increase steadily from 1-10 AU. Large planet samples, that include
planets at modestly greater orbital radii than present surveys, therefore have
the potential to quantify the extent of migration in both Type I and Type II
regimes.",2005-05-30T20:00:17Z
The fundamental plane of isolated early-type galaxies,"Here we present new measurements of effective radii, surface brightnesses and
internal velocity dispersions for 23 isolated early-type galaxies. The
photometric properties are derived from new multi-colour imaging of 10
galaxies, whereas the central kinematics for 7 galaxies are taken from
forthcoming work by Hau & Forbes. These are supplemented with data from the
literature. We reproduce the colour-magnitude and Kormendy relations and
strengthen the result of Paper I that isolated galaxies follow the same
photometric relations as galaxies in high density environments. We also find
that some isolated galaxies reveal fine structure indicative of a recent merger
while others appear undisturbed. We examine the Fundamental Plane in both
traditional R_e, mu_e and sigma space and also kappa-space. Most isolated
galaxies follow the same Fundamental Plane tilt and scatter for galaxies in
high density environments. However, a few galaxies notably deviate from the
plane in the sense of having smaller M/L ratios. This can be understood in
terms of their younger stellar populations, which are presumably induced by a
gaseous merger. Overall, isolated galaxies have similar properties to those in
roups and clusters with a slight enhancement in the frequency of recent
mergers/interactions.",2005-05-12T18:32:02Z
GZK cutoff distortion due to the energy error distribution shape,"The observed energy spectrum of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is
distorted by errors in the energy reconstruction. Here we show that if the
shape of the error distribution is lognormal, the high end of the cosmic ray
spectrum will be distorted. This is distinct and potentially more significant
than the effect of the magnitude of the error in the energy. We estimate the
UHECR spectrum at the Earth assuming it is originated from a cosmological flux.
We then convolute this flux assuming a lognormal error in the energy. We show
that if the standard deviation of the lognormal error distribution is equal or
larger than 0.25, both the shape and the normalization of the measured energy
spectra will be modified significantly. As a consequence the GZK cutoff might
be sufficiently smeared and as not to be seen. This result is independent of
the power law of the cosmological flux. As a conclusion we show that in order
to establish the presence or not of the GZK feature, not only more data is
needed but also that the shape of the energy error distribution has to be known
well.",2005-04-04T22:22:28Z
Internal dynamics of the z sim 0.8 cluster RX J0152.7-1357,"We present the results from the dynamical analysis of the cluster of galaxies
RX J0152-1357, which shows a complex structure in its X-ray emission, with two
major clumps in the central region, and a third clump in the Eastern region.
Our analysis is based on redshift data for 187 galaxies. We compute the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion of galaxies, sigma_V=1322^+74_-68 kms^-1,
which is significantly larger than what is expected in the case of a relaxed
cluster with an observed X-ray temperature of 5-6 keV. We find evidence that
this cluster is far from dynamical equilibrium, as shown by the non Gaussianity
of the velocity distribution, the presence of a velocity gradient and
significant substructure. Our analysis shows that the high value of sigma_V is
due to the complex structure of RX J0152-1357, i.e. to the presence of three
galaxy clumps of different mean velocity. Using optical data we detect a
low-velocity clump (with sigma_V=300-500 kms^-1) in the central SW region and a
high--velocity clump (with sigma_V sim 700 kms^-1) in the E region, well
corresponding to the SW and E peaks detected in the X-ray emission. The central
NE X-ray peak is associated to the main galaxy structure with a velocity which
is intermediate between those of the other two clumps and sigma_V sim 900
kms^-1. The mass of the whole system within 2 Mpc is estimated to lie in the
range (1.2-2.2)X10^{15} M_sun. Analytic calculations based on the two-body
model indicate that the system is most likely bound, currently undergoing
merging. In particular, we suggest that the SW clump is not a small group, but
rather the dense cluster-core of a massive cluster.",2005-06-09T16:49:06Z
"Three-Dimensional Numerical Simulations of Thermal-Gravitational
  Instability in Protogalactic Halo Environment","We study thermal-gravitational instability in simplified models for
protogalactic halos using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The
simulations followed the evolution of gas with radiative cooling down to T =
10^4 K, background heating, and self-gravity. Then cooled and condensed clouds
were identified and their physical properties were examined in detail. During
early stage clouds start to form around initial density peaks by thermal
instability. Small clouds appear first and they are pressure-bound.
Subsequently, the clouds grow through compression by the background pressure as
well as gravitational infall. During late stage cloud-cloud collisions become
important, and clouds grow mostly through gravitational merging.
Gravitationally bound clouds with mass M_c > ~6 X 10^6 Msun are found in the
late stage. They are approximately in virial equilibrium and have radius R_c =
\~150 - 200 pc. Those clouds have gained angular momentum through tidal torque
as well as merging, so they have large angular momentum with the spin parameter
<lambda_s> ~ 0.3. The clouds formed in a denser background tend to have smaller
spin parameters. We discuss briefly the implications of our results on the
formation of protoglobular cluster clouds in protogalactic halos. (abridged)",2005-06-08T05:46:35Z
The core of the Canis Major galaxy as traced by Red Clump stars,"The recently-discovered stellar system in Canis Major is analysed using
He-burning Red Clump stars as tracers. Canis Major turns out to be the
strongest and most spatially confined overdensity of the whole Galactic Disc,
both in terms of number density and of statistical significance. When projected
onto the Galactic Plane, it appears as an elongated and compact overdensity
extending from l ~ 200 to l ~ 280 with a roundish core toward l ~ 240. We find
that the main body of the system has an integrated absolute magnitude M_V=-14.4
+/- 0.8, a central surface brightness \mu_{V,0} = 24.0 +/- 0.6 mag/arcsec^2 and
a line-of-sight profile peaked at D_{sun}=7.2 +/- 1.0 kpc with Half Width at
Half Maximum ~ 2.0 kpc, in excellent agreement with the results obtained with
widely different tracers (M giants and Main Sequence stars) in previous
analyses. The mean distance to the main body of Canis Major is observed to
increase with increasing Galactic longitude, from D_{sun} ~ 6.3 kpc at l ~ 225,
to D_{sun} ~ 9.3 kpc at l ~ 265, in good agreement with the predictions of our
more recent N-body simulation that models CMa as a dwarf galaxy being accreted
in a planar orbit onto the disc of the Milky Way. We confirm that the Canis
Major system has all the characteristics of the relic of a dwarf galaxy seen on
top of a large-scale overdensity that we detect all over the third and fourth
Galactic quadrants (180<l<360, with a strong maximum around l=290 and b> -5)

"GRBs and SGRs by high energy leptons showering in blazing gamma jets:
  are SGRs sources of EeV CRs?","The apparently huge energy budget of the gamma ray burst GRB 990123 led to
the final collapse of the isotropic fireball model, forcing even the most
skeptical to consider a beamed Jet emission correlated to a supernova (SN)
explosion. Similarly the surprising giant flare from the soft gamma repeater
SGR 1806-20 that occurred on 2004 December 27, may induce the crisis of the
magnetar model. If the apparently huge energy associated to this flare has been
radiated isotropically, the magnetar should have consumed at once most of (if
not all) the energy stored in the magnetic field. On the contrary we think that
a thin collimated precessing jet, blazing on-axis, may be the source of such
apparently huge bursts with a moderate output power. We discuss the possible
role of the synchrotron emission and electromagnetic showering of PeV electron
pairs from muon bundles. A jet made of muons may play a key role in avoiding
the opacity of the SN-GRB radiation field. We propose a similar mechanism to
explain the emission of SGRs. In this case we also examine the possibility of a
primary hadronic jet that would produce ultra relativistic e+ e- (1 - 10 PeV)
from pion- muon or neutron decay. Such electron pairs would emit a few hundreds
keV radiation from their interaction with the galactic magnetic field, as it is
observed in the intense gamma ray flare from SGR 1806-20. A thin precessing jet
from a pulsar may naturally explain the negligible variation of the spin
frequency. A correlation between SGR 1806-20, SGR 1900 +14, Cygnus and the
AGASA excess of EeV cosmic rays (CRs) has been found; we suggest that a robust
EeV signal may be detected by AUGER or Milagro in the near future.",2005-04-28T16:20:35Z
The heavy elements mixture and the stellar cluster age,"Recent analyses of solar spectroscopic data (see Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval
2004 and references therein) suggest a significative variation of the heavy
elements abundance. The change of heavy mixture might affect the determination
of the clusters age for two different reasons: the change of theoretical
isochrones at fixed metallicity and the variation of the inferred cluster
metallicity from the observed [Fe/H]. The first point is analyzed discussing
the effects of updating the metal distribution on theoretical evolutionary
tracks and isochrones for metallicities suitable for the galactic globular and
open clusters and for the bulk population of the Large Magellanic Clouds. The
maximum variation of the estimated age ($\approx$0.5 Gyr), although not
negligible, is still within the present uncertainty. The second point is
addressed by comparing present theoretical predictions with the very precise
observational data of the Hyades cluster from the Hypparcos satellite.",2005-04-27T18:40:15Z
"The Piecewise Parabolic Method for Multidimensional Relativistic Fluid
  Dynamics","We present an extension of the Piecewise Parabolic Method to special
relativistic fluid dynamics in multidimensions. The scheme is conservative,
dimensionally unsplit, and suitable for a general equation of state. Temporal
evolution is second-order accurate and employs characteristic projection
operators; spatial interpolation is piece-wise parabolic making the scheme
third-order accurate in smooth regions of the flow away from discontinuities.
The algorithm is written for a general system of orthogonal curvilinear
coordinates and can be used for computations in non-cartesian geometries. A
non-linear iterative Riemann solver based on the two-shock approximation is
used in flux calculation. In this approximation, an initial discontinuity
decays into a set of discontinuous waves only implying that, in particular,
rarefaction waves are treated as flow discontinuities. We also present a new
and simple equation of state which approximates the exact result for the
relativistic perfect gas with high accuracy. The strength of the new method is
demonstrated in a series of numerical tests and more complex simulations in
one, two and three dimensions.",2005-05-10T16:30:05Z
"Astrophysical Production of Microscopic Black Holes in a Low
  Planck-scale World","In the framework of brane-world models lowering the Planck scale to the TeV
range, it has recently been pointed out that small black holes could be formed
at particle colliders or by neutrinos interactions in the atmosphere. This
article aims at reviewing other places and epochs where microscopic black holes
could be formed : the interstellar medium and the early Universe. The related
decay channels and the propagation of the emitted particles are studied to
conclude that, in spite of the large creation rate for such black holes, the
amount of produced particles do not conflict with experimental data. This
shows, from the astronomical viewpoint, that models with large extra dimensions
making the gravity scale much lower are compatible with observations.",2005-05-20T13:18:34Z
Chandra Observations of the Interacting Galaxies NGC 3395/3396 (Arp 270),"In this paper we present the results of a 20 ks high resolution Chandra X-ray
observation of the peculiar galaxy pair NGC 3395/3396, a system at a very early
stage of merging, and less evolved than the famous Antennae and Mice merging
systems. Previously unpublished ROSAT HRI data are also presented. The point
source population and the hot diffuse gas in this system are investigated, and
compared with other merging galaxy pairs. 16 X-ray point sources are detected
in Arp 270, 7 of which are classified as ULXs (Lx > 10^39 erg/s). From spectral
fits and the age of the system it seems likely that these are predominantly
high mass X-ray binaries. The diffuse gas emits at a global temperature of ~0.5
keV, consistent with temperatures observed in other interacting systems, and we
see no evidence of the starburst-driven hot gaseous outflows seen in more
evolved systems such as The Mice and The Antennae. It is likely that these
features are absent from Arp 270 as the gas has had insufficient time to break
out of the galaxy disks. 32% of the luminosity of Arp 270 arises from the
diffuse gas in the system, this is low when compared to later stage merging
systems and gives further credence that this is an early stage merger.
Comparing the ULX population of Arp 270 to other merging systems, we derive a
relationship between the star formation rate of the system, indicated by Lfir,
and the number (N(ULX)) and luminosity (Lulx) of its ULX population. We find
Nulx proportional to Lfir^0.18 and Lulx proportional to Lfir^0.54. These
relationships, coupled with the relation of the point source X-ray luminosity
(Lxp) to Lk and Lfir+uv (Colbert et al. 2003), indicate that the ULX sources in
an interacting system have contributions from both the old and young stellar
populations.",2005-04-12T21:43:08Z

of the emission line nebulae in the compact steep spectrum radio sources 3C 67,
3C 277.1, and 3C 303.1. We derive BPT (Baldwin- Philips-Terlevich; Baldwin et
al. 1981) diagnostic emission line ratios for the nebulae which are consistent
with a mix of shock excitation and photoionization in the extended gas. In
addition, line ratios indicative of lower ionization gas are found to be
associated with higher gas velocities. The results are consistent with a
picture in which these galaxy scale radio sources interact with dense clouds in
the interstellar medium of the host galaxies, shocking the clouds thereby
ionizing and accelerating them.",2005-04-14T15:47:02Z
Which Massive stars are Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors?,"The collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts requires three essential
ingredients: a massive core, removal of the hydrogen envelope, and enough
angular momentum in the core. We study current massive star evolution models of
solar metallicity to determine which massive star physics is capable of
producing these ingredients. In particular, we investigate the role of
hydrodynamic and magnetic internal angular momentum transport and binary mass
and angular momentum transfer. We follow the evolution of rotating single stars
and of binary systems that include rotational processes for both stars.
Neglecting magnetic fields, we show that the cores of massive single stars can
maintain a high specific angular momentum when evolved with the assumption that
mean molecular weight gradients suppress rotational mixing processes. In binary
systems that undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning the mass
receiving star accretes large amounts of high angular momentum material,
leading to a spin-up of the core. We find, however, that this merely
compensates for the tidal angular momentum loss due to spin-orbit coupling,
which leads to synchronous rotation before the mass transfer event. Therefore
the resulting cores do not rotate faster than in single stars. We also present
models that include magnetic fields generated by differential rotation and we
consider the internal angular momentum transport by magnetic torques. We
investigate the capability of magnetic torques to efficiently pump angular
momentum into the cores of accreting stars. Despite our finding that this
mechanism works, the magnetic coupling of core and envelope after the accreting
star ends core hydrogen burning leads to slower rotation than in the
non-magnetic case.",2005-04-07T10:43:51Z

Neutron Catalysis of Resonance Fusion in Stellar Matter,"Within the framework of resonance fusion study in stellar matter the features
of system consisted of two alpha particles and one neutron have been
investigated at astrophysical energies. Consideration of three body scattering
has been carried out on base of well-known Faddeev's equations. It is found
that under certain conditions the series of resonance states appear in this
system at very low energies. The lifetimes of these three body resonances are
close to the lifetime of unstable nucleus 8Be. The simple forms of two body
repulsive potentials are taken into account to describe the parameters of the
alpha, alpha resonance and to satisfy n, alpha scattering data at very low
energies. The explanation of resonance phenomena in n, alpha, alpha system is
offered on base of physical model. The effect results from resonance quantum
phenomena in few body dynamics. In turn, the resonance fusion can give
influence on many astrophysical phenomena. The possibility of catalyzing this
new mode of fusion by free neutrons in alpha particle matter is considered too.",2005-06-29T17:14:31Z
"Evolution of rapidly rotating metal-poor massive stars towards gamma-ray
  bursts","Recent models of rotating massive stars including magnetic fields prove it
difficult for the cores of single stars to retain enough angular momentum to
produce a collapsar and gamma-ray burst. At low metallicity, even very massive
stars may retain a massive hydrogen envelope due to the weakness of the stellar
winds, posing an additional obstacle to the collapsar model. Here, we consider
the evolution of massive, magnetic stars where rapid rotation induces almost
chemically homogeneous evolution. We find that in this case, the requirements
of the collapsar model are rather easily fulfilled if the metallicity
sufficiently small: 1) Rapidly rotating helium stars are formed without the
need to remove the hydrogen envelope, avoiding mass-loss induced spin-down. 2)
Angular momentum transport from the helium core to hydrogen envelope by
magnetic torques is insignificant. We demonstrate this by calculating
evolutionary models of massive stars with various metallicities, and derive an
upper metallicity limit for this scenario based on currently proposed mass loss
rates. Our models also suggest the existence of a lower CO-core mass limit of
about 10 Msun -- which relates to an initial mass of only about 20 Msun within
our scenario -- for GRB production. We argue that the relative importance of
the considered GRB progenitor channel, compared to any channel related to
binary stars, may increase with decreasing metallicity, and that this channel
might be the major path to GRBs from first stars.",2005-08-10T17:19:01Z
On the nature of X-Ray Flashes,"We discuss the origin of X-Ray Flashes (XRFs), a recently discovered class of
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). Using a simplified model for internal shocks we check
if XRFs can be intrinsically soft due to some specific values of the parameters
describing the relativistic outflow emerging from the central engine. We
generate a large number of synthetic events and find that XRFs are obtained
when the contrast Gamma_max/Gamma_min of the Lorentz factor distribution is
small while the average Lorentz factor Gamma is large. A few XRFs may be GRBs
at large redshifts but we exclude this possibility for the bulk of the
population. If outflows with a small contrast are commonly produced, even a
large population of XRFs could be explained. If conversely the Lorentz factor
distribution within the wind is broad, one should then rely on extrinsic
causes, such as viewing angle effects or high redshift.",2005-07-07T15:23:19Z
"Smoothed Particle Inference: A Kilo-Parametric Method for X-ray Galaxy
  Cluster Modeling","We propose an ambitious new method that models the intracluster medium in
clusters of galaxies as a set of X-ray emitting smoothed particles of plasma.
Each smoothed particle is described by a handful of parameters including
temperature, location, size, and elemental abundances. Hundreds to thousands of
these particles are used to construct a model cluster of galaxies, with the
appropriate complexity estimated from the data quality. This model is then
compared iteratively with X-ray data in the form of adaptively binned photon
lists via a two-sample likelihood statistic and iterated via Markov Chain Monte
Carlo. The complex cluster model is propagated through the X-ray instrument
response using direct sampling Monte Carlo methods. Using this approach the
method can reproduce many of the features observed in the X-ray emission in a
less assumption-dependent way that traditional analyses, and it allows for a
more detailed characterization of the density, temperature, and metal abundance
structure of clusters. Multi-instrument X-ray analyses and simultaneous X-ray,
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ), and lensing analyses are a straight-forward extension
of this methodology. Significant challenges still exist in understanding the
degeneracy in these models and the statistical noise induced by the complexity
of the models.",2005-07-26T17:59:53Z
Multicomponent Decompositions for a Sample of S0 galaxies,"We have estimated the bulge-to-total ($B/T$) light ratios in the $K_s$-band
for a sample of 24 S0, S0/a and Sa galaxies by applying a 2-dimensional
multicomponent decomposition method. For the disk an exponential function is
used, the bulges are fitted by a S\'ersic's $R^{1/n}$ function and the bars and
ovals are described either by a S\'ersic or a Ferrers function. In order to
avoid non-physical solutions, preliminary characterization of the structural
components is made by inspecting the radial profiles of the orientation
parameters and the low azimuthal wavenumber Fourier amplitudes and phases. In
order to identify also the inner structures, unsharp masks were created:
previously undetected inner spiral arms were found in NGC 1415 and marginally
in NGC 3941. Most importantly, we found that S0s have a mean $<B/T>_K$-ratio of
0.24 $\pm$ 0.11, which is significantly smaller than the mean $<B/T>_R$ = 0.6
generally reported in the literature. Also, the surface brightness profiles of
the bulges in S0s were found to be more exponential-like than generally
assumed, the mean shape parameter of the bulge being $<n>$ = 2.1 $\pm$ 0.7. We
did not find examples of barred S0s lacking the disk component, but we found
some galaxies (NGC 718, NGC 1452, NGC 4608) having a non-exponential disk in
the bar region. To our knowledge our study is the first attempt to apply a
multicomponent decomposition method for a moderately sized sample of early-type
disk galaxies",2005-08-03T07:43:24Z
RRAB Variables and Metallicity,"A preliminary analysis of the UBV light curves of RR AB variables revealed
that they contain information on the metallicities of these stars. The computed
parameters which correlate with metallicity are given in the tables for 99 RR
AB stars including 12 variables without previously determined metallicities.",2005-05-11T07:52:34Z
Evolution of Low-Mass Population III Stars,"We present the evolutionary models of metal-free stars in the mass range from
0.8 to 1.2 Msun with up-to-date input physics. The evolution is followed to the
onset of hydrogen mixing into a convection, driven by the helium flash at red
giant or asymptotic giant branch phase.
  The models of mass M >= 0.9 Msun undergo the central hydrogen flash,
triggered by the carbon production due to the 3-alpha reactions.
  We find that the border of the off-center and central ignition of helium core
flash falls between 1.1 and 1.2 Msun; the models of mass M <= 1.1 Msun
experience the hydrogen mixing at the tip of red giant branch while the models
of M = 1.2 Msun during the helium shell flashes on the asymptotic giant branch.
  The equation of state for the Coulomb liquid region, where electron
conduction and radiation compete, is shown to be important since it affects the
thermal state in the helium core and influences the red giant branch evolution.
  It is also found that the non-resonant term of 3-alpha reactios plays an
important role, although it has negligible effect in the evolution of stars of
younger populations.
  We compare our models with the computations by several other sets of authors,
to confirm the good agreement except for one study which finds the helium
ignition much closer to the center with consequences important for subsequent
evolution.",2005-04-25T15:22:31Z
Multi-Thread Hydrodynamic Modeling of a Solar Flare,"Past hydrodynamic simulations have been able to reproduce the high
temperatures and densities characteristic of solar flares. These simulations,
however, have not been able to account for the slow decay of the observed flare
emission or the absence of blueshifts in high spectral resolution line
profiles. Recent work has suggested that modeling a flare as an sequence of
independently heated threads instead of as a single loop may resolve the
discrepancies between the simulations and observations. In this paper we
present a method for computing multi-thread, time-dependent hydrodynamic
simulations of solar flares and apply it to observations of the Masuda flare of
1992 January 13. We show that it is possible to reproduce the temporal
evolution of high temperature thermal flare plasma observed with the
instruments on the \textit{GOES} and \textit{Yohkoh} satellites. The results
from these simulations suggest that the heating time-scale for a individual
thread is on the order of 200 s. Significantly shorter heating time scales (20
s) lead to very high temperatures and are inconsistent with the emission
observed by \textit{Yohkoh}.",2005-07-13T16:49:02Z
Can Cosmic Rays Heat the Intergalactic Medium?,"Supernova explosions in the early star forming galaxies will accelerate
cosmic rays (CRs). CRs are typically confined in the collapsed objects for a
short period before escaping into the intergalactic medium (IGM). Galactic
outflows can facilitate this escape by advecting CRs into the IGM. An outflow
that results in a termination shock can also generate more CRs. We show that
the CR protons from the above processes can significantly affect the thermal
history of the IGM. Within plausible range of parameters, cosmic ray heating
can compensate for adiabatic cooling and explain the measured IGM temperature
at redshifts z between 2 to 4, even with early reionization.",2005-05-30T07:29:42Z
Finding the Electromagnetic Counterparts of Cosmological Standard Sirens,"The gravitational waves (GW) emitted during the coalescence of supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) in the mass range 10^4-10^7 M_sun will be detectable out to
high redshifts with LISA. We calculate the size and orientation of the
three-dimensional error ellipse in solid angle and redshift within which the
LISA event could be localized using the GW signatures alone. We take into
account uncertainties in LISA's measurements of the luminosity distance and
direction to the source, in the background cosmology, in weak gravitational
lensing magnification due to inhomogeneities along the line of sight, and
potential source peculiar velocities. We find that weak lensing errors exceed
other sources of uncertainties by nearly an order of magnitude. Under the
plausible assumption that BH mergers are accompanied by gas accretion leading
to Eddington-limited quasar activity, we then compute the number of quasars
that would be found in a typical LISA error volume, as a function of BH mass
and redshift. We find that low redshifts offer the best opportunities to
identify quasar counterparts to cosmological standard sirens, and that the LISA
error volume will typically contain a single near-Eddington quasar at z=1. This
will allow a straightforward test of the hypothesis that BH mergers are
accompanied by bright quasar activity and, if the hypothesis proves correct,
will guarantee the identification of a unique quasar counterpart. This would
yield unprecedented tests of the physics of SMBH accretion, and offer an
alternative method to precisely constrain cosmological parameters [abridged].",2005-05-19T15:07:15Z
The Afterglows of Ultraluminous Quasars,"Quasars represent a brief phase in the life-cycle of most massive galaxies,
but the evolutionary connection between central black holes and their host
galaxies remains unclear. While quasars are active and shining brighter than
the Compton-limit luminosity, their radiation heats the surrounding medium to
the Compton temperature, forming Compton spheres extending to the Str\""omgren
radius of Fe$^{26+}$/He$^{2+}$. After the quasars shut off, their ``afterglow''
can be detected through three signatures: (1) an extended X-ray envelope, with
a characteristic temperature of $\sim 3\times 10^7$ K; (2) Ly$\alpha$ and
Ly$\beta$ lines and the $K-$edge of Fe$^{26+}$; and (3) nebulosity from
hydrogen and helium recombination emission lines. We discuss the possibility of
detecting these signatures using {\em Chandra}, the planned {\em XEUS} mission,
and ground-based optical telescopes. The luminosity and size of quasar
afterglows can be used to constrain the lifetime of quasars.",2005-04-14T01:04:32Z
Bounds on Cosmic Strings from WMAP and SDSS,"We find the constraints from WMAP and SDSS data on the fraction of
cosmological fluctuations sourced by local cosmic strings using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. In addition to varying the usual 6 cosmological
parameters and the string tension ($\mu$), we also varied the amount of
small-scale structure on the strings. Our results indicate that cosmic strings
can account for up to 7 (14)% of the total power of the microwave anisotropy at
68 (95)% confidence level. The corresponding bound on the string mass per unit
length, within our string model, is $G\mu < 1.8 (2.7) \times 10^{-7}$ at 68
(95)% c.l., where this constraint has been altered from what appears below
following the correction of errors in our cosmic string code outlined in a
recent erratum, astro-ph/0604141. We also calculate the B-type polarization
spectra sourced by cosmic strings and discuss the prospects of their detection.",2005-03-16T18:30:30Z
TeV Dark Matter detection by Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes,"Ground based Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes have recently unveiled a TeV
gamma-ray signal from the direction of the Galactic Centre. We examine whether
these gamma-rays, observed by the VERITAS, CANGAROO-II and HESS collaborations,
may arise from annihilations of dark matter particles. Emission from nearby
dwarf spheroidals, such as Sagittarius, could provide a test of this scenario.",2005-05-19T17:00:02Z
"Molecular Hydrogen in Orion as Observed by the Far Ultraviolet
  Spectroscopic Explorer","Diffuse far-ultraviolet stellar emission scattered by dust grains has been
observed in a region near the Orion Nebula. In addition to the scattered
stellar continuum, emission and absorption features produced by molecular
hydrogen have been identified. In this Letter, we present an analysis of this
absorption and fluorescent emission from molecular hydrogen in Orion. We model
the spectra obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer using
optical depth templates and a fluorescent emission code. These results are
surprising because previous studies have found little ultraviolet absorption
from H_2 in this region, and the emission is coming from a seemingly empty part
of the nebula. We find that the emission fills in the observed absorption lines
where the two overlap. These data support the claim that fluorescent excitation
by ultraviolet photons is the primary mechanism producing the near-infrared
emission spectrum observed in the outer regions of the Orion Nebula.",2005-07-15T15:52:21Z
Molecular Gas in Compact Galaxies,"New observations of 11 compact galaxies in the 12CO J=2-1 and J=3-2
transitions and literature data have been used to construct accurate line
ratios in matched beams allowing LVG modelling of physical parameters. Fitting
a single gas component to observed line ratios tends to produce physically
unrealistic results, and is often not possible at all. Much better results are
obtained by modelling two distinct gas components. The molecular gas is usually
warm (T(kin)=50-150 K) and at least partially dense (n(H2)>3000 cm3). Most of
the gas-phase carbon in these galaxies is in atomic form; only a small fraction
(5%) is in carbon monoxide. Beam-averaged CO column densities are low,
typically 10(16) cm2 but molecular hydrogen column densities are high, of the
order of 10(22) cm2 and confirm large CO-to-H2 conversion factors, typically X
= 10(21)-10(22) cm2(K kms-1) found in low-metallicity environments by other
methods. From CO spectroscopy, three different types of molecular environment
are distinguished in compact galaxies. Type I (high rotational and isotopic
ratios) corresponds to hot and dense molecular clouds dominated by star-forming
regions. Type II has lower ratios, similar to the mean found for
infrared-luminous galaxies in general, and corresponds to environments engaged
in, but not dominated by, star-forming activity. Type III, characterized by low
12CO (2--1)/(1--0) ratios, corresponds to mostly inactive environments of
relatively low density.",2005-04-26T09:21:46Z
Power Spectrum Estimation II. Linear Maximum Likelihood,"This second paper of two companion papers on the estimation of power spectra
specializes to the topic of estimating galaxy power spectra at large, linear
scales using maximum likelihood methods. As in the first paper, the aims are
pedagogical, and the emphasis is on concepts rather than technical detail. The
paper covers most of the salient issues, including selection functions,
likelihood functions, Karhunen-Loeve compression, pair-integral bias, Local
Group flow, angular or radial systematics (arising for example from
extinction), redshift distortions, quadratic compression, decorrelation, and
disentanglement. The procedures are illustrated with results from the IRAS PSCz
survey. Most of the PSCz graphics included in this paper have not been
published elsewhere.",2005-03-29T01:49:17Z
"Effective equation of state for dark energy: mimicking quintessence and
  phantom energy through a variable Lambda","While there is mounting evidence in all fronts of experimental cosmology for
a non-vanishing dark energy component in the Universe, we are still far away
from understanding its ultimate nature. A fundamental cosmological constant,
Lambda, is the most natural candidate, but many dynamical mechanisms to
generate an effective Lambda have been devised which postulate the existence of
a peculiar scalar field (so-called quintessence, and generalizations thereof).
These models are essentially ad hoc, but they lead to the attractive
possibility of a time-evolving dark energy with a non-trivial equation of state
(EOS). Most, if not all, future experimental studies on precision cosmology
(e.g. the SNAP and PLANCK projects) address very carefully the determination of
an EOS parametrized ``a la quintessence''. Here we show that by fitting
cosmological data to an EOS of that kind can also be interpreted as a hint of a
fundamental, but time-evolving, cosmological term: Lambda=Lambda(t). We
exemplify this possibility by studying the effective EOS associated to a
renormalization group (RG) model for Lambda. We find that the effective EOS can
correspond to both normal quintessence and phantom dark energy, depending on
the value of a single parameter of the RG model. We conclude that behind a
non-trivial EOS of a purported quintessence or phantom scalar field there can
actually be a running cosmological term of a fundamental quantum field theory.",2005-05-06T18:28:51Z
"Long-Term Evolution of Supernova Remnants in Magnetized Interstellar
  Medium","The evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs) is studied, with particular
attention to the effect of magnetic fields with axisymmetric two-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical simulations. The evolution of magnetic SNRs is the same
as non-magnetic ones in the adiabatic Sedov stage. After a thin shell is
formed, the shell is driven by the pressure of the hot interior gas (bubble).
Evolution in the pressure-driven snow-plow phase is much affected by the
magnetic field. The shell sweeping the magnetic field lines thickens owing to
the magnetic pressure force. After $5\times 10^5{\rm yr}$ - $2\times 10^6{\rm
yr}$, the inner boundary of the thick shell begins to contract. This compresses
the hot bubble radially and maintains its thermal pressure. Thus, the bubble
forms a prolate spheroidal shape and becomes thinner and thinner, since it
expands in a direction parallel to the magnetic field for $B_0 \gtrsim 3\mu
{\rm G}$. Finally, the bubble contracts. The porosity of the hot low-density
gas in ISM is reduced, taking the effect of the magnetic field into account.",2005-07-19T19:31:51Z
"Testing the ""Dark-Energy""-Dominated Cosmology via the Solar-System
  Experiments","The effect of ""dark energy"" (i.e. the Lambda-term in Einstein equations) is
sought for at the interplanetary scales by comparing the rates of secular
increase in the lunar orbit obtained by two different ways: (1) measured
immediately by the laser ranging and (2) estimated independently from the
deceleration of the Earth's proper rotation. The first quantity involves both
the well-known effect of geophysical tides and the Kottler effect of
Lambda-term (i.e. a kind of the ""local"" Hubble expansion), while the second
quantity is associated only with the tidal influence. The difference between
them, 2.2 +/- 0.3 cm/yr, can be attributed just to the local Hubble expansion
with rate H_0^(loc) = 56 +/- 8 km/s/Mpc. Assuming that Hubble expansion is
formed locally only by the uniformly distributed dark energy (Lambda-term),
while globally also by a clumped substance (for the most part, the cold dark
matter), the total (large-scale) Hubble constant should be H_0 = 65 +/- 9
km/s/Mpc. This is in reasonable agreement both with the commonly-accepted WMAP
result, H_0 = 71 +/- 3.5 km/s/Mpc, and with the data on supernovae Ia
distribution. The above coincidence can serve as one more argument in favor of
the dark energy.",2005-07-16T03:02:31Z
"Evidence for Evolution or Bias in Host Extinctions of Type 1a Supernovae
  at High Redshift","Type 1a supernova magnitudes conventionally include an additive parameter
called the extinction coefficient. We find that the extinction coefficients of
a popular ``gold'' set are well correlated with the deviation of magnitudes
from Hubble diagrams. If the effect is due to bias, extinctions have been
overestimated, which makes supernovas appear more dim. The statistical
significance of the extinction-acceleration correlation has a random chance
probability of less than one in a million. The hypothesis that extinction
coefficients should be corrected empirically provides greatly improved fits to
both accelerating and non-accelerating models, with the independent feature of
eliminating any significant correlation of residuals.",2005-06-21T03:03:28Z
A Parameter-free Statistical Measurement of Halos with Power Spectra,"We show that, in the halo model of large-scale structure formation, the
difference between the Fourier and the DWT (discrete wavelet transform) power
spectra provides a statistical measurement of the halos. This statistical
quantity is free from parameters related to the shape of the mass profile and
the identification scheme of halos. That is, the statistical measurement is
invariant in the sense that models with reasonably defined and selected
parameters of the halo models should yield the same difference of the Fourier
and DWT spectra. This feature is useful to extract ensemble averaged properties
of halos, which cannot be obtained with the identification of individual halo.
To demonstrate this point, we show with WIGEON hydrodynamical simulation
samples that the spectrum difference provides a quantitative measurement of the
discrepancy of the distribution of baryonic gas from that of the underlying
dark matter field within halos. We also show that the mass density profile of
halos in physical space can be reconstructed with this statistical measurement.
This profile essentially is the average over an ensemble of halos, including
well virialized halos as well as halos with significant internal substructures.
Moreover, this reconstruction is sensitive to the tail of the mass density
profile. We showed that the profile with $1/r^3$ tail gives very different
result from that of $1/r^2$. Other possible applications of this method are
discussed as well.",2005-04-04T16:49:24Z
"Feeding the monster... the nucleus of NGC1097 at sub-arcsec scale in the
  IR with the VLT","Near-infrared images of the prototype LINER / Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 1097
observed with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) using adaptive optics disclose
with unprecedented detail a complex central network of filamentary structure
spiralling down to the center of the galaxy. The structure, consisting of
several spiral arms, some almost completing a revolution about the center, is
most prominent within the radius of about 300 pc. Some filaments can be traced
further out, where they seem to connect with the nuclear star-forming ring at
0.7 kpc radius. Straight principal shocks running along the primary large-scale
bar of NGC 1097, seen in the optical images as prominent dust lanes, curve into
this ring, but radio polarization vectors cross the nuclear ring under a rather
large angle. Here we attempt to explain this morphology in terms of
three-dimensional gas flow in a barred galaxy. In our scenario, parts of the
principal shock, which propagate in the off-plane gas, can cross the nuclear
star-forming ring, and excite waves inward from it. If the dispersion relation
of the excited waves allows for their propagation, they will naturally take the
shape of the observed central spiral. The nuclear region of NGC 1097 remains
unresolved at sub-arcsec scales in the near-IR, with an upper size limit of <10
pc FWHM. Thus, any putative central dusty torus or gaseosus disk envisaged by
the AGN unified schemes has to be smaller than 10 pc in diameter at near-IR
wavelengths. The extinction in the region between the nuclear star-forming ring
and the nucleus increases very moderately, reaching A_v~1 at the immediate
surrounding of the nucleus. Thus, if the nuclear filaments are tracing cold
dust, they contribute to a very low extinction in the line of sight and are
likely to be distributed in a rather thin disk.",2005-07-04T15:53:00Z
The X-ray Spectral Properties of SCUBA Galaxies,"Deep SCUBA surveys have uncovered a large population of massive submm
galaxies (SMGs) at z>~1. Although it is generally believed that these galaxies
host intense star-formation activity, there is growing evidence that a
substantial fraction also harbor an AGN. We present here possibly the strongest
evidence for this viewpoint to date: the combination of ultra-deep X-ray
observations (the 2 Ms CDF-N) and deep Keck spectroscopic data. We find that
the majority (~75%) of the spectroscopically identified SMGs host AGN activity;
the other ~25% have X-ray properties consistent with star formation (X-ray
derived SFRs of ~1300-2700 solars/yr). The AGNs have properties generally
consistent with those of nearby luminous AGNs (L_X~1E43-3E44) and the majority
(~80%) are heavily obscured. We construct composite rest-frame 2-20 keV spectra
for three different obscuration classes. An ~1 keV equivalent width FeK-alpha
emission line is seen in the composite X-ray spectrum of the most heavily
obscured AGNs (N_H>5x10^{23}), suggesting Compton-thick or near Compton-thick
absorption. Even taking into account the effects of absorption, we find that
the average X-ray-FIR ratio of the AGN-classified SMGs is approximately one
order of magnitude below that found for typical quasars. This result suggests
that intense star-formation activity dominates the bolometric output; however,
we also explore whether the X-ray-FIR ratio is intrinsically less than that
found for typical quasars and postulate that some SMGs may be AGN dominated. We
investigate the growth of massive black holes, discuss prospects for deeper
observations, and explore the potential of the next generation of X-ray
observatories. (ABRIDGED).",2005-06-27T12:07:21Z
Halo Geometry and Dark Matter Annihilation Signal,"We study the impact of the halo shape and geometry on the expected weakly
interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter annihilation signal from the
galactic center. As the halo profile in the innermost region is still poorly
constrained, we consider different density behaviors like flat cores, cusps and
spikes, as well as geometrical distortions. We show that asphericity has a
strong impact on the annihilation signal when the halo profile near the
galactic center is flat, but becomes gradually less significant for cuspy
profiles, and negligible in the presence of a central spike. However, the
astrophysical factor is strongly dependent on the WIMP mass and annihilation
cross-section in the latter case.",2005-04-28T13:38:53Z
"Changes in the global parameters of polytropic stars induced by the
  appearance of the soft core","The effect of a soft phase core appearance in the center of polytropic star
is analyzed by means of linear response theory. Approximate formulae for the
changes of radius, moment of inertia and mass-energy of non-rotating
configuration with arbitrary adiabatic indices are presented, followed by an
example evaluation of astrophysical observables.",2005-05-20T13:11:08Z
Weak lensing analysis in three dimensions,"We present a comprehensive full-sky 3-dimensional analysis of the
weak-lensing fields and their corresponding power spectra. Using the formalism
of spin-weight spherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions, we relate
the two-point statistics of the harmonic expansion coefficients of the weak
lensing shear and convergence to the power spectrum of the matter density
perturbations, and derive small-angle limits. Such a study is relevant in view
of the next generation of large-scale weak lensing surveys which will provide
distance information about the sources through photometric redshifts. This
opens up the possibility of accurate cosmological parameter estimation via weak
lensing, with an emphasis on the equation of state of dark energy.",2005-03-22T16:54:53Z
"Variability of Optical \ion{Fe}{ii} Complex in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
  Galaxy NGC 4051","The variability of optical FeII blends in NGC 4051 is examined from spectra
extracted from the AGN Watch program.In our analysis, the FeII complex are
subtracted and measured with the following results. Firstly, the FeII
variations were detected in NGC 4051 during a 3-year period. The identified
FeII variations followed the variations in continuum closely. Secondly, the EW
of FeII is reported to increase with the rising continuum flux, which is
consistent with previous claims that there is no convincing Baldwin Effect in
optical FeII. Thirdly, by comparing the variations of H$\beta$ and FeII, we
find that RFe scales with continuum flux as $\rm{R_{Fe}\propto (5.0\pm0.8)
\log(L/M)}$, which is significantly different from the theoretical
expectations. Finally, in six selected Seyferts, four out of five Narrow-Line
Seyfert 1 galaxies present positive correlation between RFe and the continuum
flux. The negative correlations are identified in the remaindng two objects
that have relatively broad profiles of H$\beta$ ($\rm{FWHM>1500 km\
s^{-1}}$).We argue that the difference of electron density of broad line clouds
and/or variability behavior of incident high-energy radiation can explain the
dichotomy in variability behavior of RFe.",2005-04-05T17:45:26Z
The Relationship between Class I and Class II Methanol Masers,"The Australia Telescope National Facility Mopra millimetre telescope has been
used to search for 95.1-GHz class I methanol masers towards sixty-two 6.6-GHz
class II methanol masers. A total of twenty-six 95.1-GHz masers were detected,
eighteen of these being new discoveries. Combining the results of this search
with observations reported in the literature, a near complete sample of
sixty-six 6.6-GHz class II methanol masers has been searched in the 95.1-GHz
transition, with detections towards 38 per cent (twenty-five detections ; not
all of the sources studied in this paper qualify for the complete sample, and
some of the sources in the sample were not observed in the present
observations). There is no evidence of an anti-correlation between either the
velocity range, or peak flux density of the class I and II transitions,
contrary to suggestions from previous studies. The majority of class I methanol
maser sources have a velocity range that partially overlaps with the class II
maser transitions. The presence of a class I methanol maser associated with a
class II maser source is not correlated with the presence (or absence) of
main-line OH or water masers. Investigations of the properties of the infrared
emission associated with the maser sources shows no significant difference
between those class II methanol masers with an associated class I maser and
those without. This may be consistent with the hypothesis that the objects
responsible for driving class I methanol masers are generally not those that
produce main-line OH, water or class II methanol masers.",2005-03-15T04:35:27Z
AGN Unification and the X-ray Background,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) unification, which implies a large number of
obscured AGN, can explain the optical, infrared and X-ray content of deep
multiwavelength surveys. Here, we show that the same model also successfully
explains the spectral shape and intensity of the X-ray background. The simplest
possible unified model assumes a constant ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN,
independent of redshift or luminosity. With almost no free parameters, the
predicted X-ray background agrees remarkably well with observations. Both the
observed properties of deep AGN samples and the X-ray background can be
explained by the same model without invoking different evolution for obscured
and unobscured AGN. Recent observational evidence shows that the ratio of
obscured to unobscured AGN may depend on luminosity. An AGN unification model
that allows for such a dependence also fits the X-ray background spectrum, and
the predicted numbers counts in the 2-10 keV X-ray band are in good agreement
with observations. We present predictions for the source counts in hard X-rays
(10-100 keV), which indicate that future missions like the Black Hole Finder
will observe thousands of heavily obscured AGN.",2005-05-13T20:08:58Z
"Disentangling the composite continuum of symbiotic binaries I. S-type
  systems","We describe a method of disentangling the composite,0.12-5 microns continuum
of symbiotic binaries.The observed SED is determined by the IUE/HST archival
spectra and flux-points corresponding to the optical UBVRI and infrared JHKLM
photometric measurements. The modeled SED is given by superposition of fluxes
from the cool giant, hot stellar source and nebula including the effect of the
Rayleigh scattering process and considering influence of the iron curtain
absorptions.We applied this method to 21 S-type symbiotic stars during
quiescence, activity and eclipses.",2005-07-12T07:18:47Z
Development of Kolmogorov spectrum in the pulsar radio emission,"It is shown that the scattering of electromagnetic waves by Langmuir ones
taking into the account the electric drift motion of particles, is the most
intense nonlinear process and should be responsible for the formation of
radiation spectrum of radio pulsars. Performed analysis indicates that in the
case of existence of inertial interval formation of stationary spectra is
possible. Analysis of linear mechanisms of wave generation and silk allows to
conclude that only possible stationary solution has spectral index $\alpha
=-1.5$. Obtained spectrum is in good agreement with observational data.",2005-05-12T14:07:16Z
Optimal Softening for N-Body Halo Simulations,"We propose to determine the optimal softening length in N-body halo
simulations by minimizing the ensemble-average acceleration error at a small
radius r0. This strategy ensures that the error never exceeds the optimal value
beyond r0. Furthermore, we derive semi-analytic formulae for calculating the
acceleration error due to the discreteness of particles and softened gravity,
which are validated by direct N-body force calculations. We estimate that
current state-of-the-art halo simulations suffer >~6% acceleration error at 1%
of the halo virial radius. The error grows rapidly toward the center and could
contribute significantly to the uncertainties of inner halo properties.",2005-07-10T20:13:13Z
"MACHe3, a prototype for non-baryonic dark matter search: KeV event
  detection and multicell correlation","Superfluid He3 at ultra-low temperatures (100 microKelvins) is a sensitive
medium for the bolometric detection of particles. MACHe3 (MAtrix of Cells of
Helium 3) is a project for non-baryonic dark matter search using He3 as a
sensitive medium. Simulations made on a high granularity detector show a very
good rejection to background signals. A multicell prototype including 3
bolometers has been developed to allow correlations between the cells for
background event discrimination. One of the cells contains a low activity Co57
source providing conversion electrons of 7.3 and 13.6 keV to confirm the
detection of low energy events. First results on the multicell prototype are
presented. A detection threshold of 1 keV has been achieved. The detection of
low energy conversion electrons coming from the Co57 source is highlighted as
well as the cosmic muon spectrum measurement. The possibility to reject
background events by using the correlation among the cells is demonstrated from
the simultaneous detection of muons in different cells.",2005-04-28T13:11:14Z
"Estimating the Porosity of the Interstellar Medium from
  Three-Dimensional Photoionization Modeling of H II Regions","We apply our three dimensional photoionization code to model Wisconsin
H-alpha Mapper observations of the H II region surrounding the O9.5V star Zeta
Oph. Our models investigate the porosity of the interstellar medium around zeta
Oph and the effects of 3D densities on the H-alpha surface brightness and
variation in the [N II]/H-alpha line ratio. The Zeta Oph H II region has a well
characterized ionizing source, so it is an excellent starting point for 3D
models of diffuse ionized gas. We investigate various hierarchically clumped
density structures, varying the overall smoothness within the clumping
algorithm. By simulating the observations, we can estimate the porosity of the
medium in the vicinity of Zeta Oph and find that within the context of our
hierarchically clumped models, around 50% to 80% of the volume is occupied by
clumps surrounded by a low density smooth medium. We also conclude that in
order for O stars to ionize the diffuse Warm Ionized Medium, the O star
environment must be more porous than that surrounding Zeta Oph, with clumps
occupying less than one half of the interstellar volume. Our clumpy models have
irregular boundaries, similar to observed H II regions. However, in observed H
II regions it is difficult to identify the precise location of the boundary
because of the foreground and/or background emission from the widespread Warm
Ionized Medium. This complicates the interpretation of the predicted rapid rise
of some emission line ratios near the edge of uniform density H II regions and
combined with the three dimensional clumpy nature of the interstellar medium
may explain the apparent lack of distinctive emission line ratios near H I -- H
II interfaces.",2005-06-15T12:01:23Z
"Discovery of a Magnetic White Dwarf/Probable Brown Dwarf Short-Period
  Binary","The magnetic white dwarf SDSS J121209.31+013627.7 exhibits a weak, narrow
Halpha emission line whose radial velocity and strength are modulated on a
period of ~90 minutes. Though indicative of irradiation on a nearby companion,
no cool continuum component is evident in the optical spectrum, and IR
photometry limits the absolute magnitude of the companion to M_J > 13.37. This
is equivalent to an isolated L5 dwarf, with T_eff < 1700 K. Consideration of
possible evolutionary histories suggests that, until ~0.6 Gyr ago, the brown
dwarf orbited a ~1.5 M_sun main seqeunce star with P ~ 1 yr, a ~ 1 AU, thus
resembling many of the gaseous superplanets being found in extrasolar planet
searches. Common envelope evolution when the massive star left the main
sequence reduced the period to only a few hours, and ensuing angular momentum
loss has further degraded the orbit. The binary is ripe for additional
observations aimed at better studying brown dwarfs and the effects of
irradiation on their structure.",2005-08-01T16:00:34Z
"Anti-de Sitter curvature radius constrained by quasars in brane-world
  scenarios","This paper is intended to investigate the luminosity due to accretion of gas
in supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the center of quasars, using a
brane-world scenario naturally endowed with extra dimensions, whereon theories
formulated introduce corrections in the field equations at high energies. SMBHs
possess the necessary highly energetic environment for the introduction of
these corrections, which are shown to produce small deviations in all SMBH
properties and, consequentely, corrections in the accretion theory that
supports quasars radiative processes. The radiative flux observed from quasars
indicates these deviations, from which the magnitude of the AdS$_5$ bulk
curvature radius, and consequently the extra dimension compactification radius
is estimated.",2005-05-06T18:10:28Z
MgII Absorption through Intermediate Redshift Galaxies,"The current status and remaining questions of MgII absorbers are reviewed
with an eye toward new results incorporating high quality Hubble Space
Telescope images of the absorbing galaxies. In the end, we find that our
current picture of extended gaseous regions around galaxies at earlier epochs
is in need of some revision; MgII absorbing ""halos"" appear to be patchier and
their geometry less regular than previously inferred. We also find that the
so-called ""weak"" MgII absorbers are associated with normal galaxies over a wide
range of impact parameters, suggesting that this class of absorber does not
strictly select low surface brightness, dwarf galaxies, or IGM material. We
emphasize the need for a complete survey of the galaxies in quasar fields, and
the importance of obtaining rotation curves of confirmed absorbing galaxies.",2005-04-18T15:35:21Z
"New distances of unresolved dwarf elliptical galaxies in the vicinity of
  the Local Group","We present Surface Brightness Fluctuation distances of nine early-type dwarf
galaxies and the S0 galaxy NGC 4150 in the Local Volume based on deep B- and
R-band CCD images obtained with the 2.56 metre Nordic Optical Telescope.
Typically, six stellar fields at various galactocentric distances have been
chosen for each galaxy as appropriately free of foreground stars and other
contaminants, and Fourier analysed to determine the distances, which are found
to lie in the range of 3 to 16 Mpc. The SBF method is thus demonstrated to
efficiently measure distances from the ground with mid-aperture telescopes for
galaxies for which only the tip of the red giant branch method in combination
with the Hubble Space Telescope has been available until now. We obtained the
following distance moduli: 28.11 +/- 0.15 mag (or 4.2 +/- 0.3 Mpc) for UGC
1703, 27.61 +/- 0.17 mag (or 3.3 +/- 0.3 Mpc) for KDG 61, 29.00 +/- 0.27 mag
(or 6.3 +/- 0.8 Mpc) for UGCA 200, 27.74 +/- 0.18 mag (or 3.5 +/- 0.3 Mpc) for
UGC 5442, 30.22 +/- 0.17 mag (or 11.1 +/- 0.9 Mpc) for UGC 5944, 30.79 +/- 0.11

"HST/Acs Weak-Lensing and Chandra X-Ray Studies of the High-Redshift
  Cluster MS 1054-0321","We present Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)
weak-lensing and Chandra X-ray analyses of MS 1054-0321 at z=0.83, the most
distant and X-ray luminous cluster in the Einstein Extended Medium-Sensitivity
Survey (EMSS). The high-resolution mass reconstruction through ACS weak-lensing
reveals the complicated dark matter substructure in unprecedented detail,
characterized by the three dominant mass clumps with the four or more minor
satellite groups within the current ACS field. The direct comparison of the
mass map with the Chandra X-ray image shows that the eastern weak-lensing
substructure is not present in the X-ray image and, more interestingly, the two
X-ray peaks are displaced away from the hypothesized merging direction with
respect to the corresponding central and western mass clumps, possibly because
of ram pressure. In addition, as observed in our previous weak-lensing study of
another high-redshift cluster CL 0152-1357 at z=0.84, the two dark matter
clumps of MS 1054-0321 seem to be offset from the galaxy counterparts. We
examine the significance of these offsets and discuss a possible scenario,
wherein the dark matter clumps might be moving ahead of the cluster galaxies.
The non-parametric weak-lensing mass modeling gives a projected mass of M(r<1
Mpc)=(1.02+-0.15)x 10^{15} solar mass, where the uncertainty reflects both the
statistical error and the cosmic shear effects. Our temperature measurement of
T=8.9_{-0.8}^{+1.0} keV utilizing the newest available low-energy quantum
efficiency degradation prescription for the Chandra instrument, together with
the isothermal beta description of the cluster (r_c=16""+-15"" and
beta=0.78+-0.08), yields a projected mass of M(r<1 Mpc)=(1.2+-0.2) x 10^{15}
solar mass, consistent with the weak-lensing result.",2005-08-01T16:08:49Z
The X-ray Spectral Properties of SCUBA Galaxies,"Deep SCUBA surveys have uncovered a large population of massive submm
galaxies (SMGs) at z>~1. Although it is generally believed that these galaxies
host intense star-formation activity, there is growing evidence that a
substantial fraction also harbor an AGN. We present here possibly the strongest
evidence for this viewpoint to date: the combination of ultra-deep X-ray
observations (the 2 Ms CDF-N) and deep Keck spectroscopic data. We find that
the majority (~75%) of the spectroscopically identified SMGs host AGN activity;
the other ~25% have X-ray properties consistent with star formation (X-ray
derived SFRs of ~1300-2700 solars/yr). The AGNs have properties generally
consistent with those of nearby luminous AGNs (L_X~1E43-3E44) and the majority
(~80%) are heavily obscured. We construct composite rest-frame 2-20 keV spectra
for three different obscuration classes. An ~1 keV equivalent width FeK-alpha
emission line is seen in the composite X-ray spectrum of the most heavily
obscured AGNs (N_H>5x10^{23}), suggesting Compton-thick or near Compton-thick
absorption. Even taking into account the effects of absorption, we find that
the average X-ray-FIR ratio of the AGN-classified SMGs is approximately one
order of magnitude below that found for typical quasars. This result suggests
that intense star-formation activity dominates the bolometric output; however,
we also explore whether the X-ray-FIR ratio is intrinsically less than that
found for typical quasars and postulate that some SMGs may be AGN dominated. We
investigate the growth of massive black holes, discuss prospects for deeper
observations, and explore the potential of the next generation of X-ray
observatories. (ABRIDGED).",2005-06-27T12:07:21Z
Exploiting VERITAS Timing Information,"The 499 pixel photomultiplier cameras of the VERITAS gamma ray telescopes are
instrumented with 500MHz sampling Flash ADCs. This paper describes a
preliminary investigation of the best methods by which to exploit this
information so as to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of
Cherenkov light pulses. The FADCs also provide unprecedented resolution for the
study of the timing characteristics of Cherenkov images of cosmic-ray and
gamma-ray air showers. This capability is discussed, together with the
implications for gamma-hadron separation.",2005-07-19T18:39:35Z
Metals in Star-Forming Galaxies at High Redshift,"The chemical composition of high-redshift galaxies is an important property
that gives clues to their past history and future evolution. Measuring
abundances in distant galaxies with current techniques is often a challenge,
and the canonical metallicity indicators can often not be applied. I discuss
currently available metallicity indicators based on stellar and interstellar
absorption and emission lines, and assess their limitations and systematic
uncertainties. Recent studies suggest that star-forming galaxies at redshift
around 3 have heavy-element abundances already close to solar, in agreement
with predictions from cosmological models.",2005-06-13T18:28:12Z
Faint Fuzzies and the Formation of Lenticular Galaxies,"We investigate the dynamical state of a new class of extended star clusters,
known as ""Faint Fuzzies"", that were discovered in two nearby S0 galaxies, NGC
1023 and NGC 3384. It is shown that the Faint Fuzzies of NGC 1023 lie in a fast
rotating ring-like structure within the galactic disk with mean radius of 5
kpc, rotational velocity of 200 km/s and velocity dispersion of 115 km/s. We
propose a scenario for the origin of Faint Fuzzies that is connected to the
origin of S0 galaxies as a result of galaxy-galaxy interactions in dense
environments. As is apparent in the Cartwheel galaxy, and is confirmed by
numerical simulations, the passage of a small galaxy through, or close to, the
center of a disk galaxy can form a ring of clumpy star formation with a radius
comparable to the Faint Fuzzy ring radius in NGC 1023. In this case, the Faint
Fuzzies are signposts for the transformation of spiral galaxies into
lenticulars via such interactions.",2005-04-04T12:52:37Z
"The dynamical fingerprint of intermediate mass black holes in globular
  clusters","A number of observations hints for the presence of an intermediate mass black
hole (IMBH) in the core of three globular clusters: M15 and NGC 6752 in the
Milky Way, and G1, in M31. However the existence of these IMBHs is far form
being conclusive. In this paper, we review their main formation channels and
explore possible observational signs that a single or binary IMBH can imprint
on cluster stars. In particular we explore the role played by a binary IMBH in
transferring angular momentum and energy to stars flying by.",2005-04-08T10:32:07Z
Crossing the Phantom Divide Barrier with Scalar Tensor Theories,"There is accumulating observational evidence (based on SnIa data) that the
dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ may be evolving with time and
crossing the phantom divide barrier $w=-1$ at recent times. The confirmation of
these indications by future data would indicate that minimally coupled
quintessence can not reproduce the observed expansion rate $H(z)$ for any
scalar field potential. Here we explicitly demonstrate that scalar tensor
theories of gravity (extended quintessence) can predict crossing of the phantom
divide barrier. We reconstruct phenomenologically viable scalar-tensor
potentials $F(\Phi)$ and $U(\Phi)$ that can reproduce a polynomial best fit
expansion rate $H(z)$ and the corresponding dark energy equation of state
parameter $w(z)$ crossing the $w=-1$ line. The form of the reconstructed scalar
tensor potentials is severely constrained but is not uniquely determined. This
is due to observational uncertainties in the form of $H(z)$ and also because a
single observed function $H(z)$ does not suffice for the reconstruction of the
two potential functions $F(\Phi)$ and $U(\Phi)$.",2005-04-26T20:08:31Z
The Accretion of Dark Energy onto a Black Hole,"The stationary, spherically symmetric accretion of dark energy onto a
Schwarzschild black hole is considered in terms of relativistic hydrodynamics.
The approximation of an ideal fluid is used to model the dark energy. General
expressions are derived for the accretion rate of an ideal fluid with an
arbitrary equation of state p=p(\rho) onto a black hole. The black hole mass
was found to decrease for the accretion of phantom energy. The accretion
process is studied in detail for two dark energy models that admit an
analytical solution: a model with a linear equation of state,
p=\alpha(\rho-\rho_0), and a Chaplygin gas. For one of the special cases of a
linear equation of state, an analytical expression is derived for the accretion
rate of dark energy onto a moving and rotating black hole. The masses of all
black holes are shown to approach zero in cosmological models with phantom
energy in which the Big Rip scenario is realized.",2005-05-31T11:25:13Z
"The K20 survey. VII. The spectroscopic catalogue: spectral properties
  and evolution of the galaxy population","The K20 survey is a near infrared-selected, deep (Ks < 20) redshift survey
targeting galaxies in two independent regions of the sky, the CDFS and the
q0055-2659 field. The total Ks-selected sample includes 545 objects. Optical
spectra for 525 of them have been obtained, providing 501 spectroscopic
identifications (including 12 type-1 AGN and 45 stars). This paper describes
the final K20 spectroscopic catalogue, along with the technique used to
determine redshifts, measure the spectral features and characterize the
spectra. The classification of the galaxy spectra has been performed according
to a simple parametric recipe that uses the equivalent widths of the two main
emission lines (O[II] and Halpha+[N II]) and two continuum indices (the 4000A
break index, and a near-UV color index, C(28-39)). We defined three main
spectroscopic classes: red early-type galaxies, blue emission-line galaxies and
the intermediate galaxies, which show emission lines but a red continuum. More
than 95% of the examined galaxies is included in one of these spectral types
and a composite spectrum is built for each of the three galaxy classes. The
blue emission-line and the early-type galaxies have been divided in redshift
bins, and the corresponding composite spectra have been built, in order to
investigate the evolution of the spectral properties of the K20 galaxies with
redshift.",2005-04-11T16:35:48Z
"Radial Distribution of Production Rates, Loss Rates and Densities

  Composition and Chemistry","In this paper we have studied the chemistry of C, H, N, O, and S compounds

1P/Halley. The production rates, loss rates, and ion mass densities are
calculated using the Analytical Yield Spectrum approach and solving coupled

Ultrahigh Energy Activity in Giant Magnetar Outbursts,"The recent superflare of 27 December 2004 from the magnetar SGR 1806-20 was

seeing exotic ultrahigh energy (UHE) radiation - neutrons, neutrinos, gamma
rays and charged cosmic rays - from it are far better from an energetic point
of view than from cosmological gamma ray bursts (GRBs). The chances for

"Chandra Observation of the Interaction between the Hot Plasma Nebula
  RCW89 and the Pulsar Jet of PSR B1509-58","We present a Chandra observation of the H II region RCW89. The nebula lies on
10' north from the central pulsar PSR B1509-58, and it has been suggested that
the nebula is irradiated by the pulsar jet. We performed a spectral analysis of
the seven brightest emitting regions aligned in a ``horse-shoe'' shape, and
found that the temperature of the knots increases along the ``horse-shoe'' in
the clockwise direction, while, in contrast, the ionization parameter
decreases. This strongly supports a picture of energy transfer via the
precessing pulsar jet. We examined the energy budget assuming that RCW89 is
powered by the pulsar jet, and confirmed that the pulsar rotational energy loss
is sufficient to drive the nebula. The rate of energy injection into RCW89 by
the jet was estimated from the synchrotron radiation flux. We obtained a
heating time-scale of 1400 yr, which is consistent with the pulsar
characteristic age of 1700 yr. To explain the temperature gradient, we discuss
the cooling process for plasma clouds in RCW89. We argue that the plasma clouds
can be cooled down by the adiabatic expansion within 70 yr, and form the
temperature gradient reflecting the sequential heating by the precessing pulsar
jet. We also determined the velocities of the individual plasma clouds by
spectral fitting. The plasma clouds in RCW89 are moving away at 240 ~ 860 km/s,
which constrains the inclination angle of the pulsar spin axis i > 50 degree
and the expanding velocity of the shell as v > 1100 km/s.",2005-07-02T08:59:33Z
"Gravoturbulent Star Formation: Effects of the Equation of State on
  Stellar Masses","Stars form by gravoturbulent fragmentation of interstellar gas clouds. The
supersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in Galactic molecular gas generates
strong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most
massive regions. Collapse sets in to build up stars and star clusters.
  Turbulence plays a dual role. On global scales it provides support, while at
the same time it can promote local collapse. Stellar birth is thus intimately
linked to the dynamic behavior of parental gas clouds, which governs when and
where protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass via
accretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. The equation
of state plays a pivotal role in the fragmentation process. Under typical cloud
conditions, massive stars form as part of dense clusters following the ""normal""
mass function observed, e.g. in the solar neighborhood. However, for gas with
an effective polytropic index greater than unity star formation becomes biased
towards isolated massive stars. This is relevant for understanding the
properties of zero-metallicity stars (Population III) or stars that form under
extreme environmental conditions like in the Galactic center or in luminous
starbursts.",2005-06-15T16:43:05Z
"Constraining the extra heating of the Diffuse Ionized Gas in the Milky
  Way","The detailed observations of the diffuse ionized gas through the emission
lines H$\alpha$, [NII], and [SII] in the Perseus Arm of our Galaxy by the
Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper (WHAM)--survey challenge photoionization models.
They have to explain the observed rise in the line ratios [NII]/H$\alpha$ and
[SII]/H$\alpha$. The models described here consider for the first time the
detailed observational geometry toward the Perseus Arm. The models address the
vertical variation of the line ratios up to height of 2 kpc above the midplane.
The rising trends of the line ratios are matched. The increase in the line
ratios is reflected in a rise of the temperature of the gas layer. This is due
to the progressive hardening of the radiation going through the gas. However an
extra heating above photoionization is needed to explain the absolute values.
Two different extra heating rates are investigated which are proportional to
$n^0$ and $n^1$. The models show that a combination of both are best to explain
the data, where the extra heating independent of density is dominant for z $>$
0.8 kpc.",2005-06-24T15:40:19Z
Probing the Shape of the Galactic Halo with Hyper-Velocity Stars,"Precise proper motion measurements (sigma_mu ~ 10 mkas/yr) of the recently
discovered hyper-velocity star (HVS) SDSS J090745.0+024507 would yield
significant constraints on the axis ratios and orientation of a triaxial model
for the Galactic halo. Triaxiality of dark matter halos is predicted by Cold
Dark Matter models of galaxy formation and may be used to probe the nature of
dark matter. However, unless the distance to this star is determined to better
than 10%, these constraints suffer from one-dimensional degeneracies, which we
quantify. We show how proper motion measurements of several HVSs could
simultaneously resolve the distance degeneracies of all such stars and produce
a detailed picture of the triaxial halo. Additional HVSs may be found from
radial velocity surveys or from parallax/proper-motion data derived from GAIA.
High-precision proper-motion measurements of these stars using the Space
Interferometry Mission (SIM PlanetQuest) would substantially tighten the
constraints they yield on the Galactic potential.",2005-06-30T16:24:49Z
"Zeeman tomography of magnetic white dwarfs II. The quadrupole-dominated
  magnetic field of HE 1045-0908","We report time-resolved optical flux and circular polarization spectroscopy
of the magnetic DA white dwarf HE 1045-0908 obtained with FORS1 at the ESO VLT.
Considering published results, we estimate a likely rotational period of Prot ~
2.7 h, but cannot exclude values as high as about 9 h. Our detailed Zeeman
tomographic analysis reveals a field structure which is dominated by a
quadrupole and contains additional dipole and octupole contributions, and which
does not depend strongly on the assumed value of the period. A good fit to the
Zeeman flux and polarization spectra is obtained if all field components are
centred and inclinations of their magnetic axes with respect to each other are
allowed for. The fit can be slightly improved if an offset from the centre of
the star is included. The prevailing surface field strength is 16 MG, but
values between 10 and ~75MG do occur. We derive an effective photospheric
temperature of HE 1045-0908 of Teff = 10000 +/- 1000 K. The tomographic code
makes use of an extensive database of pre-computed Zeeman spectra (Paper I).",2005-07-27T10:54:44Z
"The Origin of Massive O-type Field Stars. Part II: Field O stars as
  runaways","In two papers we try to confirm that all Galactic high-mass stars are formed
in a cluster environment, by excluding that O-type stars found in the Galactic
field actually formed there. In de Wit et al. (2004) we presented deep K-band
imaging of 5 arcmin fields centred on 43 massive O-type field stars that
revealed that the large majority of these objects are single objects. In this
contribution we explore the possibility that the field O stars are dynamically
ejected from young clusters, by investigating their peculiar space velocity
distribution, their distance from the Galactic plane, and their spatial
vicinity to known young stellar clusters. We (re-)identify 22 field O-type
stars as candidate runaway OB-stars. The statistics show that ~4% of all O-type
stars with V < 8 can be considered as formed outside a cluster environment.
Most are spectroscopically single objects, some are visual binaries. The
derived percentage for O-type stars that form isolated in the field based on
our statistical analyses is in agreement with what is expected from
calculations adopting a universal cluster richness distribution with power
index of beta = 1.7, assuming that the cluster richness distribution is
continuous down to the smallest clusters containing one single star.",2005-03-16T09:01:19Z
"Detection of gravity waves by phase modulation of the light from a
  distant star","We propose a novel method for detecting gravitational waves (GW), where a
light signal emitted from a distant star interacts with a local (also distant)
GW source and travels towards the Earth, where it is detected. While traveling
in the field of the GW, the light acquires specific phase modulation (which we
account in the eikonal approximation). This phase modulation can be considered
as a coherent spreading of the given initial photons energy over a set of
satellite lines, spaced at the frequency of GW (from quantum point of view it
is multi-graviton absorption and emission processes). This coherent state of
photons with the energy distributed among the set of equidistant lines, can be
analyzed and identified on Earth either by passing the signal through a
Fabry-Perot filter or by monitoring the intensity-intensity correlations at
different times.",2005-06-24T16:03:47Z
"Constraining population synthesis models via the binary neutron star
  population","The observed sample of double neutron-star (NS-NS) binaries presents a
challenge to population-synthesis models of compact object formation: the
parameters entering into these models must be carefully chosen so as to match
(i) the observed star formation rate and (ii) the formation rate of NS-NS
binaries, which can be estimated from the observed sample and the selection
effects related to the discoveries with radio-pulsar surveys. In this paper, we
select from an extremely broad family of possible population synthesis models
those few (2%) which are consistent with the observed sample of NS-NS binaries.
To further sharpen the constraints the observed NS-NS population places upon
our understanding of compact-object formation processes, we separate the
observed NS-NS population into two channels: (i) merging NS-NS binaries, which
will inspiral and merge through the action of gravitational waves within $10 $
Gyr, and (ii) wide NS-NS binaries, consisting of all the rest. With the subset
of astrophysically consistent models, we explore the implications for the rates
at which double black hole (BH-BH), black hole-neutron star (BH-NS), and NS-NS
binaries will merge through the emission of gravitational waves.",2005-04-21T17:29:34Z

"Deriving stellar properties from photometry: maximizing information
  content and minimizing biases","I study the importance of the accurate calibration of photometric systems in
order to produce meaningful comparisons between the observed colors +
magnitudes and model SEDs. Possible sources of errors are discussed and two
examples are analyzed. I show that well-calibrated Tycho-2 photometry is stable
and precise enough for such comparisons. On the contrary, the available
calibrations for Johnson UBV photometry yield relative large systematic errors,
which has prompted me to develop a new, more precise calibration. The
advantages of multicolor photometry over the standard single-color + magnitude
diagrams for the derivation of physical properties of stars (elimination of
degeneracies, inclusion of multiple parameters, avoidance of linearizing
approximations, possibility of a more precise treatment of errors) are
discussed through the use of CHORIZOS, a code developed specifically for this
purpose.",2005-06-13T17:39:18Z
"Upper Limits on the Extragalactic Background Light from the Gamma-Ray
  Spectra of Blazars","The direct measurement of the extragalactic background light (EBL) is
difficult at optical to infrared wavelengths because of the strong foreground
radiation originating in the Solar System. Very high energy (VHE, E$>$100 GeV)
gamma rays interact with EBL photons of these wavelengths through pair
production. In this work, the available VHE spectra from six blazars are used
to place upper limits on the EBL. These blazars have been detected over a range
of redshifts and a steepening of the spectral index is observed with increasing
source distance. This can be interpreted as absorption by the EBL. In general,
knowledge of the intrinsic source spectrum is necessary to determine the
density of the intervening EBL. Motivated by the observed spectral steepening
with redshift, upper limits on the EBL are derived by assuming that the
intrinsic spectra of the six blazars are $\propto E^{-1.8}$. Upper limits are
then placed on the EBL flux at discrete energies without assuming a specific
spectral shape for the EBL. This is an advantage over other methods since the
EBL spectrum is uncertain.",2005-04-18T19:37:34Z
Number ratios of young stellar objects in embedded clusters,"Embedded clusters usually contain young stellar objects in different
evolutionary stages. We investigate number ratios of objects in these classes
in the star-forming regions rho Ophiuchi, Serpens, Taurus, Chamaeleon I, NGC
7129, IC 1396A, and IC 348. They are compared to the temporal evolution of
young stars in numerical simulations of gravoturbulent fragmentation in order
to constrain the models and to possibly determine the evolutionary stage of the
clusters. It turns out that Serpens is the youngest, and IC 348 the most
evolved cluster, although the time when the observations are best represented
varies strongly depending on the model. Furthermore, we find an inverse
correlation of the star formation efficiency (SFE) of the models with the Mach
number. However, the observational SFE values cannot be reproduced by the
current isothermal models. This argues for models that take into account
protostellar feedback processes and/or the effects of magnetic fields.",2005-03-29T09:08:32Z
Preheating by Previrialization and its Impact on Galaxy Formation,"We use recent observations of the HI-mass function to constrain galaxy
formation. The data conflicts with the standard model where most of the gas in
a low-mass dark matter halo is assumed to settle into a disk of cold gas that
is depleted by star formation and supernova-driven outflows until the disk
becomes gravitationally stable. A consistent model can be found if low-mass
haloes are embedded in a preheated medium, with a specific gas entropy ~ 10Kev
cm^2. Such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxy
luminosity function. We propose a preheating model where the medium around
low-mass haloes is preheated by gravitational pancaking. Since gravitational
tidal fields suppress the formation of low-mass haloes while promoting that of
pancakes, the formation of massive pancakes precedes that of the low-mass
haloes within them. We demonstrate that the progenitors of present-day dark
matter haloes with M<10^{12}h^{-1}\msun were embedded in pancakes of masses
$~5x10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$ at z~2. The formation of such pancakes heats the gas to
a temperature of 5x10^5K and compresses it to an overdensity of ~10. Such gas
has a cooling time that exceeds the age of the Universe at z~2, and has a
specific entropy of ~15Kev cm^2, almost exactly the amount required to explain
the stellar and HI mass functions. (Abridged)",2005-06-21T22:50:09Z
High-precision K-band photometry of the secondary eclipse of HD209458,"Recently, mid-infrared Spitzer observations have been presented that show the
light decrement due to the passage of a planet behind its host star. These
measurements of HD209458b and TrES-1 are the first detections of direct light
from an extra-solar planet. Interpretation of these results in terms of planet
equipartition temperature and bond albedo is however strongly model dependent
and require additional observations at shorter wavelengths. Here we report on
two attempts to detect the secondary eclipse of HD209458b from the ground in
K-band, using the UK InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT). A photometry precision of
0.12% relative to two nearby reference stars was reached during both occasions,
but no firm detection of the eclipses were obtained. The first observation
shows a flux decrement of -0.13+-0.18%, and the second of -0.10+-0.10%. A
detailed description of the observing strategy, data reduction and analysis is
given, and a discussion on how the precision in ground-based K-band photometry
could be further improved. In addition we show that the relative photometry
between the target and the reference stars between the two epochs is consistent
down to the <0.1% level, which is interesting in the light of possible
near-infrared surveys to search for transiting planets around M and L dwarfs.",2005-07-26T19:32:11Z
X-ray Emission from the Weak-lined T Tauri Binary System KH 15D,"The unique eclipsing, weak-lined T Tauri star KH 15D has been detected as an
X-ray source in a 95.7 ks exposure from the Chandra X-ray Observatory archives.
A maximum X-ray luminosity of 1.5 x 10^{29} erg s$^{-1}$ is derived in the
0.5--8 keV band, corresponding to L_{X}/L_bol = 7.5 x 10^{-5}. Comparison with
samples of stars of similar effective temperature in NGC 2264 and in the Orion
Nebula Cluster shows that this is about an order of magnitude low for a typical
star of its mass and age. We argue that the relatively low luminosity cannot be
attributed to absorption along the line of sight but implies a real deficiency
in X-ray production. Possible causes for this are considered in the context of
a recently proposed eccentric binary model for KH 15D. In particular, we note
that the visible component rotates rather slowly for a weak-lined T Tauri star
and has possibly been pseudosynchronized by tidal interaction with the primary
near periastron.",2005-06-08T12:53:11Z
Line profiles of molecular ions toward the pre-stellar core LDN 1544,"Velocity profiles of ground state lines of H2D+, HC18O+ and N2H+, observed
previously with the CSO and IRAM 30m telescopes, are modeled with a Monte Carlo
radiative transfer program to study the temperature, density and velocity
structure of the pre-stellar core LDN 1544. The H2D+ line is double-peaked like
that of the other ions, but previous models that fit the HC18O+ and N2H+
profiles are found not to fit the H2D+ data. Matching the H2D+ observations
requires at least three modifications to the model at small radii: (1) the
density profile must continue to rise inward and not flatten off toward the
center; (2) the gas temperature must be nearly constant and not drop inwards
significantly; (3) the infall velocity must increase inward, in a fashion
intermediate between `quasi-static' (ambipolar diffusion) and `fully dynamic'
(Larson-Penston) collapse. The C18O emission indicates a chemical age of <~0.1
Myr. The effects of a flattened structure and rotation on the line profiles are
shown to be unimportant, at least on the scales probed by single-dish
telescopes. Alternatively, the H2D+ profile is affected by absorption in the
outer layers of the core, if gas motions in these layers are sufficiently
small.",2005-05-04T13:45:58Z
Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors,"Based on a new sample of 355 quasars with significant optical polarization
and using complementary statistical methods, we confirm that quasar
polarization vectors are not randomly oriented over the sky with a probability
often in excess of 99.9%. The polarization vectors appear coherently oriented
or aligned over huge (~ 1 Gpc) regions of the sky located at both low (z ~ 0.5)
and high (z ~ 1.5) redshifts and characterized by different preferred
directions of the quasar polarization. In fact, there seems to exist a regular
alternance along the line of sight of regions of randomly and aligned
polarization vectors with a typical comoving length scale of 1.5 Gpc.
Furthermore, the mean polarization angle \bar{\theta} appears to rotate with
redshift at the rate of ~ 30\degr per Gpc. The symmetry of the the \bar{\theta}
-z relation is mirror-like, the mean polarization angle rotating clockwise with
increasing redshift in North Galactic hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the
South Galactic one. These characteristics make the alignment effect difficult
to explain in terms of local mechanisms, namely a contamination by interstellar
polarization in our Galaxy. While interpretations like a global rotation of the
Universe can potentially explain the effect, the properties we observe
qualitatively correspond to the dichroism and birefringence predicted by
photon-pseudoscalar oscillation within a magnetic field. Interestingly, the
alignment effect seems to be prominent along an axis not far from preferred
directions tentatively identified in the CMB maps. Although many questions and
more particularly the interpretation of the effect remain open, alignments of
quasar polarization vectors appear as a promising new way to probe the Universe
and its dark components at extremely large scales.",2005-07-12T08:32:15Z
Can the initial singularity be detected by cosmological tests?,"In the present paper we raise the question whether initial cosmological
singularity can be proved from the cosmological tests. The classical general
relativity predict the existence of singularity in the past if only some energy
conditions are satisfied. On the other hand the latest quantum gravity
applications to cosmology suggest of possibility of avoiding the singularity
and replace it with the bounce. The distant type Ia supernovae data are used to
constraints on bouncing evolutional scenario where square of the Hubble
function $H^2$ is given by formulae
$H^2=H^2_0[\Omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{m}-\Omega_{n,0}(1+z)^{n}]$, where $\Omega_{m,0},
\Omega_{n,0}>0$ are density parameters and $n>m>0$. We show that the on the
base of the SNIa data standard bouncing models can be ruled out on the
$4\sigma$ confidence level. If we add the cosmological constant to the standard
bouncing model then we obtain as the best-fit that the parameter $\Omega_{n,0}$
is equal zero which means that the SNIa data do not support the bouncing term
in the model. The bounce term is statistically insignificant the present epoch.
We also demonstrate that BBN offer the possibility of obtaining stringent
constraints of the extra term $\Omega_{n,0}$. The other observational test
methods like CMB and the age of oldest objects in the Universe are used. We
also use the Akaike informative criterion to select a model according to the
goodness of fit and we conclude that this term should be ruled out by Occam's
razor, which makes that the big bang is favored rather then bouncing scenario.",2005-04-21T11:20:07Z
"ISO observations of the Wolf-Rayet galaxies NGC 5430, NGC 6764, Mrk 309
  and VII Zw 19","Observations of four WR galaxies (NGC 5430, NGC 6764, Mrk 309 and VII Zw 19)
using the Infrared Space Observatory are presented here. ISOCAM maps of NGC
5430, Mrk 309 and NGC 6764 revealed the location of star formation regions in
each of these galaxies. ISOPHOT spectral observations from 4 to 12 microns
detected the ubiquitous PAH bands in the nuclei of the targets and several of
the disk star forming regions, while LWS spectroscopy detected [OI] and [CII]
emission lines from two galaxies, NGC 5430 and NGC 6764.
  Using a combination of ISO and IRAS flux densities, a dust model based on the
sum of modified blackbody components was successfully fitted to the available
data. These models were then used to calculate new values for the total IR
luminosities for each galaxy, the size of the various dust populations, and the
global SFR.
  The derived flux ratios, the SFRs, the high L(PAH)/L(40-120 microns) and
F(PAH 7.7 microns)/F(7.7 microns continuum) values suggest that most of these
galaxies are home to only a compact burst of star formation. The exception is
NGC 6764, whose F(PAH 7.7 microns)/F(7.7 microns continuum) value of 1.22 is
consistent with the presence of an AGN, yet the L(PAH)/L(40-120 microns) is
more in line with a starburst, a finding in line with a compact low-luminosity
AGN dominated by the starburst.",2005-06-01T21:57:39Z
Bivariate Galaxy Luminosity Functions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"Bivariate luminosity functions (LFs) are computed for galaxies in the New
York Value-Added Galaxy Catalogue, based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release 4. The galaxy properties investigated are the morphological type,
inverse concentration index, Sersic index, absolute effective surface
brightness, reference frame colours, absolute radius, eClass spectral type,
stellar mass and galaxy environment. The morphological sample is flux-limited
to galaxies with r < 15.9 and consists of 37,047 classifications to an RMS
accuracy of +/- half a class in the sequence E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd, Im. These
were assigned by an artificial neural network, based on a training set of 645
eyeball classifications. The other samples use r < 17.77 with a median redshift
of z ~ 0.08, and a limiting redshift of z < 0.15 to minimize the effects of
evolution. Other cuts, for example in axis ratio, are made to minimize biases.
A wealth of detail is seen, with clear variations between the LFs according to
absolute magnitude and the second parameter. They are consistent with an early
type, bright, concentrated, red population and a late type, faint, less
concentrated, blue, star forming population. This bimodality suggests two major
underlying physical processes, which in agreement with previous authors we
hypothesize to be merger and accretion, associated with the properties of
bulges and discs respectively. The bivariate luminosity-surface brightness
distribution is fit with the Choloniewski function (a Schechter function in
absolute magnitude and Gaussian in surface brightness). The fit is found to be
poor, as might be expected if there are two underlying processes.",2005-07-22T19:58:39Z
Hot-Jupiters and hot-Neptunes: a common origin?,"We compare evolutionary models for close-in exoplanets coupling irradiation
and evaporation due respectively to the thermal and high energy flux of the
parent star with observations of recently discovered new transiting planets.
The models provide an overall good agreement with observations, although at the
very limit of the quoted error bars of OGLE-TR-10, depending on its age. Using
the same general theory, we show that the three recently detected hot-Neptune
planets (GJ436, $\rho$ Cancri, $\mu$ Ara) may originate from more massive gas
giants which have undergone significant evaporation. We thus suggest that
hot-Neptunes and hot-Jupiters may share the same origin and evolution history.
Our scenario provides testable predictions in terms of the mass-radius
relationships of these hot-Neptunes.",2005-05-03T12:41:07Z

Systematic Analysis of 22 Microlensing Parallax Candidates,"We attempt to identify all microlensing parallax events for which the
parallax fit improves \Delta\chi^2 > 100 relative to a standard microlensing
model. We outline a procedure to identify three types of discrete degeneracies
(including a new one that we dub the ``ecliptic degeneracy'') and find many new
degenerate solutions in 16 previously published and 6 unpublished events. Only
four events have one unique solution and the other 18 events have a total of 44
solutions. Our sample includes three previously identified black-hole (BH)
candidates. We consider the newly discovered degenerate solutions and determine
the relative likelihood that each of these is a BH. We find the lens of event
MACHO-99-BLG-22 is a strong BH candidate (78%), event MACHO-96-BLG-5 is a
marginal BH candidate (37%), and MACHO-98-BLG-6 is a weak BH candidate (2.2%).
The lens of event OGLE-2003-BLG-84 may be a Jupiter-mass free-floating planet
candidate based on a weak 3 sigma detection of finite-source effects. We find
that event MACHO-179-A is a brown dwarf candidate within ~100 pc of the Sun,
mostly due to its very small projected Einstein radius, \tilde r_E = 0.23+-0.05
AU. As expected, these microlensing parallax events are biased toward lenses
that are heavier and closer than average. These events were examined for
xallarap (or binary-source motion), which can mimic parallax. We find that 23%
of these events are strongly affected by xallarap.",2005-06-09T19:16:03Z
Fitting Photometry of Blended Microlensing Events,"We reexamine the usefulness of fitting blended lightcurve models to
microlensing photometric data. We find agreement with previous workers (e.g.
Wozniak & Paczynski) that this is a difficult proposition because of the
degeneracy of blend fraction with other fit parameters. We show that follow-up
observations at specific point along the lightcurve (peak region and wings) of
high magnification events are the most helpful in removing degeneracies. We
also show that very small errors in the baseline magnitude can result in
problems in measuring the blend fraction, and study the importance of
non-Gaussian errors in the fit results. The biases and skewness in the
distribution of the recovered blend fraction is discussed. We also find a new
approximation formula relating the blend fraction and the unblended fit
parameters to the underlying event duration needed to estimate microlensing
optical depth.",2005-07-08T19:10:22Z
GRB-supernovae: a new spin on gravitational waves,"The discovery of the GRB-supernova association poses the question on the
nature of the inner engine as the outcome of Type Ib/c supernovae. These events
are believed to represent core-collapse of massive stars, probably in
low-period stellar binaries and similar but not identical to the Type II event
SN1987A. The branching ratio of Type Ib/c supernovae into GRB-supernovae has
the remarkably small value of less than 0.5%. These observational constraints
point towards a rapidly rotating black hole formed at low probability with low
kick velocity. The putative black hole hereby remains centered, and matures
into a high-mass object with large rotational energy in angular momentum. As
the MeV-neutrino emissions from SN1987A demonstrate, the most powerful probe of
the inner workings of core-collapse events are radiation channels to which the
remnant envelope is optically thin. We here discuss the prospect of
gravitational-wave emissions powered by a rapidly rotating central black hole
which, in contrast to MeV-neutrinos, can be probed to distances as large as
100Mpc through upcoming gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. We
identify the GRB-emissions, commonly attributed to ultrarelativistic
baryon-poor ejecta, with a new process of linear acceleration of charged
particles along the axis of rotation of a black hole in response to spin-orbit
coupling. We include some preliminary numerical simulations on internal shocks
produced by intermittent ejecta. The results showing a radial splash, which
points towards low-luminosity and lower-energy radiation at large angles,
possibly related to X-ray flashes.",2005-06-09T00:29:10Z
"Disentangling the wind and the disk in the close surrounding of the
  young stellar object MWC297 with AMBER/VLTI","The young stellar object MWC297 is a B1.5Ve star exhibiting strong hydrogen
emission lines. This object has been observed by the AMBER/VLTI instrument in
2-telescope mode in a sub-region of the K spectral band centered around the Br
gamma line at 2.1656 microns. The object has not only been resolved in the
continuum with a visibility of 0.50+/-0.10, but also in the Br gamma line,
where the flux is about twice larger, with a visibility about twice smaller
(0.33+/-0.06). The continuum emission is consistent with the expectation of an
optically thick thermal emission from dust in a circumstellar disk. The
hydrogen emission can be understood by the emission of a halo above the disk
surface. It can be modelled as a latitudinal-dependant wind model and it
explains the width, the strength and the visibibility through the emission
lines. The AMBER data associated with a high resolution ISAAC spectrum
constrains the apparent size of the wind but also its kinematics.",2005-07-09T08:56:58Z
"The theory of canonical perturbations applied to attitude dynamics and
  to the Earth rotation. Osculating and nonosculating Andoyer variables","The Hamiltonian theory of Earth rotation, known as the Kinoshita-Souchay
theory, operates with nonosculating Andoyer elements. This situation parallels
a similar phenomenon that often happens (but seldom gets noticed) in orbital
dynamics, when the standard Lagrange-type or Delaunay-type planetary equations
unexpectedly render nonosculating orbital elements. In orbital mechanics,
osculation loss happens when a velocity-dependent perturbation is plugged into
the standard planetary equations. In attitude mechanics, osculation is lost
when an angular-velocity-dependent disturbance is plugged in the standard
dynamical equations for the Andoyer elements. We encounter exactly this
situation in the theory of Earth rotation, because this theory contains an
angular-velocity-dependent perturbation (the switch from an inertial frame to
that associated with the precessing ecliptic of date).
  While the osculation loss does not influence the predictions for the figure
axis of the planet, it considerably alters the predictions for the
instantaneous spin-axis' orientation. We explore this issue in great detail.",2005-06-19T20:50:26Z
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of (Non-magnetic) Cataclysmic Variables,"HST and FUSE have provided high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra of a
variety of cataclysmic variables and have allowed a detailed characterization
of FUV emission sources in both high and low states. Here, I describe how this
has advanced our understanding of non-magnetic CVs and the substantial
interpretive challenges still posed by the observations. In the high state, the
FUV spectra are dominated by disk emission that is modified by scattering in
high and low velocity material located above the disk photosphere. Progress is
being made toward reproducing the high-state spectra using kinematic
prescriptions of the velocity field and new ionization and radiative transfer
codes. In conjunction with hydrodynamical simulations of the outflows, accurate
estimates of the mass loss rates and determination of the launching mechanism
are likely forthcoming. In quiescence, the FUV spectra reveal contributions
from the WD and the disk. Quantitative analyses have lead to solid measurements
of the temperatures and abundances of a number of WDs in CVs, and of a
determination of the response of the WD to an outburst. Basic challenges exist
in terms of understanding the other components of the emission in quiescence,
however, and these are needed to better understand the structure of the disk
and the physical mechanisms resulting in ongoing accretion in quiescence.",2005-06-21T17:23:13Z
Z-bursts from the Virgo cluster,"Resonant annihilation of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos (UHECnu) on the
cosmic neutrino background (CnuB) into Z bosons--the Z-burst mechanism--and its
associated absorption and emission phenomenology provide a unique, albeit
indirect, probe of the CnuB in its present state. In this paper, we examine the
implications of gravitational clustering of the CnuB in nearby galaxy clusters
for the Z-burst phenomenology. In particular, we study the emission features of
the Z-decay products originating from the Virgo cluster, and the potential of
future cosmic ray experiments to observe clustering-enhanced Z-burst rates. We
find that a detector with an exposure equivalent to three years of observations
at the Extreme Universe Space Observatory (EUSO) will very likely measure these
enhanced rates together with the associated UHECnu flux, provided that the
latter saturates current observational limits and the neutrino masses are
quasi-degenerate, m_nu_i < 0.1 eV. In the case of UHECnu fluxes below the
electromagnetic cascade limit, or a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum, an
experimental sensitivity exceeding that of EUSO by at least two orders of
magnitude is required to detect the clustering enhancements with any certainty.",2005-05-27T17:27:17Z
"Early Re-brightenings in GRB Afterglows as Signatures of Low-to-High
  Density Boundary","The association of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with star forming regions and
the idea of massive stars as progenitors of GRBs are widely accepted. Because
of their short lifetimes, it is very likely that massive stars are still
embedded in dense molecular clouds when they give birth to GRBs. Stellar winds
from GRB progenitors can create low-density bubbles with sizes and densities
strongly depending on the initial ambient density. A boundary between the
bubble and the dense molecular cloud must exist with the density at the
boundary increasing from that of the bubble to that of the outer cloud. We have
calculated the lightcurves of the afterglows in such environments with three
regions: the stellar wind region, the boundary, and the molecular cloud. We
show that the interaction between the cylindrical jet and the density boundary
can result in a re-brightening of the afterglow occurring as early as ~1 day
after the GRB. We compare our models with the optical afterglows of GRB970508,
GRB000301C, and GRB030226. We find that the values of our model parameters,
including the radius of the wind bubble, the densities in the bubble and in the
outer molecular cloud are within typical ranges.",2005-04-01T17:31:13Z
"The effect of grain size distribution on H$_2$ formation rate in the
  interstellar medium","The formation of molecular hydrogen in the interstellar medium takes place on
the surfaces of dust grains. Hydrogen molecules play a role in gas-phase
reactions that produce other molecules, some of which serve as coolants during
gravitational collapse and star formation. Thus, the evaluation of the
roduction rate of hydrogen molecules and its dependence on the physical
conditions in the cloud are of great importance. Interstellar dust grains
exhibit a broad size distribution in which the small grains capture most of the
surface area. Recent studies have shown that the production efficiency strongly
depends on the grain composition and temperature as well as on its size. In
this paper we present a formula which provides the total production rate of
H$_2$ per unit volume in the cloud, taking into account the grain composition
and temperature as well as the grain size distribution. The formula agrees very
well with the master equation results. It shows that for a physically relevant
range of grain temperatures, the production rate of H$_2$ is significantly
enhanced due to their broad size distribution.",2005-08-01T08:47:47Z
"Spectroscopic Study of SU UMa-type Dwarf Nova YZ Cnc during its 2002
  Superoutburst","We report time-resolved spectroscopic observations of the SU Ursae Majoris
dwarf nova, YZ Cnc, for 2 nights over 11 hrs during its 2002 January
superoutburst. The spectra only show absorption-line profiles in the first day.
But the lines display blue and red troughs, with ``W'' profiles in the second
day. The radial velocity curve of the absorption troughs and emission peaks of
H$\beta$ has an amplitude of $49\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$ and a phase offset of
$-0.07\pm0.04$, which are very similar to those measured in quiescence;
however, the $\gamma$ velocity deviates strongly from the systemic velocity
measured in quiescence, showing variation of the order of $\pm$60 km s$^{-1}$.
And large shifts of $\sim$70 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$0.09, for the
orbital-averaged velocity and phase respectively, are also found in our
observations. All these phenomena can be well explained with a precession of an
eccentric disk and we conclude that these phenomena are the characteristic
products of an eccentric accretion disk.",2005-07-11T09:11:59Z
The [O III] Veil: Astropause of Eta Carinae's Wind?,"We present narrowband images of eta Carinae in the light of [O III] 5007
obtained with HST/WFPC2, as well as a ground-based image in the same emission
line with a larger field of view. These images show a thin veil of [O III]
emission around eta Car and its ejecta, confirming the existence of an
oxygen-bearing ``cocoon'' inferred from spectra. This [O III] veil may be the
remnant of the pre-outburst wind of eta Car, and its outer edge probably marks
the interface where eta Car's ejecta meet the stellar wind of the nearby O4
V((f)) star HD303308 or other ambient material -- i.e., it marks the
``astropause'' in eta Car's wind. This veil is part of a more extensive [O III]
shell that appears to be shaped and ionized by HD303308. A pair of HST images
with a 10 yr baseline shows no proper motion, limiting the expansion speed away
from eta Car to 12pm13 km/s, or an expansion age of a few times 10^4 yr. Thus,
this is probably the decelerated pre-outburst LBV wind of eta Car. The [O III]
morphology is very different from that seen in [N II], which traces young knots
of CNO-processed material; this represents a dramatic shift in the chemical
makeup of material recently ejected by eta Car. This change in the chemical
abundances may have resulted from the sudden removal of the star's outer
envelope during eta Car's 19th century outburst or an earlier but similar
event.",2005-07-07T23:10:32Z
Prompt Mergers of Neutron Stars with Black Holes,"Mergers of neutron stars with black holes have been suggested as candidates
for short gamma-ray bursts. They have also been studied for their potential as
gravitational wave sources observable with ground-based detectors. For these
purposes, it is important to know under what circumstances such a merger could
leave an accretion disk or result in a period of stable mass transfer. We show
that, consistent with recent numerical simulations, it is expected that mergers
between neutron stars and black holes will be prompt, with no accretion disk
and no stable mass transfer, if the black hole has a mass greater than that of
the neutron star and is spinning slowly. The reason is that for comparable
masses, angular momentum loss to gravitational radiation starts a plunge orbit
well outside the innermost stable circular orbit, causing direct merging rather
than extended mass transfer. Even when the black hole is spinning rapidly and
exactly prograde with respect to the orbit, we show that it is possible within
current understanding that no accretion disk will form under any circumstances,
but resolution of this will require full general relativistic numerical
simulations with no approximations.",2005-05-05T11:47:27Z
"Hypernovae, Black-Hole-Forming Supernovae, and First Stars","Recent studies of core-collapse supernovae have revealed the existence of two
distinct classes of massive supernovae (SNe): 1) very energetic SNe
(Hypernovae), whose kinetic energy (KE) exceeds $10^{52}$ erg, about 10 times
the KE of normal core-collapse SNe, and 2) very faint and low energy SNe (E <
0.5 $\times$ $10^{51}$ erg; Faint supernovae). These two classes of supernovae
are likely to be ""black-hole-forming"" supernovae with rotating or non-rotating
black holes. We compare their nucleosynthesis yields with the abundances of
extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars to identify the Pop III (or first) supernovae.
We show that the EMP stars, especially the C-rich type, are likely to be
enriched by black-hole-forming supernovae.",2005-06-24T14:11:09Z
Galaxy formation and cosmic-ray acceleration in a magnetized universe,"We study the linear magneto-hydrodynamical behaviour of a Newtonian cosmology
with a viscous magnetized fluid of finite conductivity and generalise the Jeans
instability criterion. The presence of the field favors the anisotropic
collapse of the fluid, which in turn leads to further magnetic amplification
and to an enhanced current-sheet formation in the plane normal to the ambient
magnetic field. When the currents exceed a certain threshold, the resulting
electrostatic turbulence can dramatically amplify the resistivity of the medium
(anomalous resistivity). This could trigger strong electric fields and
subsequently the acceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) during
the formation of protogalactic structures.",2005-06-29T21:31:09Z
Using gravitational-wave standard sirens,"Gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black hole (BBH) inspirals
are potentially powerful standard sirens (the GW analog to standard candles)
(Schutz 1986, 2002). Because these systems are well-modeled, the space-based GW
observatory LISA will be able to measure the luminosity distance (but not the
redshift) to some distant massive BBH systems with 1-10% accuracy. This
accuracy is largely limited by pointing error: GW sources generally are poorly
localized on the sky. Localizing the binary independently (e.g., through
association with an electromagnetic counterpart) greatly reduces this
positional error. An electromagnetic counterpart may also allow determination
of the event's redshift. In this case, BBH coalescence would constitute an
extremely precise (better than 1%) standard candle visible to high redshift. In
practice, gravitational lensing degrades this precision, though the candle
remains precise enough to provide useful information about the
distance-redshift relation. Even if very rare, these GW standard sirens would
complement, and increase confidence in, other standard candles.",2005-04-27T20:22:30Z
"Accretion in dipole magnetic fields: flow structure and X-ray emission
  of accreting white dwarfs","Field-channelled accretion flows occur in a variety of astrophysical objects,
including T Tauri stars,magnetic cataclysmic variables and X-ray pulsars. We
consider a curvilinear coordinate system and derive a general hydrodynamic
formulation for accretion onto stellar objects confined by a stellar dipole
magnetic field. The hydrodynamic equations are solved to determine the
velocity, density and temperature profiles of the flow. We use accreting
magnetic white-dwarf stars as an illustrative example of astrophysical
applications. Our calculations show that the compressional heating due to the
field geometry is as important as radiative cooling and gravity in determining
the structure of the post-shock flow in accreting white-dwarf stars. The
generalisation of the formulation to accretion flows channelled by higher-order
fields and the applications to other astrophysical systems are discussed.",2005-04-04T08:48:24Z
"Variability of Broad and Blueshifted Component of [OIII]$λ$5007 in
  IZWI","Although the existence of asymmetrical profile of [OIII]$\lambda$5007 has
been discovered for ages, its filiation and physics are poorly understood. Two
new spectra of I ZWI taken on Nov 16, 2001 and on Dec 3, 2002 were compared
with the spectra taken by BG92. Following results are obtained. 1)The certain
variations of broad [OIII] during about 10 years separating the observations
are identified. The inferred length scale of broad [OIII] emitting region
ranges from 0.3pc to 3pc. By assuming a Keplerian motion in emitting region,
the material emitting broad [OIII] is likely to be located at transient
emission line region, between BLR and NLR. 2)We find a positive relation
between the FeII emission and flux of H$\beta$(or continuum). On the other
hand, the parameter RFe decreases with ionizing continuum marginally. 3)We
detect a low ionized NLR in I ZWI, because of the low flux ratios
$\rm{[OIII]_{n}/H\beta_{n}}$($\sim1.7$).",2005-04-04T18:31:57Z
"A Persistent High-Energy Flux from the Heart of the Milky Way :
  Integral's view of the Galactic Center","The Ibis/Isgri imager on Integral detected for the first time a hard X-ray
source, IGR J17456-2901, located within 1' of Sgr A* over the energy range
20-100 keV. Here we present the results of a detailed analysis of ~7 Ms of
Integral observations of the GC. With an effective exposure of 4.7 Ms we have
obtained more stringent positional constraints on this HE source and
constructed its spectrum in the range 20-400 keV. Furthermore, by combining the
Isgri spectrum with the total X-ray spectrum corresponding to the same physical
region around SgrA* from XMM data, and collected during part of the Integral
observations, we constructed and present the first accurate wide band HE
spectrum for the central arcmins of the Galaxy. Our complete analysis of the
emission properties of IGR shows that it is faint but persistent with no
variability above 3 sigma contrary to what was alluded to in our first paper.
This result, in conjunction with the spectral characteristics of the X-ray
emission from this region, suggests that the source is most likely not
point-like but, rather, that it is a compact, yet diffuse, non-thermal emission
region. The centroid of IGR is estimated to be R.A.=17h45m42.5,
decl.=-28deg59'28'', offset by 1' from the radio position of Sgr A* and with a
positional uncertainty of 1'. Its 20-400 keV luminosity at 8 kpc is L=5.4x10^35
erg/sec. Very recently, Hess detected of a source of ~TeV g-rays also located
within 1' of Sgr A*. We present arguments in favor of an interpretation
according to which the photons detected by Integral and Hess arise from the
same compact region of diffuse emission near the central BH and that the
supernova remnant Sgr A East could play an important role as a contributor of
very HE g-rays to the overall spectrum from this region.",2005-08-04T12:45:02Z
WIMPs search by means of the highly segmented scintillator,"The highly sensitive method to search for WIMPs dark matter particles is
proposed. An array of thin NaI(Tl) plate has the great selectivity for
distinguishing the WIMPs events and background ones. The principle of signal
selection for WIMPs is described. The high sensitivity for SD (spin-dependent)
type WIMPs is expected by applying multi-layer system of NaI(Tl) detector.",2005-06-15T00:56:25Z
"The Solar Neighborhood XV: Discovery of New High Proper Motion Stars
  with mu >= 0.4""/yr between Declinations -47 degrees and 00 degrees","We report the discovery of 152 new high proper motion systems (mu >= 0.4""/yr)
in the southern sky (Declination = -47 degrees to 00 degrees) brighter than
UKST plate R_{59F} =16.5 via our SuperCOSMOS-RECONS (SCR) search. This paper
complements Paper XII in The Solar Neighborhood series, which covered the
region from Declination = -90 degrees to -47 degrees and discussed all 147 new
systems from the southernmost phase of the search. Among the total of 299
systems from both papers, there are 148 (71 in Paper XII, 77 in this paper) new
systems moving faster than 0.5""/yr that are additions to the classic ``LHS''
(Luyten Half Second) sample. These constitute an 8% increase in the sample of
all stellar systems with mu >= 0.5""/yr in the southern sky.
  As in Paper XII, distance estimates are provided for the systems reported
here based upon a combination of photographic plate magnitudes and 2MASS
photometry, assuming all stars are on the main sequence. Two SCR systems from
the portion of the sky included in this paper are anticipated to be within 10
pc, and an additional 23 are within 25 pc. In total, the results presented in
Paper XII and here for this SCR sweep of the entire southern sky include five
new systems within 10 pc and 38 more between 10 and 25 pc. The largest number
of nearby systems have been found in the slowest proper motion bin, 0.6""/yr >
mu >= 0.4""/yr, indicating that there may be a large population of low proper
motion systems very near the Sun.",2005-06-29T17:09:11Z
"Observations of the binary pulsar system PSR B1718-19 -- The Role of
  Tidal Circularisation","We present optical and infrared observations taken with the Very Large
Telescope of the eclipsing binary pulsar system PSR B1718-19. The candidate
companion of the pulsar, identified earlier in Hubble Space Telescope
observations, has been detected in all three bands, R, I, and J. These
detections allowed us to derive constraints on temperature, radius, and mass,
pointing to a companion that has expanded to a radius between one of a main
sequence star and one at the Roche-limit. We focus on the role of tidal
circularisation in the system, which will have transformed the initially
eccentric orbit expected from formation scenarios into the nearly circular
orbit presently observed. Based on simple energy balance arguments, we are able
to draw a picture of the companion's evolution resulting from the energy
deposition in the star due to circularisation. In this picture, our measurement
of the companion's parameters is consistent with the expected initial
eccentricity. However, with the present understanding of tidal dissipation it
remains difficult to account for the short time in which the system was
circularised.",2005-04-11T04:24:20Z
"Magnetized Sources of Ultra-high Energy Nuclei and Extragalactic Origin
  of the Ankle","It has recently been suggested that ultra-high energy cosmic rays could have
an extragalactic origin down to the ""second knee"" at ~4x10^{17}eV. In this case
the ""ankle"" or ""dip"" at ~5x10^{18}eV would be due to pair production of
extragalactic protons on the cosmic microwave background which requires an
injection spectrum of about E^{-2.6}. It has been pointed out that for
injection of a mixed composition of nuclei a harder injection spectrum
\~E^{-2.2} is required to fit the spectra at the highest energies and a
galactic component is required in this case to fit the spectrum below the
ankle, unless the proton fraction is larger than 85%. Here we perform numerical
simulations and find that for sufficiently magnetized sources, observed spectra
above 10^{19}eV approach again the case of pure proton injection due to
increased path-lengths and more efficient photo-disintegration of nuclei around
the sources. This decreases secondary fluxes at a given energy and thus
requires injection spectra ~E^{-2.6}, as steep as for pure proton injection. In
addition, the ankle may again be sufficiently dominated by protons to be
interpreted as a pair production dip.",2005-07-28T16:56:24Z
Inflationary Solutions in Nonminimally Coupled Scalar Field Theory,"We study analytically and numerically the inflationary solutions for various
type scalar potentials in the nonminimally coupled scalar field theory. The
Hamilton-Jacobi equation is used to deal with nonlinear evolutions of
inhomogeneous spacetimes and the long-wavelength approximation is employed. The
constraints that lead to a sufficient inflation are found for the nonminimal
coupling constant and initial conditions of the scalar field for inflation
potentials. In particular, we numerically find an inflationary solution in the
new inflation model of a nonminimal scalar field.",2005-05-10T12:10:48Z
"Hydrodynamical simulations of the decay of high-speed molecular
  turbulence. II. Divergence from isothermality","A roughly constant temperature over a wide range of densities is maintained
in molecular clouds through radiative heating and cooling. An isothermal
equation of state is therefore frequently employed in molecular cloud
simulations. However, the dynamical processes in molecular clouds include shock
waves, expansion waves, cooling induced collapse and baroclinic vorticity, all
incompatible with the assumption of a purely isothermal flow. Here, we
incorporate an energy equation including all the important heating and cooling
rates and a simple chemical network into simulations of three-dimensional,
hydrodynamic, decaying turbulence. This allows us to test the accuracy of the
isothermal assumption by directly comparing a model run with the modified
energy equation to an isothermal model. We compute an extreme case in which the
initial turbulence is sufficiently strong to dissociate much of the gas and
alter the specific heat ratio. The molecules then reform as the turbulence
weakens. We track the true specific heat ratio as well as its effective value.
We analyse power spectra, vorticity and shock structures, and discuss scaling
laws for decaying turbulence. We derive some limitations to the isothermal
approximation for simulations of the interstellar medium using simple
projection techniques. Overall, even given the extreme conditions, we find that
an isothermal flow provides an adequate physical and observational description
of many properties. The main exceptions revealed here concern behaviour
directly related to the high temperature zones behind the shock waves.",2005-04-22T16:36:33Z
How far do they go? The outer structure of dark matter halos,"We study the density profiles of collapsed galaxy-size dark matter halos with
masses 1e11-5e12 Msun focusing mostly on the halo outer regions from the formal
virial radius Rvir up to 5-7Rvir. We find that isolated halos in this mass
range extend well beyond Rvir exhibiting all properties of virialized objects
up to 2-3Rvir: relatively smooth density profiles and no systematic infall
velocities. The dark matter halos in this mass range do not grow as one naively
may expect through a steady accretion of satellites, i.e., on average there is
no mass infall. This is strikingly different from more massive halos, which
have large infall velocities outside of the virial radius. We provide accurate
fit for the density profile of these galaxy-size halos. For a wide range
(0.01-2)Rvir of radii the halo density profiles are fit with the approximation
rho=rho_s exp(-2n[x^{1/n}-1])+rho_m, where x=r/r_s, rho_m is the mean matter
density of the Universe, and the index n is in the range n=6-7.5. These
profiles do not show a sudden change of behavior beyond the virial radius. For
larger radii we combine the statistics of the initial fluctuations with the
spherical collapse model to obtain predictions for the mean and most probable
density profiles for halos of several masses. The model give excellent results
beyond 2-3 formal virial radii.",2005-06-17T23:52:27Z
"Oligarchic and giant impact growth of terrestrial planets in the
  presence of gas giant planet migration","We present the results of N--body simulations which examine the effect that
gas giant planet migration has on the formation of terrestrial planets. The
models incorporate a 0.5 Jupiter mass planet undergoing type II migration
through an inner protoplanet--planetesimal disk, with gas drag included. Each
model is initiated with the inner disk being at successively increased levels
of maturity, so that it is undergoing either oligarchic or giant impact style
growth as the gas giant migrates. In all cases, a large fraction of the disk
mass survives the passage of the giant, either by accreting into massive
terrestrial planets shepherded inward of the giant, or by being scattered into
external orbits. Shepherding is favored in younger disks where there is strong
dynamical friction from planetesimals and gas drag is more influential, whereas
scattering dominates in more mature disks where dissipation is weaker. In each
scenario, sufficient mass is scattered outward to provide for the eventual
accretion of a set of terrestrial planets in external orbits, including within
the system's habitable zone. An interesting result is the generation of
massive, short period, terrestrial planets from compacted material pushed ahead
of the giant. These planets are reminiscent of the short period Neptune mass
planets discovered recently, suggesting that such `hot Neptunes' could form
locally as a by-product of giant planet migration.",2005-07-07T19:45:09Z
On the Rotation Period of (90377) Sedna,"We present precise, ~1%, r-band relative photometry of the unusual solar
system object (90377) Sedna. Our data consist of 143 data points taken over
eight nights in October 2004 and January 2005. The RMS variability over the
longest contiguous stretch of five nights of data spanning nine days is only
1.3%. This subset of data alone constrain the amplitude of any long-period
variations with period P to be A<1% (P/20 days)^2. Over the course of any given
5-hour segment, the data exhibits significant linear trends not seen in a
comparison star of similar magnitude, and in a few cases these segments show
clear evidence for curvature at the level of a few millimagnitudes per hour^2.
These properties imply that the rotation period of Sedna is O(10 hours), cannot
be < 5 hours, and cannot be >10 days, unless the intrinsic light curve has
significant and comparable power on multiple timescales, which is unlikely. A
sinusoidal fit yields a period of P=(10.273 +/- 0.002) hours and semi-amplitude
of A=(1.1 +/- 0.1)%. There are additional acceptable fits with flanking periods
separated by ~3 minutes, as well as another class of fits with P ~ 18 hours,
although these later fits appear less viable based on visual inspection. Our
results indicate that the period of Sedna is likely consistent with typical
rotation periods of solar system objects, thus obviating the need for a massive
companion to slow its rotation.",2005-03-30T21:56:58Z
Where are the X-ray QPOs in active galaxies?,"In this paper we address the question of whether existing X-ray observations
of Seyfert galaxies are sufficiently sensitive to detect quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) similar to those observed in the X-ray variations of
Galactic Black Holes (GBHs). We use data from XMM-Newton and simulated data
based on the best RXTE long-term monitoring light curves, to show that if X-ray
QPOs are present in Seyfert X-ray light curves - with similar shapes and
strengths to those observed in GBHs, but at lower frequencies commensurate with
their larger black hole masses - they would be exceedingly difficult to detect.
Our results offer a simple explanation for the present lack of QPO detections
in Seyferts. We discuss the improvements in telescope size and monitoring
patterns needed to make QPO detections feasible. The most efficient type of
future observatory for searching for X-ray QPOs in AGN is an X-ray All-Sky
Monitor (ASM). A sufficiently sensitive ASM would be ideally suited to
detecting low frequency QPOs in nearby AGN. The detection of AGN QPOs would
strengthen the AGN-GBH connection and could serve as powerful diagnostics of
the black hole mass, and the structure of the X-ray emitting region in AGN.",2005-06-20T14:02:30Z
"Could the 47 UMa Planetary System be a Second Solar System: predicting
  the Earth-like planets","(Abridged)We numerically investigated the dynamical architecture of 47 UMa
with the planetary configuration of the best-fit orbital solutions by Fischer
et al. We systematically studied the existence of Earth-like planets in the
region 0.05 AU $\leq a \leq 2.0$ AU for 47 UMa with numerical simulations, and
we also explored the packed planetary geometry and Trojan planets in the
system. In the simulations, we found that ""hot Earths"" at 0.05 AU $\leq a < $
0.4 AU can dynamically survive at least for 1 Myr. The Earth-like planets can
eventually remain in the system for 10 Myr in areas involved in the mean motion
resonances (MMR) (e.g., 3:2 MMR) with the inner companion. Moreover, we showed
that the 2:1 and 3:1 resonances are on the fringe of stability, while the 5:2
MMR is unstable. Additionally, the 2:1 MMR marks out a remarkable boundary
between chaotic and regular motions, inside, most of the orbits can survive,
outside, they are mostly lost in the orbital evolution. In a dynamical sense,
the most likely candidate for habitable environment is Earth-like planets with
orbits in the ranges 0.8 AU $\leq a < 1.0$ AU and 1.0 AU $ < a < 1.30$ AU
(except several unstable cases) with relatively low eccentricities. The Trojan
planets with low eccentricities and inclinations can secularly last at the
triangular equilibrium points of two massive planets. Hence, the 47 UMa
planetary system may be a close analog to our solar system.",2005-06-16T08:42:39Z
Near-Infrared water lines in V838 Monocerotis,"V838 Monocerotis had an intriguing, nova-like outburst in January 2002 which
has subsequently led to several studies of the object. It is now recognized
that the outburst of V838 Mon and its evolution are different from that of a
classical nova or other classes of well-known eruptive variables. V838 Mon,
along with two other objects that have analogous properties, appears to
comprise a new class of eruptive variables. There are limited infrared studies
of V838 Mon. Here, we present near-infrared H band (1.5 - 1.75micron) spectra
of V838 Mon from late 2002 to the end of 2004. The principal, new result from
our work is the detection of several, rotation-vibration lines of water in the
H band spectra. The observed water lines have been modeled to first establish
that they are indeed due to water. Subsequently the temperature and column
densities of the absorbing material, from where the water absorption features
originate, are derived. From our analysis, we find that the water features
arise from a cool ~750-900 K region around V838 Mon which appears to be
gradually cooling with time.",2005-06-17T03:41:51Z
"The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: Dynamically Close Galaxy Pairs and the
  Global Merger Rate","We derive the number of dynamically close companions per galaxy ($N_c$) and
their total luminosity ($L_c$) for galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue:
$N_c$ is similar to the fraction of galaxies in close pairs and is directly
related to the galaxy merger rate. We find $N_c=0.0174 \pm 0.0015$ and
$L_c=(252 \pm 30) \times 10^6$ $L_{\odot}$ for galaxies with $-22 < M_B -5 \log
h < -19$ with $<z>=0.123$ and $N_c=0.0357 \pm 0.0027$, $L_c= (294 \pm 31)
\times 10^6 L_{\odot}$ for galaxies with $-21 < M_B -5 \log h < -18$, with
$<z>=0.116$. The integrated merger rate to $z=1$ for both samples is about 20
%, but this depends sensitively on the fraction of kinematic pairs that are
truly undergoing a merger (assumed here to be 50%), the evolution of the merger
rate (here as $(1+z)^3$) and the adopted timescale for mergers (0.2 and 0.5 Gyr
for each sample, respectively). Galaxies involved in mergers tend to be
marginally bluer than non-interacting galaxies and show an excess of both
early-type and very late-type objects and a deficiency of intermediate-type
spirals. This suggests that interactions and mergers partly drive the star
formation and morphological evolution of galaxies.",2005-06-27T09:45:33Z
Precession of the Isolated Neutron Star PSR B1828-11,"Stairs, Lyne & Shemar have found that arrival time residuals from PSR
B1828-11 vary periodically with a period of 500 days. This behavior can be
accounted for by precession of the radiopulsar, an interpretation that is
reinforced by the detection of variations in its pulse profile on the same
timescale. Here, we model the period residuals from PSR B1828-11 in terms of
precession of a triaxial rigid body. We include two contributions to the
residuals: (i) the geometric effect, which arises because the times at which
the pulsar emission beam points toward the observer varies with precession
phase; (ii) the spindown contribution, which arises from any dependence of the
spindown torque acting on the pulsar on the angle between its spin and magnetic
axes. We use the data to probe numerous properties of the pulsar, most notably
its shape, and the dependence of its spindown torque on the angle between its
spin and magnetic axes, for which we assume a sum of a spin-aligned component
(with a weight 1-a) and a dipolar component perpendicular to the magnetic beam
axis (weight a), rather than the vacuum dipole torque (a=1). We find that a
variety of shapes are consistent with the residuals, with a slight statistical
preference for a prolate star. Moreover, a range of torque possibilities fit
the data equally well, with no strong preference for the vacuum model. In the
case of a prolate star we find evidence for an angle-dependent spindown torque.
Our results show that the combination of geometrical and spin-down effects
associated with precession can account for the principal features of PSR
B1828-11's timing behavior, without fine tuning of the parameters.",2005-06-24T18:59:38Z
Microlensing in the double quasar SBS1520+530,"We present the results of a monitoring campaign of the double quasar
SBS1520+530 at Maidanak observatory from April 2003 to August 2004. We obtained
light curves in V and R filters that show small-amplitude \Delta m~0.1 mag
intrinsic variations of the quasar on time scales of about 100 days. The data
set is consistent with the previously determined time delay of \Delta
t=(130+-3) days by Burud et al. (2002). We find that the time delay corrected
magnitude difference between the quasar images is now larger by (0.14+-0.03)
mag than during the observations by Burud et al. (2002). This confirms the
presence of gravitational microlensing variations in this system.",2005-05-24T13:25:26Z
The cool wake around 4C 34.16 as seen by XMM-Newton,"We present XMM-Newton observations of the wake-radiogalaxy system 4C34.16,
which shows a cool and dense wake trailing behind 4C34.16's host galaxy. A
comparison with numerical simulations is enlightening, as they demonstrate that
the wake is produced mainly by ram pressure stripping during the galactic
motion though the surrounding cluster. The mass of the wake is a substantial
fraction of the mass of an elliptical galaxy's X-ray halo. This observational
fact supports a wake formation scenario similar to the one demonstrated
numerically by Acreman et al (2003): the host galaxy of 4C34.16 has fallen into
its cluster, and is currently crossing its central regions. A substantial
fraction of its X-ray halo has been stripped by ram pressure, and remains
behind to form the galaxy wake.",2005-04-19T19:16:07Z
"An Asymmetric, Energetic Type Ic Supernova Viewed Off-Axis, and a Link
  to Gamma-Ray Bursts","Type Ic supernovae, the explosions following the core collapse of massive
stars that have previously lost their hydrogen and helium envelopes, are
particularly interesting because of the link with long-duration gamma-ray
bursts. Although indications exist that these explosions are aspherical, direct
evidence has still been missing. Late-time observations of SN 2003jd, a
luminous Type Ic supernova, provide such evidence. Recent Subaru and Keck
spectra reveal double-peaked profiles in the nebular lines of neutral oxygen
and magnesium. These profiles are different from those of known Type Ic
supernovae, with or without a gamma-ray burst, and they can be understood if SN
2003jd was an aspherical, axisymmetric explosion viewed from near the
equatorial plane. If SN 2003jd was associated with a gamma-ray burst, we missed
the burst as it was pointing away from us.",2005-05-10T17:54:08Z
Radiation in the process of the formation of voids,"This paper aims to investigate the influence of inhomogeneous radiation in
void formation. Since the process of void formation is non-linear, a fully
relativistic model, which simulates the evolution of voids from the moment of
the last scattering until the present instant, is presented. It is found that
in order to obtain a model of a void which evolves from $\delta_0 = - 10^{-5}$
at the last scattering moment to the present day $\delta = - 0.94$, the
existence of radiation must be taken into account. The ratio of radiation
energy density to matter energy density in CDM models at the moment of last
scattering is 1/5. This paper proves that such a value of radiation energy
density cannot be neglected and influences the first stages of void evolution.
Namely, it is important to the process of structure formation and hence
significantly influences the dynamics of the Universe in the first millions of
years after the last scattering.
  From the fact that the evolution of voids proceeds differently in various
cosmological background models we use the process of void formation to put some
limits on values of cosmological parameters. We find that the model with
$\Omega_{mat} \approx 0.3$ fits the observational data best.",2005-03-16T17:26:41Z
Covariant Kinetic Theory with an Application to the Coma Cluster,"In this paper, we introduce a novel solution to the covariant Landau equation
for a pure electron plasma. The method conserves energy and particle number,
and reduces smoothly to the Rosenbluth potentials of non-relativistic theory.
In addition, we find that a fully relativistic plasma equilibrates in only
1/100th of a Spitzer time--much faster than in the non-relativistic limit--a
factor of significant import to situations in which distortions to a Maxwellian
distribution are produced by anomalous methods of acceleration. To demonstrate
the power of our solution in dealing with hot, astrophysical plasmas, we use
this technique to show that one of the currently considered models--continuous
stochastic acceleration--for the hard X-ray emission in the Coma cluster
actually cannot work because the energy gained by the particles is distributed
to the {\it whole} plasma on a time scale much shorter than that of the
acceleration process itself.",2005-05-02T20:27:59Z
Spectroscopic metallicities for planet-host stars: extending the samples,"We present stellar parameters and metallicities for 29 planet-host stars, as
well as for a large volume-limited sample of 53 stars not known to be orbited
by any planetary-mass companion. These stars add to the results presented in
our previous series of papers, providing two large and uniform samples of 119
planet-hosts and 94 ``single'' stars with accurate stellar parameters and
[Fe/H] estimates. The analysis of the results further confirms that stars with
planets are metal-rich when compared with average field dwarfs. Important
biases that may compromise future studies are also discussed. Finally, we
compare the metallicity distributions for single planet-hosts and planet-hosts
in multiple stellar systems. The results show that a small difference cannot be
excluded, in the sense that the latter sample is slighly overmetallic. However,
more data are needed to confirm this correlation.",2005-04-06T18:21:04Z
Anti-GZK effect in UHECR spectrum,"In this paper we discuss the anti-GZK effect that arises in the framework of
the diffusive propagation of Ultra High Energy (UHE) protons. This effect
consists in a jump-like increase of the maximum distance from which UHE protons
can reach the observer. The position of the jump is independent of the
Intergalactic Magnetic Field (IMF) strength and depends only on the energy
losses of protons, namely on the transition energy from adiabatic and
pair-production energy losses. The Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR)
spectrum presents a low-energy steepening approximately at this energy, which
is very close to the position of the observed second knee. The dip, seen in the
universal spectrum as a signature of the proton interaction with the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, is also present in the case of diffusive
propagation in magnetic fields.",2005-07-13T15:47:15Z
"The 2dF QSO Redshift Survey - XV. Correlation analysis of redshift-Space
  distortions","We analyse the redshift-space (z-space) distortions of QSO clustering in the
2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ). To interpret the z-space correlation function,
xi(sigma,pi), we require an accurate model for the QSO real-space correlation
function, xi(r). Although a single power-law xi(r) model fits the projected
correlation function (wp(sigma)) at small scales, it implies somewhat too
shallow a slope for both wp(sigma) and the z-space correlation function, xi(s),
at larger scales > 20 h^(-1) Mpc. Motivated by the form for xi(r) seen in the
2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and in standard LCDM predictions, we use a
double power-law model for xi(r) which gives a good fit to xi(s) and wp(sigma).
The model is parametrized by a slope of gamma=1.45 for 1<r<10 h^(-1) Mpc and
gamma=2.30 for 10<r<40 h^(-1) Mpc. As found for 2dFGRS, the value of beta
determined from the ratio of xi(s)/xi(r) depends sensitively on the form of
xi(r) assumed. With our double power-law form for xi(r), we measure
beta(z=1.4)=0.32(+0.09)(-0.11). Assuming the same model for xi(r) we then
analyse the z-space distortions in the 2QZ xi(sigma,pi) and put constraints on
the values of Omega m and beta(z=1.4), using an improved version of the method
of Hoyle et al. The constraints we derive are Omega m=0.35(+0.19)(-0.13),
beta(z=1.4)=0.50(+0.13)(-0.15), in agreement with our xi(s)/\xi(r) results at
the ~1 sigma level.",2005-04-20T12:43:22Z
Deuterium depletion and magnesium enhancement in the local disc,"The local disc deuter is known to be depleted in comparison to the local
bubble. We show, that the same lines of sight that are depleted in deuter, are
enhanced in magnesium. Heavier elements - Si and Fe do not show any difference
in the abundance between the local disc and the local bubble. This observation
implicates that astration is responsible for both deuter depletion and
magnesium enhancement.",2005-07-19T09:29:09Z
"Subaru Super Deep Field with Adaptive Optics I. Observations and First
  Implications","We present a deep $K^{\prime}$-band (2.12$\mu$m) imaging of 1\arcmin\
$\times$ 1\arcmin Subaru Super Deep Field (SSDF) taken with the Subaru adaptive
optics (AO) system. Total integration time of 26.8 hours results in the
limiting magnitude of $K^{\prime} \sim 24.7$ (5$\sigma$, 0\farcs2 aperture) for
point sources and $K^{\prime} \sim 23.5$ (5$\sigma$, 0\farcs6 aperture) for
galaxies, which is the deepest limit ever achieved in the $K^{\prime}$ band.
The average stellar FWHM of the co-added image is 0\farcs18. Based on the
photometric measurements of detected galaxies, we obtained the differential
galaxy number counts, for the first time, down to $K^{\prime} \sim 25$, which
is more than 0.5 mag deeper than the previous data. We found that the number
count slope $d\log N/dm$ is about 0.15 at $22 < K^{\prime} < 25$, which is
flatter than the previous data. Therefore, detected galaxies in the SSDF have
only negligible contribution to the near-infrared extragalactic background
light (EBL), and the discrepancy claimed so far between the diffuse EBL
measurements and the estimated EBL from galaxy count integration has become
more serious . The size distribution of detected galaxies was obtained down to
the area size of less than 0.1 arcsec$^2$, which is less than a half of the
previous data in the $K^{\prime}$ band. We compared the observed size-magnitude
relation with a simple pure luminosity evolution model allowing for intrinsic
size evolution, and found that a model with no size evolution gives the best
fit to the data. It implies that the surface brightness of galaxies at high
redshift is not much different from that expected from the size-luminosity
relation of present-day galaxies.",2005-05-17T15:12:42Z
"Observational Constraints Upon Cool Disk Material in Quiescent Black
  Hole Binaries","We consider current observational constraints on the presence of cool,
optically thick disk material in quiescent black hole binaries, specifically
focusing on a case study of the prototypical system A0620-00. Such material
might be expected to be present theoretically, but is usually claimed to make a
negligible contribution at optical and infrared wavelengths. The primary
argument is based on measurements of the veiling of stellar photospheric
absorption lines, in which it is assumed that the disk spectrum is featureless.
We use simulated spectra to explore the sensitivity of veiling measurements to
uncertainties in companion temperature, gravity, and metallicity. We find that
the derived veiling is extremely sensitive to a mismatch between the
temperature and metallicity of the companion and template, but that the effect
of a plausible gravity mismatch is much smaller. In general the resulting
uncertainty in the amount of veiling is likely to be much larger than the
usually quoted statistical uncertainty. We also simulate spectra in which the
disk has an emergent spectrum similar to the star and find that in this case,
optical veiling constraints are moderately robust. This is because the
rotational broadening of the disk is so large that the two line profiles
effectively decouple and the measurement of the depth of stellar lines is
largely unbiased by the disk component. We note, however, that this is only
true at intermediate resolutions or higher, and that significant bias might
still affect low resolution IR observations. [Abridged]",2005-07-19T21:32:07Z
"New clues on outburst mechanisms and improved spectroscopic elements of
  the black-hole binary V4641 Sagittarii","We present spectroscopic observations of the black-hole binary V4641
Sagittarii, obtained between 4th July 2004 and 28th March 2005, which cover the
minor outburst of the star in early July 2004 and quiescence variations on 19
nights scattered over six months. During the outburst, the star peaked
approximately 3 magnitudes brighter than usual, and our spectra were dominated
by broad hydrogen, helium and iron emission lines. The very first spectra
showed P Cygni profiles, which disappeared within a few hours, indicating rapid
changes in matter ejection. The H-alpha line had multiple components, one being
a broad blue-shifted wing exceeding 5000 km/s. During a simultaneously observed
10-min photometric flare-up, the equivalent width of the H-alpha line
temporarily decreased, implying that it was a flare of the continuum. The
overall spectral appearance was similar to that observed in the 1999 September
active phase, which suggests that similar mass-ejection processes were
associated with both eruptions. In quiescence, the spectra were those of the
early-type secondary star showing its orbital motion around the primary. By
measuring cross-correlation radial velocities, we give an improved set of
spectroscopic elements. Whereas we measure the same velocity amplitude
(K_2=211.3+/-1.0 km/s), within errors, as Orosz et al. (2001), our
centre-of-mass velocity (v_gamma=72.7+/-3.3 km/s) differs significantly from
the previously published value (107.4+/-m2.9 km/s). However, we find evidence
that the difference is caused by a systematic error in data reduction in the
previous study, rather than by gravitational effects of an invisible third
component.",2005-08-03T00:53:30Z
Dynamical insight into dark-matter haloes,"We investigate, using the spherical Jeans equation, self-gravitating
dynamical equilibria satisfying a relation rho/sigma_r^3 propto r^-alpha, which
holds for simulated dark-matter haloes over their whole resolved radial range.
Considering first the case of velocity isotropy, we find that this problem has
only one solution with realistic density profile, which occurs only for a
critical value of alpha_crit = 35/18 ~= 1.94, which is consistent with the
empirical value of 1.9+/-0.05. We extend our analysis in two ways: first we
introduce a parameter epsilon to allow for a more general relation
rho/\sigma_r^epsilon propto r^-alpha; second we consider velocity anisotropy.
If we assume beta(r) := 1- sigma_theta^2 / sigma_r^2 to be linearly related to
the logarithmic density slope gamma(r) := -dln(rho)/dln(r), which is in
agreement with simulations, the problem remains analytically tractable and is
equivalent to the simpler isotropic case: there exists only one physical
solution, which occurs at a critical alpha value. Remarkably, this value of
alpha and the density and velocity-dispersion profiles depend only on epsilon
and the value beta_0 := beta(r=0), but not on the slope of the linear
beta-gamma relation. For epsilon=3, alpha_crit = 35/18 - 2beta_0/9 and the
resulting density profile is fully analytic (as are the velocity dispersion and
circular speed) with an inner cusp rho propto r^{-(7+10beta_0)/9} and a very
smooth transition to a steeper outer power-law asymptote. These models are in
excellent agreement with the density, velocity-dispersion and anisotropy
profiles of simulated dark-matter haloes over their full resolved radial range.
If epsilon=3 is a universal constant, some scatter in beta_0 ~= 0 may account
for some diversity in the density profiles. (ABRIDGED)",2005-06-22T08:44:35Z
"Black Hole Masses and Host Galaxy Evolution of Radio-loud Active
  Galactic Nuclei","We report stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of 28 AGN
host galaxies including our previous work. Using the mass-dispersion
($M_{\bullet}-\sigma$) and the fundamental plane relations, we estimate the
black hole mass for a sample of 66 BL Lac objects and investigate the role of
black hole mass in the energetics of BL Lac objects. The black hole mass range
for different BL Lac spectral types is similar, $10^{7} < M_{\bullet} < 4
\times 10^{9}$. Neither X-ray nor radio luminosity correlates with black hole
mass. Low-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects have higher Eddington ratios on
average, because of either more beaming or higher intrinsic power. For the
black hole mass range $3 \times 10^{7} < M_{\bullet} < 10^{9}$, the radio
luminosity of BL Lac objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars spans over 4
orders of magnitude, with BL Lac objects being low-power AGNs. We also
investigate the evolution of host galaxies for 39 AGNs out to $z \approx 0.5$
with measuredstellar velocity dispersions. Comparing the mass-to-light ratio
evolution in the observed frame with population synthesis models, we find that
single burst star formation models with $z_{form} = 1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.2} $ are
consistent with the observations. From our $z_{form}=1.4$ model, we estimated
the intrinsic mass-to-light ratio evolution in the Cousins $R$ band, $\Delta
log (M/L)/ \Delta z = -0.502 \pm 0.08$, consistent with that of normal early
type galaxies.",2005-06-14T19:16:41Z
Infrared Echoes near the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A,"Two images of Cassiopeia A obtained at 24 micrometer with the Spitzer Space
Telescope over a one year time interval show moving structures outside the
shell of the supernova remnant to a distance of more than 20 arcmin. Individual
features exhibit apparent motions of 10 to 20 arcsec per year, independently
confirmed by near-infrared observations. The observed tangential velocities are
at roughly the speed of light. It is likely that the moving structures are
infrared echoes, in which interstellar dust is heated by the explosion and by
flares from the compact object near the center of the remnant.",2005-06-08T20:25:48Z
"Atmosphere, Interior, and Evolution of the Metal-Rich Transiting Planet
  HD 149026b","We investigate the atmosphere and interior of the new transiting planet HD
149026b, which appears to be very rich in heavy elements. We first compute
model atmospheres at metallicities ranging from solar to ten times solar, and
show how for cases with high metallicity or inefficient redistribution of
energy from the day side, the planet may develop a hot stratosphere due to
absorption of stellar flux by TiO and VO. The spectra predicted by these models
are very different than cooler atmosphere models without stratospheres. The
spectral effects are potentially detectable with the Spitzer Space Telescope.
In addition the models with hot stratospheres lead to a large limb brightening,
rather than darkening. We compare the atmosphere of HD 149026b to other
well-known transiting planets, including the recently discovered HD 189733b,
which we show have planet-to-star flux ratios twice that of HD 209458 and
TrES-1. The methane abundance in the atmosphere of HD 189733b is a sensitive
indicator of atmospheric temperature and metallicity and can be constrained
with Spitzer IRAC observations. We then turn to interior studies of HD 149026b
and use a grid of self-consistent model atmospheres and high-pressure equations
of state for all components to compute thermal evolution models of the planet.
We estimate that the mass of heavy elements within the planet is in the range
of 60 to 93 M_earth. Finally, we discuss trends in the radii of transiting
planets with metallicity in light of this new member of the class.",2005-07-18T21:49:23Z
"The masses, radii and luminosities of the components of U Geminorum","We present a phase-resolved spectroscopic study of the secondary star in the
cataclysmic variable U Gem. We use our data to measure the radial velocity
semi-amplitude, systemic velocity and rotational velocity of the secondary
star. Combining this with literature data allows us to determine masses and
radii for both the secondary star and white dwarf which are independent of any
assumptions about their structure. We use these to compare their properties
with those of field stars and find that both components follow field
mass-radius relationships. The secondary star has the mass, radius, luminosity
and photometric temperature of an M2 star, but a spectroscopic temperature of
M4. The latter may well be due to a high metallicity. There is a troubling
inconsistency between the radius of the white dwarf inferred from its
gravitational redshift and inclination and that inferred from its temperature,
flux, and astrometric distance.
  We find that there are two fundamental limits to the accuracy of the
parameters we can derive. First the radial velocity curve of the secondary star
deviates from a sinusoid, in part because of its asphericity (which can be
modelled) and in part because the line flux is not evenly distributed over its
surface. Second we cannot be certain which spectral type is the best match for
the lines of the secondary star, and the derived rotational velocity is a
function of the spectral type of the template star used.",2005-06-15T17:14:30Z
"The Early (<1 hr) Multi-Color Afterglow of GRB 050502a: Possible
  Evidence for a Uniform Medium with Density Clumps","The 2-m robotic Liverpool Telescope reacted promptly to the gamma-ray burst
GRB 050502a discovered by INTEGRAL and started observing 3 min after the onset
of the GRB. The automatic identification of a bright afterglow of r'~15.8
triggered for the first time an observation sequence in the BVr'i' filters
during the first hour after a GRB. Observations continued for ~1 day using the
RoboNet-1.0 network of 2-m robotic telescopes. The light curve in all filters
can be described by a simple power law with index of 1.2 +/- 0.1. We find
evidence for a bump rising at t~0.02 days in all filters. From the spectrum and
the light curve we investigate different interpretative scenarios and we find
possible evidence for a uniform circumburst medium with clumps in density, as
in the case of GRB 021004. Other interpretations of such bumps, such as the
effect of energy injection through refreshed shocks or the result of a variable
energy profile, are less favored. The optical afterglow of GRB 050502a is
likely to be the result of slow electron cooling with the optical bands lying
between the synchrotron peak frequency and the cooling frequency.",2005-07-27T15:19:22Z
Cool Dark Cosmic Dust as a Reservoir of Absorbed Energy,"The conception of cool dark cosmic dust has been proposed. The process of
accumulation of absorbed energy by dust of such kind is considered. The
conception of accumulation horizon is introduced. The possible role of cool

other aspects of the problem are also considered.",2005-07-22T06:03:47Z
Mass-Varying Neutrinos from a Variable Cosmological Constant,"We consider, in a completely model-independent way, the transfer of energy
between the components of the dark energy sector consisting of the cosmological
constant (CC) and that of relic neutrinos. We show that such a cosmological
setup may promote neutrinos to mass-varying particles, thus resembling a
recently proposed scenario of Fardon, Nelson, and Weiner (FNW), but now without
introducing any acceleronlike scalar fields. Although a formal similarity of
the FNW scenario with the variable CC one can be easily established, one
nevertheless finds different laws for neutrino mass variation in each scenario.
We show that as long as the neutrino number density dilutes canonically, only a
very slow variation of the neutrino mass is possible. For neutrino masses to
vary significantly (as in the FNW scenario), a considerable deviation from the
canonical dilution of the neutrino number density is also needed. We note that
the present `coincidence' between the dark energy density and the neutrino
energy density can be obtained in our scenario even for static neutrino masses.",2005-05-25T10:59:41Z
Stringy Dark Energy Model with Cold Dark Matter,"Cosmological consequences of adding the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) to the exactly
solvable stringy Dark Energy (DE) model are investigated. The model is
motivated by the consideration of our Universe as a slowly decaying D3-brane.
The decay of this D-brane is described in the String Field Theory framework.
Stability conditions of the exact solution with respect to small fluctuations
of the initial value of the CDM energy density are found. Solutions with large
initial value of the CDM energy density attracted by the exact solution without
CDM are constructed numerically. In contrast to the LambdaCDM model the Hubble
parameter in the model is not a monotonic function of time. For specific
initial data the DE state parameter w_{DE} is also not monotonic function of
time. For these cases there are two separate regions of time where w_{DE} being
less than -1 is close to -1.",2005-05-30T17:36:38Z
"A Statistical Study of Threshold Rotation Rates for the Formation of
  Disks around Be Stars","This paper presents a detailed statistical determination of the equatorial
rotation rates of classical Be stars. The rapid rotation of Be stars is likely
to be linked to the ejection of gas that forms dense circumstellar disks. The
physical origins of these disks are not understood, though it is generally
believed that the ability to spin up matter into a Keplerian disk depends on
how close the stellar rotation speed is to the critical speed at which the
centrifugal force cancels gravity. There has been recent disagreement between
the traditional idea that Be stars rotate between 50 and 80 percent of their
critical speeds and new ideas (inspired by the tendency for gravity darkening
to mask rapid rotation at the equator) that their rotation may be very nearly
critical. This paper utilizes Monte Carlo forward modeling to simulate
distributions of the projected rotation speed (v sin i), taking into account
gravity darkening, limb darkening, and observational uncertainties. A
chi-squared minimization procedure was used to find the distribution parameters
that best reproduce observed v sin i distributions from R. Yudin's database.
Early-type (O7e-B2e) Be stars were found to exhibit a roughly uniform spread of
intrinsic rotation speed that extends from 40 to 60 percent up to 100 percent
of critical. Late-type (B3e-A0e) Be stars exhibit progressively narrower ranges
of rotation speed as the effective temperature decreases; the lower limit rises
to reach critical rotation for the coolest Be stars. The derived lower limits
on equatorial rotation speed represent conservative threshold rotation rates
for the onset of the Be phenomenon. The significantly subcritical speeds found
for early-type Be stars represent strong constraints on physical models of
angular momentum deposition in Be star disks.",2005-07-29T19:41:00Z
Skyrmion Stars: Astrophysical motivations and implications,"We study mass-radius relations for compact stars employing an equation of
state (EOS) of dense matter based on a Skyrme fluid. The zero-temperature
mean-field model is based on mesonic excitations, incorporates the scale
breaking of QCD, and accommodates baryons (nucleons) which arise as a solitonic
configuration of mesonic fields. Stable configurations are obtained for central
densities $\rho_c/\rho_n\leq 5.0$ where $\rho_n=2.575\times 10^{14}$ g/cc is
the nuclear saturation density. These {\it Skyrmion Stars} are mostly fluid,
with a crust which we describe by the EOS of Baym, Pethick and Sutherland.
Their masses and radii are in the range $0.4 \le M/M_{\odot} \le 3.6$ and $13
{\rm km} \le R \le 23 {\rm km}$, respectively. The minimum spin period is
computed to be between $0.7 {\rm ms}\le P \le 2.1 {\rm ms}$. They appear to
have a mass-radius curve quite different from either neutron or quark stars,
and provide a suitable description of the heavier mass neutron stars discovered
recently due to the inherently stiff EOS. Within the same model, we compute the
dominant neutrino emissivity in neutron-rich $\beta$-equilibrated matter, and
determine the cooling behaviour of Skyrmion stars.",2005-04-04T19:58:51Z
MERLIN monitoring of recent core-collapse supernovae,"The star formation rate (SFR) in starburst galaxies can be measured by many
methods, one of which is through the supernova rate. Due to the heavy dust
obscuration in these galaxies, searches for new supernovae in the optical or
infra-red can easily miss events occurring in the central starburst regions. As
part of a long term program to estimate the SFR in a sample of nearby
starbursts we are using MERLIN and the VLA to regularly observe the galaxies
for new radio supernovae. As part of this project, regular MERLIN observations
have been made of two recent optically bright supernovae: 2004dj and 2004et.
Both supernovae are of Type II and have been monitored frequently over periods
of a few months, resulting in well sampled radio ""light"" curves for both
objects.",2005-05-24T13:00:31Z
"Weibel Instability Driven by Relativistic Pair Jets: Particle
  Acceleration, Magnetic Field Generation, and Emission","Shock acceleration is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical plasmas.
Plasma waves and their associated instabilities (e.g., Buneman, Weibel and
other two-stream instabilities) created in collisionless shocks are responsible
for particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration. Using a 3-D
relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code, we have investigated
particle acceleration associated with a relativistic jet front propagating into
an ambient plasma. We find that the growth times of the Weibel instability in
electron-positron jets are not affected by the (electron-positron or
electron-ion) ambient plasmas. However, the amplitudes of generated local
magnetic fields in the electron-ion ambient plasma are significantly larger
than those in the electron-positron ambient plasma.",2005-03-23T21:41:50Z
"Identification of extragalactic sources of the highest energy EGRET
  photons by correlation analysis","We found significant correlations between the arrival directions of the
highest energy photons (E>10 GeV) observed by EGRET and positions of the BL Lac
type objects (BL Lacs). The observed correlations imply that not less than
three per cent of extragalactic photons at these energies originate from BL
Lacs. Some of the correlating BL Lacs have no counterparts in the EGRET source
catalog, i.e. do not coincide with strong emitters of gamma-rays at lower
energy. The study of correlating BL Lacs suggests that they may form a subset
which is statistically different from the total BL Lac catalog; we argue that
they are prominent candidates for TeV gamma-ray sources. Our results
demonstrate that the analysis of positional correlations is a powerful approach
indispensable in cases when low statistics limits or even prohibits the
standard case-by-case identification.",2005-05-30T12:35:42Z
"The Geometry of and Mass Accretion Rate through the Maser Accretion Disk
  in NGC 4258","A maximum likelihood analysis of the NGC 4258 maser positions and velocities
reveals a ~2 sigma deviation from Keplerian motion in the projected rotation
curve of the high-velocity features, corresponding to a ~9 km/s, or 0.8%,
flattening of the LOS velocities with respect to Keplerian motion over the
range of the high-velocity masers. While there are a number of potential
explanations for this flattening, we argue for pure Keplerian rotation in an
inclination-warped disk based on the ability of this model to explain a number
of otherwise puzzling features of the system. A radial gradient in the disk
inclination of 0.034 mas^{-1} is not only consistent with the observed rotation
curve, but it generates a bowl along the near edge of the disk that naturally
explains the otherwise puzzling narrow spread in the declinations of the
systemic masers. It also explains the existence and location of an apparently
recurring flare amongst the systemic masers. There is no significant evidence
for non-Keplerian rotation in the inclination-warped disk. An additional
implication of the inclination warp is that the disk rises in front of and
obscures the central engine at a disk radius of about 8.3 mas, or 0.29 pc. By
comparing the observed X-ray column to conditions in the disk at this radius,
we argue that the molecular-to-atomic transition occurs just beyond the
outermost maser at 0.28 pc and from this we infer an accretion rate of
\~10^{-4}alpha M_sun/yr, consistent with the jet-dominated accretion models of
Yuan et al. (2002). Our model suggests that most of the observed X-ray column
arises in the warped accretion disk at 0.29 pc, and that the maser emission is
truncated at large radii predominantly as a result of the molecular-to-atomic
phase transition originally proposed by Neufeld & Maloney (1995).",2005-04-19T02:27:25Z
Strong mean field dynamos require supercritical helicity fluxes,"Several one and two dimensional mean field models are analyzed where the
effects of current helicity fluxes and boundaries are included within the
framework of the dynamical quenching model. In contrast to the case with
periodic boundary conditions, the final saturation energy of the mean field
decreases inversely proportional to the magnetic Reynolds number. If a
nondimensional scaling factor in the current helicity flux exceeds a certain
critical value, the dynamo can operate even without kinetic helicity, i.e. it
is based only on shear and current helicity fluxes, as first suggested by
Vishniac & Cho (2001, ApJ 550, 752). Only above this threshold is the current
helicity flux also able to alleviate catastrophic quenching. The fact that
certain turbulence simulations have now shown apparently non-resistively
limited mean field saturation amplitudes may be suggestive of the current
helicity flux having exceeded this critical value. Even below this critical
value the field still reaches appreciable strength at the end of the kinematic
phase, which is in qualitative agreement with dynamos in periodic domains.
However, for large magnetic Reynolds numbers the field undergoes subsequent
variations on a resistive time scale when, for long periods, the field can be
extremely weak.",2005-05-23T19:41:59Z
"High-Resolution Molecular Line Observations of the Environment of the
  Class 0 Source B1-IRS","In this work we present VLA observations of the NH3, CCS, and H2O maser
emission at 1 cm from the star forming region B1-IRS (IRAS 03301+3057) with ~
5"" (=1750 AU) of angular resolution. CCS emission is distributed in three
clumps around the central source. These clumps exhibit a velocity gradient from
red- to blueshifted velocities toward B1-IRS, probably due to an interaction
with the outflow from an embedded protostar. The outflow and its powering
source are traced by a reflection nebula and an associated infrared point
source detected in a 2MASS K-band image. We find that this infrared point
source is associated with water maser emission distributed in an elongated
structure (~ 450 AU size) along the major axis of the reflection nebula and
tracing the base of the outflow of the region. Ammonia emission is extended and
spatially anticorrelated with CCS. This is the first time that this kind of
anticorrelation is observed in a star forming region with such a high angular
resolution, and illustrates the importance of time-dependent chemistry on small
spatial scales. The relatively large abundance of CCS with respect to ammonia,
compared with other star forming regions, suggests an extreme youth for the
B1-IRS object (<10E+5 yr). We suggest the possibility that CCS abundance is
enhanced via shock-induced chemistry.",2005-04-07T10:11:44Z
Large-scale magnetic field of the G8 dwarf xi Bootis A,"We investigate the magnetic geometry of the active G8 dwarf xi Bootis A, from
spectropolarimetric observations obtained in 2003 with the MuSiCoS echelle
spectropolarimeter at the Telescope Bernard Lyot (Observatoire du Pic du Midi,
France). We repeatedly detect a photospheric magnetic field, with periodic
variations consistent with rotational modulation. Circularly polarized (Stokes
V) line profiles present a systematic asymmetry, showing up as an excess in
amplitude and area of the blue lobe of the profiles. A direct modeling of
Stokes V profiles suggests that the global magnetic field is composed of two
main components, with an inclined dipole and a large-scale toroidal field. We
derive a dipole intensity of about 40 G, with an inclination of 35 degrees of
the dipole with respect to the rotation axis. The toroidal field strength is of
order of 120 G. A noticeable evolution of the field geometry is observed over
the 40 nights of our observing window and results in an increase of the field

  This study is the first step of a long-term monitoring of xi Bootis A and
other active solar-type stars, with the aim to investigate secular fluctuations
of stellar magnetic geometries induced by activity cycles.",2005-05-20T13:39:58Z
B335: A Laboratory for Astrochemistry in a Collapsing Cloud,"We present observations of 25 transitions of 17 isotopologues of 9 molecules
toward B335. With a goal of constraining chemical models of collapsing clouds,
we compare our observations, along with data from the literature, to models of
chemical abundances. The observed lines are simulated with a Monte Carlo code,
which uses various physical models of density and velocity as a function of
radius. The dust temperature as a function of radius is calculated
self-consistently by a radiative transfer code. The gas temperature is then
calculated at each radius, including gas-dust collisions, cosmic rays,
photoelectric heating, and molecular cooling. The results provide the input to
the Monte Carlo code. We consider both {\it ad hoc} step function models for
chemical abundances and abundances taken from a self-consistent modeling of the
evolution of a star-forming core. The step function models can match the
observed lines reasonably well, but they require very unlikely combinations of
radial variations in chemical abundances. Among the self-consistent chemical
models, the observed lines are matched best by models with somewhat enhanced
cosmic-ray ionization rates and sulfur abundances. We discuss briefly the steps
needed to close the loop on the modeling of dust and gas, including off-center
spectra of molecular lines.",2005-03-21T21:46:11Z
"Gauge-invariant perturbations at second order: multiple scalar fields on
  large scales","We derive the governing equations for multiple scalar fields minimally
coupled to gravity in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background
spacetime on large scales. We include scalar perturbations up to second order
and write the equations in terms of physically transparent gauge-invariant
variables at first and second order. This allows us to write the perturbed
Klein-Gordon equation at second order solely in terms of the field fluctuations
on flat slices at first and second order.",2005-06-22T17:31:59Z
The Chandra view of extended X-ray emission from Pictor A,"We discuss the extended X-ray emission seen in three archival Chandra
observations, and one archival XMM-Newton observation, of the FRII radio galaxy
Pictor A. The overall properties of the X-ray lobes are consistent with the
conclusions of earlier workers that the extended X-ray emission is largely due
to the inverse-Compton process, and the implied departure from equipartition is
in the range seen by us in other sources. In detail, we show that the
X-ray/radio flux ratio varies quite strongly as a function of position
throughout the source, and we discuss possible implications of this observation
for the spatial variation of electron energy spectra and magnetic field
strength through the lobe. We show that the radio and X-ray properties of the
lobe are not consistent with a simple model in which variations in the magnetic
field strength alone are responsible for the observed differences between
emission at different frequencies. We also discuss the origins of the extended
emission seen around the eastern hotspot, arguing that it may be diffuse
synchrotron radiation tracing a region of distributed particle acceleration,
and the implications of a possible weak X-ray counterjet detection which, taken
together with the other properties of the bright X-ray jet, leads us to suggest
that the X-ray jet and possible counterjet are also produced by synchrotron
emission.",2005-07-29T11:47:27Z
"Probing the outer edge of an accretion disk: A Her X-1 turn-on observed
  with RXTE","We present the analysis of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations of
the turn-on phase of a 35 day cycle of the X-ray binary Her X-1. During the
early phases of the turn-on, the energy spectrum is composed of X-rays
scattered into the line of sight plus heavily absorbed X-rays. The energy
spectra in the 3-17 keV range can be described by a partial covering model,
where one of the components is influenced by photoelectric absorption and
Thomson scattering in cold material plus an iron emission line at 6.5 keV. In
this paper we show the evolution of spectral parameters as well as the
evolution of the pulse profile during the turn-on. We describe this evolution
using Monte Carlo simulations which self-consistently describe the evolution of
the X-ray pulse profile and of the energy spectrum.",2005-07-08T09:11:46Z
"A multiwavlength study of PSR B0628-28: The first overluminous
  rotation-powered pulsar?","The ROSAT source RX J0630.8-2834 was suggested by positional coincidence to
be the X-ray counterpart of the old field pulsar PSR B0628-28. This
association, however, was regarded to be unlikely based on the computed
energetics of the putative X-ray counterpart. In this paper we report on
multiwavelength observations of PSR B0628-28 made with the ESO/NTT observatory
in La Silla, the Jodrell Bank radio observatory and XMM-Newton. Although the
optical observations do not detect any counterpart of RX J0630.8-2834 down to a
limiting magnitude of V=26.1 mag and B=26.3 mag, XMM-Newton observations
finally confirmed it to be the pulsar's X-ray counterpart by detecting X-ray
pulses with the radio pulsar's spin-period. The X-ray pulse profile is
characterized by a single broad peak with a second smaller peak leading the
main pulse component by ~144 degree. The fraction of pulsed photons is (38 +-
7)% with no strong energy dependence in the XMM-Newton bandpass. The pulsar's
X-ray spectrum is well described by a single component power law with photon
index 2.63^{+0.23}_{-0.15}, indicating that the pulsar's X radiation is
dominated by non-thermal emission processes. A low level contribution of
thermal emission from residual cooling or from heated polar caps, cannot be
excluded. The pulsar's spin-down to X-ray energy conversion efficiency is
obtained to be ~16% for the radio dispersion measure inferred pulsar distance.
If confirmed, PSR B0628-28 would be the first X-ray overluminous
rotation-powered pulsar identified among all ~1400 radio pulsars known today.",2005-05-24T13:45:14Z
"Mapping the Kinematics of the Narrow-Line Region in the Seyfert Galaxy
  NGC 4151","Using The Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph HST's
STIS, observations of the OIII emission from the narrow-line region (NLR) of
NGC 4151 were obtained and radial velocities determined. Five orbits of HST
time were used to obtain spectra at five parallel slit configurations, at a
position angle of 58 degrees, with spatial resolution 0.2 arcseconds across and
0.1 arcseconds along each slit. A spectral resolving power of ~ 9,000 with the
G430M grating gave velocity measurements accurate to ~ 34 km/s. A kinematic
model was generated to match the radial velocities, for comparison to previous
kinematic models of biconical radial outflow developed for low-dispersion
spectra at two slit positions. The new high-resolution spectra permit the
measurement of accurate velocity dispersions for each radial-velocity
component. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) reaches a maximum of 1000 km/s
near the nucleus, and generally decreases with increasing distance to about 100
km/s in the extended narrow-line region (ENLR), starting at about 6 arcseconds
from the nucleus. In addition to the bright emission knots, which generally fit
our model, there are faint high velocity clouds which do not fit the biconical
outflow pattern of our kinematic model. These faint clouds occur at the
turnover points of the outflowing bright clouds. We suggest possible scenarios
that could explain these rogue clouds: (1) backflow resulting from shocks and
(2) outflow outside of the bicones, although the latter does not explain how
the knots are ionized and accelerated. A comparison of our observations with a
high-resolution radio map shows that there is no evidence that the kinematics
of the NLR clouds are affected by the radio lobes that comprise the inner jet.",2005-05-05T17:25:34Z
Anti-GZK effect in UHECR spectrum,"In this paper we discuss the anti-GZK effect that arises in the framework of
the diffusive propagation of Ultra High Energy (UHE) protons. This effect
consists in a jump-like increase of the maximum distance from which UHE protons
can reach the observer. The position of the jump is independent of the
Intergalactic Magnetic Field (IMF) strength and depends only on the energy
losses of protons, namely on the transition energy from adiabatic and
pair-production energy losses. The Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR)
spectrum presents a low-energy steepening approximately at this energy, which
is very close to the position of the observed second knee. The dip, seen in the
universal spectrum as a signature of the proton interaction with the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, is also present in the case of diffusive
propagation in magnetic fields.",2005-07-13T15:47:15Z
"Spherical Gravitational Collapse of Annihilating Dark Matter and the
  Minimum Mass of CDM Black Holes","Spherical gravitational collapse of a cold gas of annihilating particles
involves a competition between the free-fall rate $\propto\sqrt{\rho}$ and the
(s-wave) annihilation rate $\propto\rho$. Thus, there is a critical density
$\rhoann$ above which annihilation proceeds faster than free fall.
Gravitational collapse of a cloud of (initial) mass $M$ to a black hole is only
possible if $3/32\pi G^3M^2\lesssim\rhoann$, or $M\gtrsim\Mann\equiv (3/32\pi
G^3\rhoann)^{1/2}$. For a particle mass $m$ and freeze-out temperature
$T_f=m/x_f$, the minimum black hole mass is $\Mann\approx 10^{10}\msun
\times(x_f\sqrt{g_\star}/100\omcdm g_{\star S}m({\rm Gev}))$, where $g_{\star
S}$ and $g_\star$ are degeneracy factors. The formation of a black hole of
initial mass $M_{BH}$ is accompanied by the annihilation of about $M_{ann}$
released in a burst lasting a time $\sim GM_{BH}$ that could reach a total
annihilation luminosity $\sim 10^{59} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. The absence of
astronomical observations of such spectacular events suggests either: (i) the
branching ratio for CDM annihilation to $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs or quarks $\lesssim
10^{-10}$, while the branching ratio to $\nu{\bar{\nu}}$ is $\lesssim 10^{-5}$;
or (ii) CDM is not made of annihilating particles, but may be in some
non-annihilating form, such as axions; or (iii) CDM black holes never form.",2005-05-25T14:14:13Z
"Absorption and scattering properties of arbitrarily shaped particles in
  the Rayleigh domain: A rapid computational method and a theoretical
  foundation for the statistical approach","We provide a theoretical foundation for the statistical approach for
computing the absorption properties of particles in the Rayleigh domain. We
present a general method based on the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to
compute the absorption and scattering properties of particles in the Rayleigh
domain. The method allows to separate the geometrical aspects of a particle
from its material properties. Doing the computation of the optical properties
of a particle once, provides them for any set of refractive indices,
wavelengths and orientations. This allows for fast computations of e.g.
absorption spectra of arbitrarily shaped particles. Other practical
applications of the method are in the interpretation of atmospheric and radar
measurements as well as computations of the scattering matrix of small
particles as a function of the scattering angle. In the statistical approach,
the optical properties of irregularly shaped particles are represented by the
average properties of an ensemble of particles with simple shapes. We show that
the absorption cross section of an ensemble of arbitrarily shaped particles
with arbitrary orientations can always be uniquely represented by the average
absorption cross section of an ensemble of spheroidal particles with the same
composition and fixed orientation. This proves for the first time that the
statistical approach is generally viable in the Rayleigh domain.",2005-04-04T14:19:55Z
511 KeV photons from superconducting cosmic strings,"We show that a tangle of light superconducting strings in the Milky Way could
be the source of the observed 511 KeV emission from electron-positron
annihilation in the Galactic bulge. The scenario predicts a flux that is in
agreement with observations if the strings are at the ~ 1 TeV scale making the
particle physics within reach of planned accelerator experiments. The emission
is directly proportional to the galactic magnetic field and future observations
should be able to differentiate the superconducting string scenario from other
proposals.",2005-05-03T20:00:34Z
"Propagation of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays above $10^{19}$ eV in a
  Structured Extragalactic Magnetic Field and Galactic Magnetic Field","We present numerical simulations on propagation of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic
Rays (UHECRs) above $10^{19}$ eV in a structured extragalactic magnetic field
(EGMF) and simulate their arrival distributions at the earth. We use the IRAS
PSCz catalogue in order to construct a model of the EGMF and source models of
UHECRs, both of which reproduce the local structures observed around the Milky
Way. We also consider modifications of UHECR arrival directions by the galactic
magnetic field. We follow an inverse process of their propagation from the
earth and record the trajectories. This enables us to calculate only
trajectories of UHECRs arriving at the earth, which saves the CPU time. From
these trajectories and our source models, we construct arrival distributions of
UHECRs and calculate the harmonic amplitudes and the two point correlation
functions of them. We estimate number density of sources which reproduces the
Akeno Ground Air Shower Array (AGASA) observation best. As a result, we find
that the most appropriate number density of the sources is $\sim 5 \times
10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This constrains the source candidates of UHECRs. We also
demonstrate skymaps of their arrival distribution with the event number
expected by future experiments and examine how the EGMF affects their arrival
distribution. A main result is diffusion of clustering events which are
obtained from calculations in the absence of the EGMF. This tendency allows us
to reproduce the observed two point correlation function better.",2005-06-09T13:48:08Z
A Chandra X-Ray Survey of Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies,"We present results from Chandra observations of 14 ultraluminous infrared
galaxies (ULIRGs; log(L_IR/L_Sun) >= 12) with redshifts between 0.04 and 0.16.
The goals of the observations were to investigate any correlation between
infrared color or luminosity and the properties of the X-ray emission and to
attempt to determine whether these objects are powered by starbursts or active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). The sample contains approximately the same number of
high and low luminosity objects and ``warm'' and ``cool'' ULIRGs. All 14
galaxies were detected by Chandra. Our analysis shows that the X-ray emission
of the two Seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample are dominated by AGN. The remaining
12 sources are too faint for conventional spectral fitting to be applicable.
Hardness ratios were used to estimate the spectral properties of these faint
sources. The photon indices for our sample plus the Chandra-observed sample
from Ptak et al.(2003) peak in the range of 1.0-1.5, consistent with
expectations for X-ray binaries in a starburst, an absorbed AGN, or hot
bremsstrahlung from a starburst or AGN. The values of photon index for the
objects in our sample classified as Seyferts (type 1 or 2) are larger than 2,
while those classified as HII regions or LINERs tend to be less than 2. The
hard X-ray to far-infrared ratios for the 12 weak sources are similar to those
of starbursts, but we cannot rule out the possibility of absorbed, possibly
Compton-thick, AGNs in some of these objects. Two of these faint sources were
found to have X-ray counterparts to their double optical and infrared nuclei.",2005-08-03T18:14:24Z
"Diffusion coefficient and acceleration spectrum from direct measurements
  of charged cosmic ray nuclei","We discuss the potentials of several experimental configurations dedicated to
direct measurements of charged cosmic ray (CR) nuclei at energies $\gsim$ 100
GeV/n. Within a two-zone propagation model for stable CRs, we calculate light
primary and secondary nuclei fluxes for different diffusion and acceleration
schemes. We show that the new detectors exploiting the long and ultra long
duration balloon flights could determine the diffusion coefficient power index
$\delta$ through the measurement of the boron-to-carbon ratio with an
uncertainty of about 10-15 %, if systematic errors are low enough. Only
space-based or satellite detectors will be able to determine $\delta$ with very
high accuracy even in the case of important systematic errors, thanks to the
higher energy reach and the less severe limitations in the exposure. We show
that no uncertainties other than those on $\delta$ affect the determination of
the acceleration slope $\alpha$, so that measures of light primary nuclei, such
as the carbon one, performed with the same experiments, will provide valuable
information on the acceleration mechanisms.",2005-04-06T12:48:15Z
Iron-Line Emission as a Probe of Bardeen-Petterson Accretion Disks,"In this work we show that Bardeen-Petterson accretion disks can exhibit
unique, detectable features in relativistically broadened emission line
profiles. Some of the unique characteristics include inverted line profiles
with sharper red horns and softer blue horns and even profiles with more than 2
horns from a single rest-frame line. We demonstrate these points by
constructing a series of synthetic line profiles using simple two-component
disk models. We find that the resultant profiles are very sensitive to the two
key parameters one would like to constrain, namely the Bardeen-Petterson
transition radius r_{BP} and the relative tilt \beta between the two disk
components over a range of likely values [10 < r_{BP}/(GM/c^2) < 40 ; 15deg <
\beta < 45deg]. We use our findings to show that some of the ``extra'' line
features observed in the spectrum of the Seyfert-I galaxy MCG--6-30-15 may be
attributable to a Bardeen-Petterson disk structure. Similarly, we apply our
findings to two likely Bardeen-Petterson candidate Galactic black holes - GRO
J1655-40 and XTE J1550-564. We provide synthetic line profiles of these systems
using observationally constrained sets of parameters. Although we do not
formally fit the data for any of these systems, we confirm that our synthetic
spectra are consistent with current observations.",2005-07-12T22:40:08Z
Spiders in Lyot Coronagraphs,"In principle, suppression of on-axis stellar light by a coronagraph is easier
on an unobscured aperture telescope than on one with an obscured aperture.
Recent designs such as the apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph, the `band-limited'
Lyot coronagraph, and several variants of phase mask coronagraphs work best on
unobscured circular aperture telescopes. These designs are developed to enable
the discovery and characterization of nearby jovian or even terrestrial
exoplanets. All of today's major space-based and adaptive optics-equipped
ground based telescopes are obscured aperture systems, with a secondary mirror
held in place by secondary support `spider' vanes. The presence of a secondary
obscuration can be dealt with by ingenious coronagraph designs, but the spider
vanes themselves cause diffracted light that can hamper the search for jovian
exoplanets around nearby stars. We look at the problem of suppressing spider
vane diffraction in Lyot coronagraphs, including apodized pupil and
band-limited designs. We show how spider vane diffraction can be reduced
drastically, and in fact contained, in the final coronagraphic image, within
one resolution element of the geometric image of the focal plane mask's
occulting spot. This makes adaptive optics coronagraphic searches for
exojupiters possible on the next generation of adaptive optics systems being
developed for 8-10 m class telescopes such as Gemini and the Very Large
Telescopes.",2005-06-23T16:01:53Z
The Shape-Alignment relation in $Λ$CDM Cosmic Structures,"In this paper we study the supercluster - cluster morphological properties
using one of the largest ($2\times 512^{3}$ SPH+N-body simulations of large
scale structure formation in a $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the publicly
available code GADGET. We find that filamentary (prolate-like) shapes are the
dominant supercluster and cluster dark matter halo morphological feature, in
agreement with previous studies. However, the baryonic gas component of the
clusters is predominantly spherical. We investigate the alignment between
cluster halos (using either their DM or baryonic components) and their parent
supercluster major-axis orientation, finding that clusters show such a
preferential alignment. Combining the shape and the alignment statistics, we
also find that the amplitude of supercluster - cluster alignment increases
although weakly with supercluster filamentariness.",2005-05-31T11:44:03Z
Modeling a coronal loop heated by MHD-turbulence nanoflares,"We model the hydrodynamic evolution of the plasma confined in a coronal loop,
30000 km long, subject to the heating of nanoflares due to intermittent
magnetic dissipative events in the MHD turbulence produced by loop footpoint
motions. We use the time-dependent distribution of energy dissipation along the
loop obtained from a hybrid shell model, occurring for a magnetic field of
about 10 G in corona; the relevant heating per unit volume along the loop is
used in the Palermo-Harvard loop plasma hydrodynamic model. We describe the
results focussing on the effects produced by the most intense heat pulses,
which lead to loop temperatures between 1 and 1.5 MK.",2005-06-28T11:20:01Z
"Observational Constraints on Accelerating Brane Cosmology with Exchange
  between the Bulk and Brane","We explore observational constraints on a cosmological brane-world scenario
in which the bulk is not empty. Rather, exchange of mass-energy between the
bulk and the bane is allowed. The evolution of matter fields to an observer on
the brane is then modified due to new terms in the energy momentum tensor
describing this exchange. We investigate the constraints from various
cosmological observations on the flow of matter from the bulk into the brane.
Interestingly, we show that it is possible to have a $\Lambda = 0$ cosmology to
an observer in the brane which satisfies standard cosmological constraints
including the CMB temperature fluctuations, Type Ia supernovae at high
redshift, and the matter power spectrum. This model even accounts for the
observed suppression of the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles. In this
cosmology, the observed cosmic acceleration is attributable to the flow of
matter from the bulk to the brane. A peculiar aspect of this cosmology is that
the present dark-matter content of the universe may be significantly larger
than that of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Its influence, however, is offset by the
dark-radiation term. Possible additional observational tests of this new
cosmological paradigm are suggested.",2005-07-09T13:14:09Z
"Radio and X-ray Profiles in Supernova Remnants Undergoing Efficient
  Cosmic Ray Production","The strong shocks in young supernova remnants (SNRs) should accelerate cosmic
rays (CRs) and no doubt exists that \rel electrons are produced in SNRs.
However, direct and convincing evidence that SNRs produce CR nuclei has not yet
been obtained and may, in fact, be long in coming if current gamma-ray
observatories do not see an unambiguous pion-decay feature. Nevertheless, the
lack of an observed pion-decay feature does not necessarily mean that CR ions
are not abundantly produced since ions do not radiate efficiently. If CR ions
are produced efficiently by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), their presence
will modify the hydrodynamics of the SNR and produce morphological effects
which can be clearly seen in radiation produced by electrons. We describe in
some detail our CR-hydro model, which couples DSA with the remnant
hydrodynamics, and the synchrotron emission expected for two distinct parameter
sets representing type Ia and type II supernovae. Several morphological
features emerge in radial profiles, including the forward shock precursor,
which are observable with current X-ray observatories and which should
definitively show if young SNRs produce CR ions efficiently or not. For the
specific case of SN 1006, we conclude, as have others, that the extremely short
X-ray scale heights observed near the outer shock argue convincingly for the
efficient production of CR ions.",2005-07-01T15:39:44Z
"An indirect limit on the amplitude of primordial Gravitational Wave
  Background from CMB-Galaxy Cross Correlation","While large scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies involve a
combination of the scalar and tensor fluctuations, the scalar amplitude can be
independently determined through the CMB-galaxy cross-correlation. Using
recently measured cross-correlation amplitudes, arising from the
cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect in CMB
anisotropies, we obtain a constraint r < 0.5 at 68% confidence level on the
tensor-to-scalar fluctuation amplitude ratio. The data also allow us to exclude
gravity waves at a level of a few percent, relative to the density field, in a
low - Lambda dominated universe(Omega_Lambda~0.5). In future, joining
cross-correlation ISW measurements, which captures cosmological parameter
information, with independent determinations of the matter density and CMB
anisotropy power spectrum, may constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to a level
above 0.05. This value is the ultimate limit on tensor-to-scalar ratio from
temperature anisotropy maps when all other cosmological parameters except for
the tensor amplitude are known and the combination with CMB-galaxy correlation
allows this limit to be reached easily by accounting for degeneracies in
certain cosmological parameters.",2005-04-13T08:26:36Z
"An Asymmetric, Energetic Type Ic Supernova Viewed Off-Axis, and a Link
  to Gamma-Ray Bursts","Type Ic supernovae, the explosions following the core collapse of massive
stars that have previously lost their hydrogen and helium envelopes, are
particularly interesting because of the link with long-duration gamma-ray
bursts. Although indications exist that these explosions are aspherical, direct
evidence has still been missing. Late-time observations of SN 2003jd, a
luminous Type Ic supernova, provide such evidence. Recent Subaru and Keck
spectra reveal double-peaked profiles in the nebular lines of neutral oxygen
and magnesium. These profiles are different from those of known Type Ic
supernovae, with or without a gamma-ray burst, and they can be understood if SN
2003jd was an aspherical, axisymmetric explosion viewed from near the
equatorial plane. If SN 2003jd was associated with a gamma-ray burst, we missed
the burst as it was pointing away from us.",2005-05-10T17:54:08Z
"The Proper Motion of the Magellanic Clouds: The UCAC2-Hipparcos
  Inconsistency","Using the USNO CCD Astrograph all-sky Catalog (UCAC2), we measure the mean
proper motion of the two Magellanic Clouds. Appropriately selected LMC
populations show a proper motion (<\mu RA>, <\mu DEC>) ~ (+0.84,+4.32) that is
significantly higher, in <\mu DEC>, than currently accepted Hipparcos-like
values, <\mu RA>, <\mu DEC> ~ (+1.94,-0.14). A higher <\mu RA> value is also
found for the SMC. Interestingly, the mean UCAC2 LMC proper motion agrees very
well with the only work in the literature (Anguita et al. 2000) pointing to an
unbound Magellanic Clouds-Milky Way interaction. Nonetheless, the implications
of the UCAC2 proper motion are hard to reconcile with our present day
understanding of the Clouds-Galaxy interaction unless one assumes a more
massive Milky Way. Consequently, although no sources of systematic error have
been identified, it is perhaps most likely that the UCAC2 catalog has an as yet
unidentified systematic error resulting in an inconsistency between UCAC2 and
Hipparcos based results for the Magellanic Clouds.",2005-04-18T20:03:17Z
"Chemical Composition of Two H II Regions in NGC 6822 Based on VLT
  Spectroscopy","We present long slit spectrophotometry of regions V and X of the local group
irregular galaxy NGC 6822. The data consist of VLT FORS observations in the
3450 to 7500 A range. We have obtained electron temperatures and densities
using different line intensity ratios. We have derived the He, C, and O
abundances relative to H based on recombination lines, the abundance ratios
among these elements are almost independent of the temperature structure of the
nebulae. We have also determined the N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar abundances based
on collisionally excited lines, the ratios of these abundances relative to that
of H depend strongly on the temperature structure of the nebulae. The chemical
composition of NGC 6822 V is compared with those of the Sun, the Orion nebula,
NGC 346 in the SMC, and 30 Doradus in the LMC. The O/H value derived from
recombination lines is in good agreement with the value derived by Venn et al.
(2001) from two A type supergiants in NGC 6822.",2005-07-04T23:18:44Z
"Chemical Abundances in the Secondary Star of the Neutron Star Binary
  Centaurus X-4","Using a high resolution spectrum of the secondary star in the neutron star
binary {Cen X-4}, we have derived the stellar parameters and veiling caused by
the accretion disk in a consistent way. We have used a $\chi^{2}$ minimization
procedure to explore a grid of 1 500 000 LTE synthetic spectra computed for a
plausible range of both stellar and veiling parameters. Adopting the best model
parameters found, we have determined atmospheric abundances of Fe, Ca, Ti, Ni
and Al. These element abundances are super solar ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=0.23 \pm
0.10$), but only the abundance of Ti and Ni appear to be moderately enhanced
($\ge1\sigma$) as compared with the average values of stars of similar iron
content. These element abundances can be explained if the secondary star
captured a significant amount of matter ejected from a spherically symmetric
supernova explosion of a 4 {$M_\odot$} He core progenitor and assuming solar
abundances as primordial abundances in the secondary star. The kinematic
properties of the system indicate that the neutron star received a natal kick
velocity through an aspherical SN and/or an asymmetric neutrino emission. The
former scenario might be ruled out since our model computations cannot produce
acceptable fits to the observed abundances. We have also examined whether this
system could have formed in the Galactic halo, and our simulations show that
this possibility seems unlikely. We also report a new determination of the Li
abundance consistent with previous studies that is unusually high and close to
the cosmic Li abundance in the Galactic disk.",2005-04-11T18:42:14Z
"The Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) Survey of Galactic HI: Final data
  release of the combined LDS and IAR surveys with improved stray-radiation
  corrections","We present the final data release of observations of lambda 21-cm emission
from Galactic neutral hydrogen over the entire sky, merging the
Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey (LDS: Hartmann & Burton, 1997) of the sky north of
delta = -30 deg with the Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomia Survey (IAR:
Arnal et al., 2000, and Bajaja et al., 2005) of the sky south of delta = -25
deg. The angular resolution of the combined material is HPBW ~ 0.6 deg. The LSR
velocity coverage spans the interval -450 km/s to +400 km/s, at a resolution of
1.3 km/s. The data were corrected for stray radiation at the Institute for
Radioastronomy of the University of Bonn, refining the original correction
applied to the LDS. The rms brightness-temperature noise of the merged database
is 0.07 - 0.09 K. Residual errors in the profile wings due to defects in the
correction for stray radiation are for most of the data below a level of 20 -
40 mK. It would be necessary to construct a telescope with a main beam
efficiency of eta_{MB} > 99% to achieve the same accuracy. The merged and
refined material entering the LAB Survey of Galactic HI is intended to be a
general resource useful to a wide range of studies of the physical and

"Correlation of the estimated arrival time of the relativistic solar ions
  at 1 AU and start of ground level enhancement (GLE)","We are investigated possible correlations between the calculated arrival
times of the first relativistic ions at Earth and GLE start times registered by
surface monitors. The analysis is based on the arrival times and energies of
the first solar ions, registered by the Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) on
board of the ACE satellite, and protons, registered by GOES satellites. We
consider both cases when the interplanetary propagation of the first high
energy ions is essentially scatter-free and the diffusion of high energy ions
during propagation in the interplanetary magnetic field. We extrapolate the
time-velocity and time-rigidity relationships to calculate the expected arrival
times of the relativistic ions that are energetic enough to enter the
atmosphere at the Aragats geographical location and produce secondary fluxes
that reach the monitors.",2005-07-18T18:43:19Z
"Stochastic chemical enrichment in metal-poor systems II. Abundance
  ratios and scatter","A stochastic model of the chemical enrichment of metal-poor systems by
core-collapse supernovae is used to study the scatter in stellar abundance
ratios. The resulting scatter in abundance ratios, e.g. as functions of the
overall metallicity, is demonstrated to be crucially dependent on the as yet
uncertain supernovae yields. The observed abundance ratios and their scatters
therefore have diagnostic power as regards the yields. The relatively small
star-to-star scatter observed in many chemical abundance ratios, e.g. by Cayrel
et al. (2004) for stars down to [Fe/H] = -4, is tentatively explained by the
averaging of a large number of contributing supernovae and by the cosmic
selection effects favoring contributions from supernovae in a certain mass
range for the most metal-poor stars. The scatter in observed abundances of
alpha-elements is understood in terms of observational errors only, while
additional spread in yields or sites of nucleosynthesis may affect the odd-even
elements Na and Al. For the iron-group elements we find systematically too high
predicted Cr/Fe and Cr/Mg ratios, as well as differences between the different
sets of yields, both in terms of predicted abundance ratios and scatter. The
semi-empirical yields recently suggested by Francois et al. (2004) are found to
lead to scatter in abundance ratios significantly greater than observed, when
applied in the inhomogeneous models. ""Spurs"", very narrow sequences in
abundance-ratio diagrams, may disclose a single-supernova origin of the
elements of the stars on the sequence. Verification of the existence of such
features, called single supernova sequences (SSSs), is challenging. This will
require samples of several hundred stars with abundance ratios observed to
accuracies of 0.05 dex or better.",2005-04-27T20:39:05Z
"Chemical Abundances in the Secondary Star of the Neutron Star Binary
  Centaurus X-4","Using a high resolution spectrum of the secondary star in the neutron star
binary {Cen X-4}, we have derived the stellar parameters and veiling caused by
the accretion disk in a consistent way. We have used a $\chi^{2}$ minimization
procedure to explore a grid of 1 500 000 LTE synthetic spectra computed for a
plausible range of both stellar and veiling parameters. Adopting the best model
parameters found, we have determined atmospheric abundances of Fe, Ca, Ti, Ni
and Al. These element abundances are super solar ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=0.23 \pm
0.10$), but only the abundance of Ti and Ni appear to be moderately enhanced
($\ge1\sigma$) as compared with the average values of stars of similar iron
content. These element abundances can be explained if the secondary star
captured a significant amount of matter ejected from a spherically symmetric
supernova explosion of a 4 {$M_\odot$} He core progenitor and assuming solar
abundances as primordial abundances in the secondary star. The kinematic
properties of the system indicate that the neutron star received a natal kick
velocity through an aspherical SN and/or an asymmetric neutrino emission. The
former scenario might be ruled out since our model computations cannot produce
acceptable fits to the observed abundances. We have also examined whether this
system could have formed in the Galactic halo, and our simulations show that
this possibility seems unlikely. We also report a new determination of the Li
abundance consistent with previous studies that is unusually high and close to
the cosmic Li abundance in the Galactic disk.",2005-04-11T18:42:14Z
The zero-crossing scale and the problem of galaxy bias,"One of the main problems in the studies of large scale galaxy structures
concerns the relation of the correlation properties of a certain population of
objects with those of a selected subsample of it, when the selection is
performed by considering physical quantities like luminosity or mass. I
consider the case where the sampling is defined as in the simplest thresholding
selection scheme of the peaks of a Gaussian random field as well as the case of
the extraction of point distributions in high density regions from
gravitational N-body simulations. I show that an invariant scale under sampling
is represented by the zero-crossing scale of \xi(r). By considering recent
measurements in the 2dF and SDSS galaxy surveys I note that the zero-point
crossing length has not yet been clearly identified, while a dependence on the
finite sample size related to the integral constraint is manifest. I show that
this implies that other length scales derived from \xi(r) are also affected by
finite size effects. I discuss the theoretical implications of these results,
when considering the comparison of structures formed in N-body simulations and
observed in galaxy samples, and different tests to study this problem.",2005-07-12T09:58:02Z
The inflationary prediction for primordial non-gaussianity,"We extend the \delta N formalism so that it gives all of the stochastic
properties of the primordial curvature perturbation \zeta if the initial field
perturbations are gaussian. The calculation requires only the knowledge of some
family of unperturbed universes. A formula is given for the normalisation \fnl
of the bispectrum of \zeta, which is the main signal of non-gaussianity.
Examples of the use of the formula are given, and its relation to cosmological
perturbation theory is explained.",2005-04-02T21:44:44Z
The Modelling of InfraRed Dark Clouds,"This paper presents results from modelling 450 micron and 850 micron
continuum and HCO+ line observations of three distinct cores of an infrared
dark cloud (IRDC) directed toward the W51 GMC. In the sub-mm continuum these
cores appear as bright, isolated emission features. One of them coincides with
the peak of 8.3 micron extinction as measured by the Midcourse Space Experiment
satellite. Detailed radiative transfer codes are applied to constrain the
cores' physical conditions to address the key question: Do these IRDC-cores
harbour luminous sources? The results of the continuum model, expressed in the
$\chi^2$ quality-of-fit parameter, are also constrained by the absence of 100
micron emission from IRAS. For the sub-mm emission peaks this shows that
sources of 300 solar luminosities are embedded within the cores. For the
extinction peak, the combination of continuum and HCO+ line modelling indicates
that a heating source is present as well. Furthermore, the line model provides
constraints on the clumpiness of the medium. All three cores have similar
masses of about 70-150 solar masses and similar density structures. The
extinction peak differs from the other two cores by hosting a much weaker
heating source, and the sub-mm emission core at the edge of the IRDC deviates
from the other cores by a higher internal clumpiness.",2005-05-19T13:33:03Z
"Early optical-IR emission from GRB 041219a: neutron-rich internal shocks
  and a mildly magnetized external reverse shock","Very early optical and near infrared (IR) emission was discovered
accompanying the long gamma-ray burst (GRB) 041219a. We show that the
optical/IR flash tracking the gamma-ray lightcurve during the prompt emission
could be understood as emission from neutron-rich internal shocks, as has been
suggested by Fan & Wei. The early K_s-band afterglow lightcurve after the
prompt phase could be well-modeled as the superposition of a reverse shock and
a forward shock component. The radio data also support the reverse shock
interpretation.",2005-04-06T22:36:48Z
"Long-term optical/IR variability of the Be/X-ray binary LS V +44 17/RX
  J0440.9+4431","We present the first long-term study of the optical counterpart to the X-ray
pulsar LS V +44 17/RX J0440.9+4431. The results of our photometric and
spectroscopic analysis show that LS V +44 17/RX J0440.9+4431 contains a
moderately reddened, E(B-V)=0.65+-0.05, B0.2V star located at about 3.3 kpc.
The Ha line consistently shows a double-peak profile varying from symmetric
shape to completely distorted on one side (V/R phases). A correlation between
the equivalent width of the Ha line and the infrared magnitudes is seen: as the
EW(Ha) decreases the IR magnitudes become fainter. This long-term optical/IR
variability is attributed to structural changes in the Be star's circumstellar
disc. The observations include a recent decline in the circumstellar disc and
subsequent recovery. We have witnessed the cessation of a global oscillation
due to the decline of the circumstellar disc. If the present disc growth rate
continues we predict the onset of another episode of V/R variability by the end
of 2006. We have investigated the typical time scales for disc variability of
various Be/X-ray binaries and found a correlation with the orbital period. This
correlation is hard to establish due to the difficulty in defining the exact
duration of the various activity states, but it is seen both in the duration of
the disc growth/dissipation phase and the value of the Ha equivalent width
prior to the appearance of asymmetric profiles. These relationships provide
further evidence for the interaction of the neutron star with the circumstellar
disc of the Be star's companion and confirms the need of a fully developed disc
for the V/R variability to be observed.",2005-06-10T12:16:20Z
"Critical Examinations of QSO Redshift Periodicities and Associations
  with Galaxies in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data","We have used the publicly available data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
and 2dF QSO Redshift Survey to test the hypothesis that QSOs are ejected from
active galaxies with periodic non-cosmological redshifts. For two different
intrinsic redshift models, namely the Karlsson $\log(1+z)$ model and Bell's
decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model, we do two tests respectively. First,
using different criteria, we generate four sets of QSO-galaxy pairs and find
there is no evidence for a periodicity at the predicted frequency in
$\log(1+z)$, or at any other frequency. We then check the relationship between
high redshift QSOs and nearby active galaxies, and we find the distribution of
projected distance between high redshift QSOs and nearby active galaxies and
the distribution of redshifts of those active galaxies are consistent with a
distribution of simulated random pairs, completely different from Bell's
previous conclusion. We also analyze the periodicity in redshifts of QSOs, and
no periodicity is found in high completeness samples, contrary to the DIR
model. These results support that QSOs are not ejected from active galaxies.",2005-06-16T04:13:13Z
Black Holes in Galaxy Mergers: Evolution of Quasars,"Based on numerical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss a model
in which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassive
black holes in galaxies. Nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collision
triggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the duration
of the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas and
dust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and UV
wavelengths. Eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas and
expels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. Between buried and dead
phases there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminous
quasar. Because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution of
obscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of this
phase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposed
luminosity threshold. We determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as a
function of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10
Myr for bright quasars in the optical B-band, in good agreement with empirical
estimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~100 Myr,
naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. However,
observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the IR and hard X-ray bands
as attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. We
obtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which the
quasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agrees
remarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution from
the SDSS for appropriate luminosity thresholds. (Abridged)",2005-04-07T20:00:53Z
"Testing the accuracy of the Hydro-PM approximation in numerical
  simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest","We implement the hydro-PM (HPM) technique (Gnedin & Hui 1998) in the
hydrodynamical simulation code GADGET-II and quantify the differences between
this approximate method and full hydrodynamical simulations of the Lyman-alpha
forest in a concordance LCDM model. At redshifts z=3 and z=4, the differences
between the gas and dark matter (DM) distributions, as measured by the
one-point distribution of density fluctuations, the density power spectrum and
the flux power spectrum, systematically decrease with increasing resolution of
the HPM simulqation. However, reducing these differences to less than a few
percent requires a significantly larger number of grid-cells than particles,
with a correspondingly larger demand for memory. Significant differences in the
flux decrement distribution remain even for very high resolution hydro-PM
simulations, particularly at low redshift. At z=2, the differences between the
flux power spectra obtained from HPM simulations and full hydrodynamical
simulations are generally large and of the order of 20-30 %, and do not
decrease with increasing resolution of the HPM simulation. This is due to the
presence of large amounts of shock-heated gas, a situation which is not
adequately modelled by the HPM approximation. We confirm the results of Gnedin
& Hui (1998) that the statistical properties of the flux distribution are
discrepant by > 5-20 % when compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. The
discrepancies in the flux power spectrum are strongly scale- and
redshift-dependent and extend to large scales. Considerable caution is needed
in attempts to use calibrated HPM simulations for quantitative predictions of
the flux power spectrum and other statistical properties of the Lyman-alpha
forest.",2005-04-28T17:17:18Z
The Draco dwarf galaxy in the near-infrared,"With the William Herschel Telescope in La Palma we made IJKs observations of
an area of about 40'x30' of the Local Group galaxy Draco. This allows us to
describe Draco's late-type stellar population across the whole galaxy at a
photometric level 2 mag deeper than the 2MASS survey. We detected the red giant
branch (RGB) and measured the magnitude of the tip of the RGB in the three
bands. From that in the I band we obtain a distance modulus of
(m-M)_0=19.49+/-0.06(stat)+/-0.15(sys), in excellent agreement with a
measurement from RR Lyrae stars. The peak of the (J-Ks)_0 histogram at
different M_Ks suggests that Draco has a mean [Fe/H]=-1.95+/-1.26 while
fiducial RGB tracks of Galactic globular clusters indicate a mean
[Fe/H]=-1.33+/-0.72 where the error corresponds to the spread around the mean
value. There are significant differences between the colour-magnitude diagrams
of stars in the inner, medium and outer areas of the galaxy. A metal poor
(Z=0.0004) intermediate-age population (about 1.6 Gyr old) is clearly present
and emerges in particular between 6' and 12' from the centre of the galaxy. A
few additional carbon star candidates have been identified from both their
location in the colour-magnitude diagram and from an indication of variability.
The large scale distribution of late-type stars is smooth but irregular in
shape; this points at a variation of inclination with radius.",2005-07-13T17:32:16Z
"Supernova Neutrino-Effects on R-Process Nucleosynthesis in Black Hole
  Formation","Stars with a wide range of masses provide a variety of production sites for
intermediate-to-heavy mass elements. Very massive stars with mass $\geq 8
M_{\odot}$ culminate their evolution by supernova explosions which are presumed
to be the most viable candidate astrophysical sites of r-process
nucleosynthesis. If the models for the supernova r-process are correct, then
nucleosynthesis results could also pose a significant constraint on the remnant
of supernova explosions, $i.e.$ neutron star or black hole. In the case of very
massive core collapse, a remnant stellar black hole is thought to be formed.
Intense neutrino flux from the neutronized core and the neutrino sphere might
suddenly cease during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase because of the black
hole formation. It is interesting to explore observable consequences of such a
neutrino flux truncation. Arguments have recently been given in the literature
that even the neutrino mass may be determined from the time delay of deformed
neutrino energy spectrum after the cease of neutrino ejection (neutrino cutoff
effect). Here, we study the expected theoretical response of the r-process
nucleosynthesis to the neutrino cutoff effect in order to look for another
independent signature of this phenomenon. We found a sensitive response of the
r-process yield if the neutrino cutoff occurs after the critical time when the
expanding materials in the neutrino-driven wind drop out of the Nuclear
Statistical Equilibrium (NSE). The r-process nucleosynthesis yields change
maximally if the cutoff occurs during the r-process. Using this result,
connected with future detection of the time-variation of SN neutrino spectrum,
we are able to identify when the black hole formation occurs in the course of
SN collapse.",2005-06-05T08:25:21Z
Giant Planet Companion to 2MASSW J1207334-393254,"We report new VLT/NACO imaging observations of the young, nearby brown dwarf
2MASSW J1207334-393254 and its suggested planetary mass companion (2M1207 b).
Three epochs of VLT/NACO measurements obtained over nearly one year show that
the planetary mass companion candidate shares the same proper motion and, with
a high confidence level, is not a stationary background object. This result
confirms the status of 2M1207 b as of planetary mass (5 times the mass of
Jupiter) and the first image of a planetary mass companion in a different
system than our own. This discovery offers new perspectives for our
understanding of chemical and physical properties of planetary mass objects as
well as their mechanisms of formation.",2005-04-29T11:23:38Z
Observations of the BL Lac Object 3C 66A with STACEE,"We present the analysis and results of recent high-energy gamma-ray
observations of the BL Lac object 3C 66A conducted with the Solar Tower
Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE). During the 2003-2004
observing season, STACEE extensively observed 3C 66A as part of a
multiwavelength campaign on the source. A total of 33.7 hours of data was taken
on the source, plus an equivalent-duration background observation. After
cleaning the data set a total of 16.3 hours of live time remained, and a net
on-source excess of 1134 events was seen against a background of 231742 events.
At a significance of 2.2 standard deviations this excess is insufficient to
claim a detection of 3C 66A, but is used to establish flux upper limits for the
source.",2005-04-23T03:09:53Z
"High resolution spectroscopy of bright subdwarf B stars - I. Radial
  velocity variables","Radial velocity curves for 15 bright subdwarf B binary systems have been
measured using high precision radial velocity measurements from high S/N
optical high-resolution spectra. In addition, two bright sdB stars are
discovered to be radial velocity variable but the period could not yet be
determined. The companions for all systems are unseen. The periods range from
about 0.18 days up to more than ten days. The radial velocity semi amplitudes
are found to lie between 15 and 130 km/s. Using the mass functions, the masses
of the unseen companions have been constrained to lower limits of 0.03 up to
0.55 M_sun, and most probable values of 0.03 up to 0.81 M_sun. The invisible
companions for three of our program stars are undoubtedly white dwarfs. In the
other cases they could be either white dwarfs or main sequence stars. For two
stars the secondaries could possibly be brown dwarfs. As expected, the orbits
are circular for most of the systems. However, for one third of the program
stars we find slightly eccentric orbits with small eccentricities of
e~0.02-0.06. This is the first time that non-circular orbits have been found in
sdB binaries. No correlation with the orbital period can be found.",2005-07-01T12:43:45Z
"Spurious 'active longitudes' in parametric models of heavily spotted
  eclipsing binaries","In this paper, size distributions of starspots extrapolated from the case of
the Sun, are modelled on the eclipsing binary SV Cam to synthesise images of
stellar photospheres with high spot filling factors. These spot distributions
pepper the primary's surface with spots, many of which are below the resolution
capabilities of eclipse mapping and Doppler imaging techniques. The lightcurves
resulting from these modelled distributions are used to determine the
limitations of image reconstruction from photometric data. Surface brightness
distributions reconstructed from these lightcurves show distinctive spots on
the primary star at its quadrature points. It is concluded that two-spot
modelling or chi-squared minimisation techniques are more susceptible to
spurious structures being generated by systematic errors, arising from
incorrect assumptions about photospheric surface brightness, than simple
Fourier analysis of the light-curves.",2005-04-28T17:32:11Z
Dynamics of a Dust Crystal with Two Different Size Dust Species,"A self-consistent three-dimensional model for a complex (dusty) plasma is
used to study the effects of multiple-sized dust grains in a dust crystal. In
addition to the interparticle forces, which interact through a Yukawa
potential, the model includes the effects of gravity, the variation of the
sheath potential above the powered electrode, and a radial confining potential.
Simulations studied various ratios of a mix of 6.5- and 8.9-micron monodisperse
particles and compared their correlation functions, electric potential energy
of the crystal formations, and the dispersion relations for in-plane and
out-of-plane dust lattice wave (DLW) modes for two different sheath
thicknesses. In the 7 mm sheath, the particles formed two layers in the
vertical direction by size, and acted as a two-layer crystal with weak
correlation between the layers. In the 3 mm sheath, the particles formed an
essentially monolayer crystal; however the crystal dynamics showed some
characteristics of a bilayer crystal.",2005-06-30T22:05:33Z
"Accretion Disks, Jets and Blazar Variability","Although blazar variability is probably dominated by emission from
relativistic jets, accretion disks should be present in all blazars. These
disks produce emission over most of the electromagnetic spectrum; various
unstable processes operate in those disks which lead to variable emission. Here
I summarize some of the most relevant disk mechanisms for AGN variability. I
also discuss some aspects of jet variability, focusing on the possibility that
ultrarelativisitic jets of modest opening angle can reconcile TeV blazar
emission with the many subluminal VLBI knots seen in those sources. Finally, I
present recently illuminated characteristics of optical microvariability of
different classes of AGN which have important implications for the dominant
processes involved.",2005-07-06T17:44:56Z
"The GRB 030329 host: a blue low metallicity subluminous galaxy with
  intense star formation","We present broad band photometry and spectroscopic observations of the host
galaxy of GRB 030329. Analysis of the spectral emission lines shows that the
host is likely a low metallicity galaxy (Z~0.004). The spectral energy
distribution (SED) constructed with the photometric points has been fitted
using synthetic and observational templates. The best SED fit is obtained with
a starburst template with an age of ~150 Myr and an extinction Av~0.6. We find
that the GRB 030329 host galaxy is a subluminous galaxy (L~0.016 L*) with a
stellar mass of >~10^8 Mo. Three independent diagnostics, based on the
restframe UV continuum, the [OII], and the Balmer emission lines, provide a
consistent unextincted star formation rate of ~0.6 Mo yr^-1, implying a high
unextincted specific star formation rate (~34 Mo yr^-1 (L/L*)^-1). We estimate
that the unextincted specific star formation rate of the GRB 030329 host is
higher than ~93.5% of the galaxies at a similar redshift.",2005-07-20T20:09:56Z
Galaxy formation and cosmic-ray acceleration in a magnetized universe,"We study the linear magneto-hydrodynamical behaviour of a Newtonian cosmology
with a viscous magnetized fluid of finite conductivity and generalise the Jeans
instability criterion. The presence of the field favors the anisotropic
collapse of the fluid, which in turn leads to further magnetic amplification
and to an enhanced current-sheet formation in the plane normal to the ambient
magnetic field. When the currents exceed a certain threshold, the resulting
electrostatic turbulence can dramatically amplify the resistivity of the medium
(anomalous resistivity). This could trigger strong electric fields and
subsequently the acceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) during
the formation of protogalactic structures.",2005-06-29T21:31:09Z
"Homeoidally striated density profiles: sequences of virial equilibrium
  configurations with constant anisotropy parameters","The formulation of the tensor virial equations is generalized to unrelaxed
configurations, where virial equilibrium does not coincide with dynamical (or
hydrostatic) equilibrium. Further investigation is devoted to special classes
of homeoidally striated ellipsoids, defined as homeoidally striated, Jacobi
ellipsoids. In particular, virial equilibrium configurations with constant
anisotropy parameters are studied with more detail, including both flattened
and elongated, triaxial configurations, and the determination of the related
bifurcation points. The explicit expression of different rotation parameters is
also determined. An application is made to dark matter haloes hosting giant,
galaxies, with regard to assigned initial and final configuration, following
and generalizing to many respects a procedure conceived by Thuan & Gott (1975).
The dependence of the limiting axis ratios, below which no configuration is
allowed for the sequence under consideration, on the change in mass, total
energy, and angular momentum, during the evolution, is illustrated in some
representative situations. The dependence of axis ratios and rotation
parameters on an additional parameter, related to the initial conditions of the
density perturbation, is analysed in connection with a few special cases.
Within the range of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter, inferred from
high-resolution numerical simulations, the shape of dark matter haloes is
mainly decided by the amount of anisotropy in residual velocity distribution.
On the other hand, the contribution of rotation has only a minor effect on the
meridional plane, and no effect on the equatorial plane, as bifurcation points
occur for larger values of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter. To this respect,
dark matter haloes are found to resemble giant elliptical galaxies.",2005-05-14T10:12:45Z
The Globular Cluster Content of Maffei 1,"Near-infrared images have been used to search for bright globular clusters
near the center of the elliptical galaxy Maffei 1. The number of objects in
various radial intervals from the center of Maffei 1 are compared with the
number density of sources in two control fields, and we find an excess of 31
+/- 11 objects with K between 16.6 and 18.0 in an annulus between 20 and 90
arcsec from the galaxy center. At radii in excess of 90 arcsec the ability to
find clusters is frustrated by statistical noise in the foreground star
population. It is demonstrated that the globular clusters located within 90
arcsec of the center of Maffei 1 span a range of near-infrared colors that are
at least as great as that which is seen among M31 clusters; some of the
clusters appear to have colors that are consistent with them being very young.
The specific globular cluster frequency within 90 arcsec of the center of
Maffei 1 is S_N = 1.3 +/- 0.6 if the distance modulus is 28.1 +/- 0.2 and A_V =
4.7 +/- 0.2. The specific cluster frequency of Maffei 1 is thus similar to that
of other nearby field elliptical galaxies.",2005-04-14T22:32:30Z

"New Low Accretion-Rate Magnetic Binary Systems and their Significance
  for the Evolution of Cataclysmic Variables","Discoveries of two new white dwarf plus M star binaries with striking optical
cyclotron emission features from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) brings to
six the total number of X-ray faint, magnetic accretion binaries that accrete
at rates < 10^{-13} Msun/yr, or <1% of the values normally encountered in
cataclysmic variables. This fact, coupled with donor stars that underfill their
Roche lobes and very cool white dwarfs, brand the binaries as post
common-envelope systems whose orbits have not yet decayed to the point of
Roche-lobe contact. They are pre-magnetic CVs, or pre-Polars. The systems
exhibit spin/orbit synchronism and apparently accrete by efficient capture of
the stellar wind from the secondary star, a process that has been dubbed a
``magnetic siphon''. Because of this, period evolution of the binaries will
occur solely by gravitational radiation, which is very slow for periods >3 hr.
Optical surveys for the cyclotron harmonics appear to be the only means of
discovery, so the space density of pre-Polars could rival that of Polars, and
the binaries provide an important channel of progenitors (in addition to the
asynchronous Intermediate Polars). Both physical and SDSS observational
selection effects are identified that may help to explain the clumping of all
six systems in a narrow range of magnetic field strength around 60 MG.",2005-05-18T17:38:28Z
Dwarf spheroidal galaxies in nearby groups imaged with HST,"An all-sky list of 88 nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies with distances
D < 10 Mpc is considered. Most of the objects have recently been found by
Karachentseva & Karachentsev based on POSSII/ESO-SERC survey. A hundred more
dSph galaxies are expected in this volume, being missed so far because of their
low luminosity and low surface brightness. Apart from 22 dSph members of the
Local Group, there are 33 dSphs in other nearby groups that have been resolved
recently into stars with HST. Only 5% of the local dSphs are situated outside
the known groups. We discuss observational correlation between basic parameters
of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, in particular, absolute magnitude, surface
brightness, metallicity, and so-called ""tidal index"". The observed number of
dSphs in group increases with luminosity of its brightest galaxy. In a
""synthetic"" nearby group, dwarf spheroidal galaxies are distributed in depth
quite symmetrically about the principal galaxy, having an rms distance scatter
of 200 kpc. Projected radial distribution of dSphs in the synthetic group
follows the profile N(R) ~ exp(-R/200 kpc).",2005-04-15T06:49:22Z
Inductive acceleration of UHECRs in sheared relativistic jets,"(Abridged)Relativistic outflows carrying large scale magnetic fields have
large inductive potential and may accelerate protons to ultra high energies. We
discuss a novel scheme of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) acceleration due
to drifts in magnetized, cylindrically collimated, sheared jets of powerful
active galaxies (with jet luminosity $\geq 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$). We point out
that a positively charged particle carried by such a plasma is in an unstable
equilibrium if ${\bf B} \cdot \nabla \times {\bf v}< 0$, so that kinetic drift
along the velocity shear would lead to fast, {\it regular} energy gain. We show
that if a seed of pre-accelerated particles with energy below the ankle $\leq
10^{18}$ eV is present, these particles can be boosted to energies above $
10^{19}$ eV. A key feature of the mechanism is that the highest rigidity
particles are accelerated most efficiently implying the dominance of light
nuclei for energies above the ankle in our model: from a mixed population of
pre-accelerated particle the drift mechanism picks up and boosts protons
preferably. In addition, after a particle traversed large fraction of the
available potential, its Larmor radius becomes of the order of the jet
thickness. In this case, {\it the maximum possible acceleration rate of inverse
relativistic gyro-frequency is achieved} and a particle finally become
unconfined and leave the jet.",2005-07-26T20:00:16Z
An HST Study of the Supernovae Accompanying GRB 040924 and GRB 041006,"We present the results from a {\it Hubble Space Telescope/ACS} study of the
supernovae associated with gamma-ray bursts 040924 ($z=0.86$) and 041006
($z=0.71$). We find evidence that both GRBs were associated with a SN
1998bw-like supernova dimmed by $\sim 1.5$ and $\sim 0.3$ magnitudes,
respectively, making GRB 040924 the faintest GRB-associated SN ever detected.
We study the luminosity dispersion in GRB/XRF-associated SNe and compare to
local Type Ibc supernovae from the literature. We find significant overlap
between the two samples, suggesting that GRB/XRF-associated SNe are not
necessarily more luminous nor produce more $^{56}$Ni than local SNe. Based on
the current (limited) datasets, we find that the two samples may share a
similar $^{56}$Ni production mechanism.",2005-04-15T20:01:07Z
Polarization microvariability of BL Lac objects,"We present the results of a systematic observational campaign designed to
search for microvariability in the optical polarization of BL Lac objects. We
have observed a sample formed by 8 X-ray-selected and 10 radio-selected
sources, looking for rapid changes in both the degree of linear polarization
and the corresponding polarization angle. The whole campaign was carried out
along the last three years, and most of the objects were observed at least on
two consecutive nights. The statistical properties of both classes of BL Lac
objects are compared, and some general conclusions on the nature of the
phenomenon are drawn. In general, radio selected sources seem to display higher
duty cycles for polarimetric microvariability and, on average, they have a
stronger polarization.",2005-06-16T13:19:02Z
"$XMM-Newton$ $Ω$ project: III. Gas mass fraction shape in high
  redshift clusters","We study the gas mass fraction, $f\_{\rm gas},$ behavior in $XMM-Newton$
$\Omega$ project. The typical $f\_{\rm gas}$ shape of high redshift galaxy
clusters follows the global shape inferred at low redshift quite well. This
result is consistent with the gravitational instability picture leading to self
similar structures for both the dark and baryonic matter. However, the mean
$f\_{\rm gas} in distant clusters shows some differences to local ones,
indicating a departure from strict scaling. This result is consistent with the
observed evolution in the luminosity-temperature relation. We quantitatively
investigate this departure from scaling laws. Within the local sample we used,
a moderate but clear variation of the amplitude of the gas mass fraction with
temperature is found, a trend that weakens in the outer regions. These
variations do not explain departure from scaling laws of our distant clusters.
An important implication of our results is that the gas fraction evolution, a
test of the cosmological parameters, can lead to biased values when applied at
radii smaller than the virial radius. From our $XMM$ clusters, the apparent gas
fraction at the virial radius is consistent with a non-evolving universal value
in a high matter density model and not with a concordance.",2005-03-19T10:20:47Z
Estimate of the Mass Composition of Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays,"It is proposed a new approach for estimating the composition of cosmic rays.
It is found that the zenith angle distributions and muon components of EAS for
energies E>10^19 eV and E>4.10^19 eV differ from each other. It is shown that
the cosmic rays above E>4.10^19 eV is heavier than the cosmic rays at energy E~
10^19 eV. According to our estimation the SUGAR array detected 8 showers above
10^20 eV. It is concluded that no sign of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cut off
in the spectrum of cosmic rays and all cosmic rays are galactic.",2005-07-28T22:07:37Z
On water ice formation in interstellar clouds,"A model is proposed for the formation of water ice mantles on grains in
interstellar clouds. This occurs by direct accretion of monomers from the gas,
be they formed by gas or surface reactions. The model predicts the existence of
a threshold in interstellar light extinction, A(v), which is mainly determined
by the adsorption energy of water molecules on the grain material; for
hydrocarbon material, chemical simulation places this energy between 0.5 and 2
kcal/mole, which sets the visible exctinction threshold at a few magnitudes, as
observed. Once the threshold is crossed, all available water molecules in the
gas are quickly adsorbed, forming an ice mantle, because the grain cools down
and the adsorption energy on ice is higher than on bare grain. The model also
predicts that the thickness of the mantle, and, hence, the optical thickness at
3 mu, grow linearly with A(v), as observed, with a slope which depends upon the
total amount of water in the gas. Chemical simulation was also used to
determine the adsorption sites and energies of O and OH on hydrocarbons, and
study the dynamics of formation of water molecules by surface reactions with
gaseous H atoms, as well as their chances of sticking in situ.",2005-07-06T16:32:06Z
"The VLT-UVES survey for molecular hydrogen in high-redshift damped
  Lyman-alpha systems: Physical conditions in the neutral gas","We study the physical conditions in DLAs, using a sample of 33 systems toward
26 QSOs acquired for a recently completed survey of H_2 by Ledoux et al.
(2003). We use the column densities of H_2 in different rotational levels,
together with those of C I, C I*, C I**, C II* and singly ionized atomic
species to discuss the kinetic temperature, the density of hydrogen and the
electronic density in the gas together with the ambient UV radiation field.
Detailed comparisons are made between the observed properties in DLAs, the
interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy, LMC and SMC. The mean kinetic
temperature of the gas corresponding to DLA subcomponents in which H_2
absorption line is detected, derived from the ortho-to-para ratio (153+/-78 K),
is higher than that measured in the ISM (77+/-17 K) and the Magellanic clouds
(82+/-21 K). Typical pressure in these components (corresponding to T = 100-300
K and n = 10-200 cm^-3), measured using C I fine-structure excitation, are
higher than what is measured along ISM sightlines. This is consistent with the
corresponding higher values for N(H_2,J=2)/N(H_2,J=0) seen in DLAs. From the
column densities of the high-J rotational levels, we derive that the typical
radiation field in the H_2 bearing components is of the order of or slightly
higher than the mean UV field in the Galactic ISM. Determination of electron
density in the gas with H_2 and C I show the ionization rate is similar to that
of a cold neutral medium (CNM) in a moderate radiation field. This, together
with the fact that we see H_2 in 13-20% of the DLAs, can be used to conclude
that DLAs at z>1.9 could contribute as much as 50% star formation rate density
seen in Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). (Abridged)",2005-06-23T09:20:11Z
"The History of the Baryon Budget: Cosmic Logistics in a Hierarchical
  Universe","Using a series of high-resolution N-body hydrodynamical numerical
simulations, we investigate several scenarios for the evolution of the baryon
budget in galactic halos. We derive individual halo star formation history
(SFH), as well as the global star formation rate in the universe. We develop a
simple analytical model that allows us to compute surprisingly accurate
predictions, when compared to our simulations, but also to other simulations
presented in Springel & Hernquist (2003). The model depends on two main
parameters: the star formation time scale t* and the wind efficiency eta_w. We
also compute, for halos of a given mass, the baryon fraction in each of the
following phases: cold disc gas, hot halo gas and stars. Here again, our
analytical model predictions are in good agreement with simulation results, if
one correctly takes into account finite resolution effect.
  We compare predictions of our analytical model to several observational
constraints, and conclude that a very narrow range of the model parameters is
allowed. The important role played by galactic winds is outlined, as well as a
possible `superwind' scenario in groups and clusters. The `anti-hierarchical'
behavior of observed SFH is well reproduced by our best model with t*=3Gyr and
eta_w=1.5. We obtain in this case a present-day cosmic baryon budget of Omega*=
0.004, Omega_cold=0.0004, Omega_hot=0.01 and Omega_back=0.02 (diffuse
background).",2005-05-23T14:57:56Z
"First and second-type self-similar solutions of implosions and
  explosions containing ultra-relativistic shocks","We derive self similar solutions for ultra-relativistic shock waves
propagating into cold material of powerlaw density profile in radius rho ~
r^-k. We treat both implosions and explosions in three geometries: planar,
cylindrical and spherical. For spherical explosions these are the first type
solutions of Blandford and McKee for k<4 and the second type solutions found by
Best and Sari for k>5-sqrt(3/4). In addition we find new, hollow (with
evacuated interior), first type solutions that may be applicable for 4<k<17/4.
This ``sequence'' with increasing k of first type solutions, hollow first type
solutions, and then second type solutions is reminiscent of the
non-relativistic sequence. However, while in the non relativistic case there is
a range of k which corresponds to a ``gap'' - a range in $k$ with neither first
nor second type solutions which separates the hollow first type solutions and
the second type solutions, here there is an ``overlap'': a range of k for which
current considerations allow for both hollow first and second type solutions.
Further understanding is needed to determine which of the two solutions apply
in this overlap regime. We provide similar exploration for the other geometries
and for imploding configurations. Interestingly, we find a gap for imploding
spherical shocks and exploding planar shocks and an overlap for imploding
planar solutions. Cylindrical configurations have no hollow solutions and
exhibit direct transition from first type to second type solutions, without a
gap or an overlap region.",2005-05-09T21:02:18Z
On the shape of the UHE cosmic ray spectrum,"We fit the ultra high energy cosmic ray spectra above 10$^{19}$ eV with
different injection spectra at cosmic ray sources that are uniformly and
homogeneously distributed in the Universe. We conclude that the current UHE
spectra are consistent with power laws of index $\alpha$ between 2.4 and 2.7.
There is a slow dependence of these indices on the cosmological evolution of
the cosmic ray sources, which in this model determines the end of the galactic
cosmic rays spectrum.",2005-06-14T19:40:20Z
Discovery of an extended ultraviolet disk in the nearby galaxy NGC4625,"Recent far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observations of the nearby galaxy
NGC4625 made by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) show the presence of an
extended UV disk reaching 4 times the optical radius of the galaxy. The
UV-to-optical colors suggest that the bulk of the stars in the disk of NGC4625
are currently being formed, providing a unique opportunity to study today the
physics of star formation under conditions similar to those when the normal
disks of spiral galaxies like the Milky Way first formed. In the case of
NGC4625, the star formation in the extended disk is likely to be triggered by
interaction with NGC4618 and possibly also with the newly discovered galaxy
NGC4625A. The positions of the FUV complexes in the extended disk coincide with
peaks in the H I distribution. The masses of these complexes are in the range
10^3-10^4 Msun with their Halpha emission (when present) being dominated by
ionization from single stars.",2005-06-15T22:20:06Z
"Helium Recombination Lines as a Probe of Abundance and Temperature
  Problems","The paper presents a simplified formula to determine an electron temperature,
Te(He I), for planetary nebulae (PNe) using the He I 7281/6678 line flux ratio.
In our previous studies of Te(He I) (Zhang et al. 2005), we used the He I line
emission coefficients given by Benjamin et al. (1999). Here we examine the
results of using more recent atomic data presented by Porter et al. (2005). A
good agreement is shown, suggesting that the effect of uncertainties of atomic
data on the resultant Te(He I) is negligible. We also present an analytical
formula to derive electron temperature using the He I discontinuity at 3421 A.
Our analysis shows that Te(He I) values are significantly lower than electron
temperatures deduced from the Balmer jump of H I recombination spectra, Te(H
I), and that inferred from the collisionally excited [O III] nebular-to-auroral
forbidden line flux ratio, Te([O III]). In addition, Te(H I) covers a wider
range of values than either Te(He I) or Te([O III]). This supports the
two-abundance nebular model with hydrogen-deficient material embedded in
diffuse gas of a ``normal'' chemical composition (i.e. ~solar).",2005-06-14T14:24:30Z
"A Wide Field, Low Frequency Radio Image of the Field of M31: II. --
  Source Classification and Discussion","We have previously presented the results of a 325 MHz radio survey of M31,
conducted with the A-configuration of the Very Large Array. In this survey, a
total of 405 radio sources between <6"" and 170"" in extent were mapped with a
resolution of 6"" and a sensitivity of ~0.6 mJy/beam. Here, we compare the
resultant source list and image with other radio, IR, optical, X-ray
observations and catalogs of the region. Through this, we were able to identify
five supernova remnant (SNR) candidates and three pulsar wind nebula (PWN)
candidates in M31, as well as three Milky Way radio stars, a possible Milky Way
Planetary Nebula, and a bevy of interesting extragalactic objects: a BL Lac, a
Giant Radio Galaxy, a galaxy merger, and several high-z radio galaxy
candidates. In addition, a large number of compact (<6"") extremely steep

detected whose nature is unknown.",2005-06-21T13:04:08Z
On the new short orbital period cataclysmic variable Halpha0242-2802,"We present results from our phase-resolved spectroscopy of the newly
identified cataclysmic variable Halpha0242-2802. Halpha0242-2802 was identified
from a deep UK Schmidt Halpha-R band survey as a candidate cataclysmic
variable. Although initial spectroscopy revealed an optical spectrum very
similar to that of the famous short orbital period system WZ Sge, the analysis
of our data shows that this is not the case. Halpha0242-28 differs from WZ Sge
in both the accretion disk structure and the orbital period. In particular,
Halpha0242-28 appears to be a system which has not reached the orbital period
minimum, yet.",2005-06-13T17:57:31Z
Reply to Lyutikov's comments on Zhang & Kobayashi (2005),"Lyutikov (astro-ph/0503505) raised a valid point that for shock deceleration
of a highly magnetized outflow, the fate of the magnetic fields after shock
crossing should be considered. However, his comment that the deceleration
radius should be defined by the total energy rather than by the baryonic
kinetic energy is incorrect. As strictly derived from the shock jump conditions
in Zhang & Kobayashi (2005), during the reverse shock crossing process the
magnetic energy is not tapped. As a result, the fireball deceleration radius is
defined by the baryonic energy only. The magnetic energy is expected to be
transferred to the circumburst medium after the reverse shock disappears. The
evolution of the system then mimicks a continuously-fed fireball. As a result,
Lyutikov's naive conclusion that the forward shock dynamics is independent on
the ejecta content is also incorrect. The shock deceleration dynamics and the
reverse shock calculation presented in Zhang & Kobayashi (2005) are robust and
correct.",2005-04-19T21:12:23Z
"[O II] Emission in Quasar Host Galaxies: Evidence for a Suppressed Star
  Formation Efficiency","The [O II] 3727 line, a commonly used estimator of star formation rate in
extragalactic surveys, should be an equally effective tracer of star formation
in the host galaxies of quasars, whose narrow-line regions are expected to
produce weak low-ionization emission. Quasar spectra generally show little or
no [O II] emission beyond that expected from the active nucleus itself. The
inferred star formation rates in optically selected quasars are typically below
a few solar masses per yr, and some significantly less. Quasars do not appear
to occur coevally with starbursts. Recent observations, on the other hand,
reveal abundant molecular gas in low-redshift quasars. These two results
suggest that the star formation efficiency in quasar host galaxies is somehow
suppressed during the active phase of the nucleus. The low star formation rates
also imply that the nonstellar nucleus powers the bulk of the thermal infrared
emission in radio-quiet quasars.",2005-04-28T17:20:23Z
Mass loss at the lowest stellar masses,"We report the discovery of a jet in a [SII] image of Par-Lup3-4, a remarkable
M5-type pre-main sequence object in the Lupus 3 star-forming cloud. The
spectrum of this star is dominated by the emission lines commonly interpreted
as tracers of accretion and outflows. Par-Lup3-4 is therefore at the very
low-mass end of the exciting sources of jets. High resolution spectroscopy
shows that the [SII] line profile is double-peaked, implying that the low
excitation jet is seen at a small angle (probably larger than 8 degrees) with
respect to the plane of the sky. The width of the H_alpha line suggests a
dominating contribution from the accretion columns and from the shocks on the
stellar surface. Unresolved H_alpha emission coming from an object located at
4.2"" from Par-Lup3-4 is detected at a position angle ~30 degrees or ~210
degrees, with no counterpart seen either in visible or infrared images.We also
confirm previous evidence of strong mass loss from the very low mass star
LS-RCrA 1, with spectral type M6.5 or later. All its forbidden lines are
blueshifted with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) of the molecular
cloud at a position very close to the object and the line profile of the [OI]
lines is clearly asymmetric. Thus, the receding jet could be hidden by a disk
which is not seen edge-on. If an edge-on disk does not surround Par-Lup3-4 or
LS-RCrA 1, an alternative explanation, possibly based on the effects of mass
accretion, is required to account for their unusually low luminosities.",2005-06-14T14:14:04Z
"Mergers of neutron star black hole binaries with small mass ratios:
  nucleosynthesis, gamma-ray bursts and electromagnetic transients","I discuss simulations of the coalescence of black hole neutron star binary
systems with black hole masses between 14 and 20 \msun. The calculations use a
three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, a
temperature-dependent, nuclear equation of state and a multi-flavor neutrino
scheme. General relativistic effects are mimicked using the \Pacz-Wiita
pseudo-potential and gravitational radiation reaction forces. Opposite to
previous, purely Newtonian calculations, in none of the explored cases episodic
mass transfer occurs. The neutron star is always completely disrupted after
most of its mass has been transferred directly into the hole. For black hole
masses between 14 and 16 \Msun an accretion disk forms, large parts of it,
however, are inside the last stable orbit and therefore falling with large
radial velocities into the hole. These disks are (opposite to the neutron star
merger case) thin and -apart from a spiral shock- essentially cold. For higher
mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \ge 18$ \msun) almost the complete neutron star
disappears in the hole without forming an accretion disk. In these cases the
surviving material is spun up by tidal torques and ejected as a half-ring of
neutron-rich matter. None of the investigated systems is a promising GRB
central engine. We find between 0.01 and 0.2 \Msun of the neutron star to be
dynamically ejected. Like in a type Ia supernova, the radioactive decay of this
material will power a light curve with a peak luminosity of a few times
$10^{44}$ erg/s. The maximum will be reached about three days after the
coalescence and will be mainly visible in the optical/near infrared band. The
coalescence itself may produce a precursor pulse with a thermal spectrum of
$\sim 10$ ms duration.",2005-08-04T17:07:54Z
A New Technique for Probing Convection in Pulsating White Dwarf Stars,"In this paper we demonstrate how pulsating white dwarfs can be used as an
astrophysical laboratory for empirically constraining convection in these
stars. We do this using a technique for fitting observed non-sinusoidal light
curves, which allows us to recover the thermal response timescale of the
convection zone (its ""depth"") as well as how this timescale changes as a
function of effective temperature. We also obtain constraints on mode
identifications for the pulsation modes, allowing us to use asteroseismology to
study the interior structure of these stars. Aspects of this approach may have
relevance for other classes of pulsators, including the Cepheids and RR Lyrae
stars.",2005-07-19T18:55:40Z
"An Artificial Neural Network Approach to the Solution of Molecular
  Chemical Equilibrium","A novel approach is presented for the solution of instantaneous chemical
equilibrium problems. The chemical equilibrium can be considered, due to its
intrinsically local character, as a mapping of the three-dimensional parameter
space spanned by the temperature, hydrogen density and electron density into
many one-dimensional spaces representing the number density of each species. We
take advantage of the ability of artificial neural networks to approximate
non-linear functions and construct neural networks for the fast and efficient
solution of the chemical equilibrium problem in typical stellar atmosphere
physical conditions. The neural network approach has the advantage of providing
an analytic function, which can be rapidly evaluated. The networks are trained
with a learning set (that covers the entire parameter space) until a relative
error below 1% is reached. It has been verified that the networks are not
overtrained by using an additional verification set. The networks are then
applied to a snapshot of realistic three-dimensional convection simulations of
the solar atmosphere showing good generalization properties.",2005-05-16T15:59:14Z
Unstable quasi g-modes in rotating main-sequence stars,"This paper studies the oscillatory stability of uniformly rotating
main-sequence stars of mass 3-8 M_sun by solving the linearized non-adiabatic,
non-radial oscillation equations with a forcing term and searching for resonant
response to a complex forcing frequency. By using the traditional approximation
the solution of the forced oscillation equations becomes separable, whereby the
energy equation is made separable by approximation. It is found that the
kappa-mechanism in rotating B-stars can destabilize not only gravity- or
pressure modes, but also a branch of low frequency retrograde (in corotating
frame) oscillations in between the retrograde g-modes and toroidal r-modes.
These unstable quasi g-modes (or `q-modes') hardly exhibit rotational
confinement to the equatorial regions of the star, while the oscillations are
always prograde in the observer's frame, all in contrast to g-modes. The
unstable q-modes occur in a few narrow period bands (defined by their azimuthal
index m), and seem to fit the oscillation spectra observed in SPB stars rather
well. The unstable q-mode oscillation spectrum of a very rapidly rotating 8
M_sun star appears similar to that of the well studied Be-star mu Cen. The
unstable q-modes thus seem far better in explaining the observed oscillation
spectra in SPB-stars and Be-stars than normal g-modes.",2005-06-07T21:18:13Z
Astrophysical bounds on supersymmetric dark-matter Q-balls,"Stable baryonic Q-balls, which appear in supersymmetric extensions of the
Standard Model, could form at the end of cosmological inflation from
fragmentation of the Affleck -- Dine condensate. We reconsider astrophysical
constraints on such Q-balls as dark matter candidates. Baryonic Q-balls
interact with matter by absorbing the baryon number and, effectively, leading
to a rapid baryon number non-conservation. We have recently shown that this
process can occur at a much faster rate than that used in previous
calculations. As a consequence, stability of neutron stars imposes a stringent
constraint on the types of Q-balls that can be dark matter. Only the Q-balls
that correspond to baryonic flat directions lifted by baryon-number violating
operators are allowed as dark-matter candidates.",2005-07-09T00:38:02Z

Evolution of Field Dwarf Galaxies with GEMS,"We present a study of the evolution of late-type field dwarfs over the last ~
1.9 Gyr, based on HST ACS observations carried out as part of the GEMS survey.
This study is amongst the first to probe the evolution of dwarfs over such a
large timescale. The comparison of structural properties, particularly size and
scale length, indicates that the dwarfs in the redshift range z ~ 0.01 to 0.15
(look-back times up to 1.9 Gyr) are more extended than local dwarfs. We argue
that this difference is due to the star formation activity becoming more
centrally concentrated in late-type dwarfs over the last ~ 1.9 Gyr. We discuss
several possible causes for this evolution. We also find a lack of blue compact
dwarfs in the GEMS sample and interpret this as indicative of the fact that
strong, centrally concentrated star formation is a feature of evolved dwarfs
that are entering their final stages of evolution.",2005-05-25T16:23:24Z
Robustness of Discrete Flows and Caustics in Cold Dark Matter Cosmology,"Although a simple argument implies that the distribution of dark matter in
galactic halos is characterized by discrete flows and caustics, their presence
is often ignored in discussions of galactic dynamics and of dark matter
detection strategies. Discrete flows and caustics can in fact be irrelevant if
the number of flows is very large. We estimate the number of dark matter flows
as a function of galactocentric distance and consider the various ways in which
that number can be increased, in particular by the presence of structure on
small scales (dark matter clumps) and the scattering of the flows by
inhomogeneities in the matter distribution. We find that, when all complicating
factors are taken into account, discrete flows and caustics in galactic halos
remain a robust prediction of cold dark matter cosmology with extensive
implications for observation and experiment.",2005-08-01T20:05:44Z
Equation of state for Universe from similarity symmetries,"In this paper we proposed to use the group of analysis of symmetries of the
dynamical system to describe the evolution of the Universe. This methods is
used in searching for the unknown equation of state. It is shown that group of
symmetries enforce the form of the equation of state for noninteracting scaling
multifluids. We showed that symmetries give rise the equation of state in the
form $p=-\Lambda+w_{1}\rho(a)+w_{2}a^{\beta}+0$ and energy density
$\rho=\Lambda+\rho_{01}a^{-3(1+w)}+\rho_{02}a^{\beta}+\rho_{03}a^{-3}$, which
is commonly used in cosmology. The FRW model filled with scaling fluid (called
homological) is confronted with the observations of distant type Ia supernovae.
We found the class of model parameters admissible by the statistical analysis
of SNIa data. We showed that the model with scaling fluid fits well to
supernovae data. We found that $\Omega_{\text{m},0} \simeq 0.4$ and $n \simeq
-1$ ($\beta = -3n$), which can correspond to (hyper) phantom fluid, and to a
high density universe. However if we assume prior that
$\Omega_{\text{m},0}=0.3$ then the favoured model is close to concordance
$\Lambda$CDM model. Our results predict that in the considered model with
scaling fluids distant type Ia supernovae should be brighter than in
$\Lambda$CDM model, while intermediate distant SNIa should be fainter than in
$\Lambda$CDM model. We also investigate whether the model with scaling fluid is
actually preferred by data over $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result we find from
the Akaike model selection criterion prefers the model with noninteracting
scaling fluid.",2005-05-10T16:56:00Z

butterfly-wing-like structures, corresponding to individual clusters, that
encode rich information about the distributions of hot gas and dark matter.
When the cluster redshift and temperature are available the slope of a wing
reveals the cluster gas fraction and the width of the wing indicates how badly
the hot gas traces dark matter. On the basis of simulated data we discuss
systematic errors in the projected gas fraction estimates that would be
obtained from such survey comparisons.",2005-06-02T20:01:24Z
"Evidence for a magnitude-dependent bias in the Hamburg/ESO Survey for
  Damped Lyman-alpha Systems","We present preliminary results from the Hamburg/ESO survey for Damped
Ly-alpha (hereafter, DLA) Systems. This survey is characterized by (i) the good
knowledge of the biases affecting the parent QSO survey, (ii) the brightness
and (iii) the relatively wide magnitude distribution of the background QSOs.
Therefore, it is well-suited to study possible magnitude-dependent biases in
DLA surveys, such as the one expected from dust obscuration. We have
systematically searched for damped Lyman-alpha line candidates in 5 A
resolution spectra of the 188 QSOs that constitute our statistical sample.
These candidates have later been reobserved with UVES at the ESO--Very Large
Telescope (VLT) for confirmation and accurate N(HI) measurements. In the
redshift range covered by the survey, 19 DLA systems have been discovered. Over
the whole survey, we find that the number density, n(z), and cosmological
density of gas, Omega_gas, have comparable values to the ones obtained by
CORALS (Ellison et al. 2001). However, the number densities of DLA systems n(z)
in two sub-samples of equal absorption distance path defined by the magnitude
of the background QSOs differ by a factor of about 5. We estimate that the
probability that n(z) is equal in the two sub-samples is < 0.003. A similar,
only slightly less significant difference is found for Omega_gas.",2005-04-29T10:58:35Z
"The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: Dynamically Close Galaxy Pairs and the
  Global Merger Rate","We derive the number of dynamically close companions per galaxy ($N_c$) and
their total luminosity ($L_c$) for galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue:
$N_c$ is similar to the fraction of galaxies in close pairs and is directly
related to the galaxy merger rate. We find $N_c=0.0174 \pm 0.0015$ and
$L_c=(252 \pm 30) \times 10^6$ $L_{\odot}$ for galaxies with $-22 < M_B -5 \log
h < -19$ with $<z>=0.123$ and $N_c=0.0357 \pm 0.0027$, $L_c= (294 \pm 31)
\times 10^6 L_{\odot}$ for galaxies with $-21 < M_B -5 \log h < -18$, with
$<z>=0.116$. The integrated merger rate to $z=1$ for both samples is about 20
%, but this depends sensitively on the fraction of kinematic pairs that are
truly undergoing a merger (assumed here to be 50%), the evolution of the merger
rate (here as $(1+z)^3$) and the adopted timescale for mergers (0.2 and 0.5 Gyr
for each sample, respectively). Galaxies involved in mergers tend to be
marginally bluer than non-interacting galaxies and show an excess of both
early-type and very late-type objects and a deficiency of intermediate-type
spirals. This suggests that interactions and mergers partly drive the star
formation and morphological evolution of galaxies.",2005-06-27T09:45:33Z
The Detectability of Pair-Production Supernovae at z < 6,"Nonrotating, zero metallicity stars with initial masses 140 < M < 260 solar
masses are expected to end their lives as pair-production supernovae (PPSNe),
in which an electron-positron pair-production instability triggers explosive
nuclear burning. Interest in such stars has been rekindled by recent
theoretical studies that suggest primordial molecular clouds preferentially
form stars with these masses. Since metal enrichment is a local process, the
resulting PPSNe could occur over a broad range of redshifts, in pockets of
metal-free gas. Using the implicit hydrodynamics code KEPLER, we have
calculated a set of PPSN light curves that addresses the theoretical
uncertainties and allows us to assess observational strategies for finding
these objects at intermediate redshifts. The peak luminosities of typical PPSNe
are only slightly greater than those of Type Ia, but they remain bright much
longer (~ 1 year) and have hydrogen lines. Ongoing supernova searches may soon
be able to limit the contribution of these very massive stars to < 1% of the
total star formation rate density out to z=2 which already provides useful
constraints for theoretical models. The planned Joint Dark Energy Mission
satellite will be able to extend these limits out to z=6.",2005-07-08T16:45:55Z
"Captures of Red Giant Stars by Black Holes in Elliptical Galaxies:
  Feedback to the Hot Gas","The highly disturbed hot gas in elliptical galaxies, as revealed in many {\em
Chandra} X-ray images, implies a source of energy in the galactic nucleus. In
some elliptical galaxies faint X-ray ``ghost'' cavities appear without
corresponding radio lobes. It has been suggested that ghost cavities are caused
by short-lived activity with a timescale of $\sim 10^3-10^4$ years, but this is
difficult to understand within the popular paradigm of active galactic nuclei.
We suggest an episode model for ghost cavities, invoking captures of red giant
stars by the black hole located at the center of the elliptical galaxies at a
typical rate of $10^{-5}$yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy. The accretion of tidally
disrupted red giant stars onto the black hole powers activity in a timescale of
a few years. The total energy channeled into the jet/outflow during the cooling
time of the hot gas is $\sim 10^{56}$ erg, which is the typical work required
to form the observed cavities. In this scenario, the faint cavities are
produced by the feedback following accretion of the debris of the captured red
giant stars onto the black holes. We apply the present model to several
elliptical galaxies and find that it can explain the formation of the ghost
cavities. This model can be tested in the future by comparisons between radio
and X-ray observations.",2005-08-01T05:22:16Z
A possible bright blue SN in the afterglow of GRB 020305,"We report on ground-based and HST(+STIS) imaging of the afterglow and host
galaxy of the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) of March 5 2002. The GRB occurred in a
R=25.17+/-0.14 galaxy, which apparently is part of an interacting system. The
lightcurve of the optical afterglow shows a rebrightening, or at least a
plateau, 12--16 days after the gamma-ray event. UBVRIK' multi-band imaging of
the afterglow ~12 days after the GRB reveals a blue spectral energy
distribution (SED). The SED is consistent with a power-law with a spectral
index of \beta=-0.63+/-0.16, but there is tentative evidence for deviations
away from a power-law. Unfortunately, a spectroscopic redshift has not been
secured for GRB020305. From the SED we impose a redshift upper limit of z ~<
2.8, hence excluding the pseudo redshift of 4.6 reported for this burst. We
discuss the possibilities for explaining the lightcurve, SED and host galaxy
properties for GRB 020305. The most natural interpretation of the lightcurve
and the SED is an associated supernova (SN). Our data can not precisely
determine the redshift of the GRB. The most favoured explanation is a low
redshift (z~0.2) SN, but a higher redshift (z>0.5) SN can not be excluded. We
also discuss less likely scenarios not based on SNe, like a burst occurring in
a z=2.5 galaxy with an extinction curve similar to that of the Milky Way.",2005-04-03T07:33:48Z
Can Minor Planets be Used to Assess Gravity in the Outer Solar System?,"The twin Pioneer spacecraft have been tracked for over thirty years as they
headed out of the solar system. After passing 20 AU from the Sun, both
exhibited a systematic error in their trajectories that can be interpreted as a
constant acceleration towards the Sun. This Pioneer Effect is most likely
explained by spacecraft systematics, but there have been no convincing
arguments that that is the case. The alternative is that the Pioneer Effect
represents a real phenomenon and perhaps new physics. What is lacking is a
means of measuring the effect, its variation, its potential anisotropies, and
its region of influence. We show that minor planets provide an observational
vehicle for investigating the gravitational field in the outer solar system,
and that a sustained observation campaign against properly chosen minor planets
could confirm or refute the existence of the Pioneer Effect. Additionally, even
if the Pioneer Effect does not represent a new physical phenomenon, minor
planets can be used to probe the gravitational field in the outer Solar System
and since there are very few intermediate range tests of gravity at the
multiple AU distance scale, this is a worthwhile endeavor in its own right.",2005-04-17T17:04:48Z
Can bars be destroyed by a central mass concentration? I. Simulations,"We study the effect of a central mass concentration (CMC) on the secular
evolution of a barred disc galaxy. Unlike previous studies, we use fully
self-consistent 3D $N$-body simulations with live haloes, which are known to be
important for bar evolution. The CMC is introduced gradually, to avoid
transients. In all cases where the mass of the CMC is of the order of, or more
than, a few per cent of the mass of the disc, the strength of the bar decreases
noticeably. The amount of this decrease depends strongly on the bar type. For
the same CMC, bars with exponential surface-density profile, which formed in a
disk-dominated galaxy (MD-type bars), can be totally destroyed, while strong
bars with a flat surface-density profile, whose evolution is largely due to the
halo (MH-type bars), witness only a decrease of their strength. This decrease
occurs simultaneously from both the innermost and outermost parts of the bar.
The CMC has a stronger effect on the Fourier components of higher azimuthal
wave number $m$, leading to fatter and/or less rectangular bars. Furthermore,
the CMC changes the side-on outline from peanut-shaped to boxy or, for massive
CMCs, to elliptical. Similarly, side-on initially boxy outlines can be
destroyed. The CMC also influences the velocity dispersion profiles. Most of
the decrease of the bar strength occurs while the mass of the CMC increases and
it is accompanied by an increase of the pattern speed. In all our simulations,
the mass of the CMC necessary in order to destroy the bar is at least several
per cent of the mass of the disc. This argues that observed super-massive black
holes are not likely to destroy pre-existing bars.",2005-07-24T15:20:56Z
"Detection of TeV gamma-ray Emission from the Shell-Type Supernova
  Remnant RX J0852.0-4622 with H.E.S.S","We report the detection of TeV gamma-rays from the shell-type supernova
remnant RX J0852.0-4622 with data of 3.2 h of live time recorded with H.E.S.S.
in February 2004. An excess of (700 +/- 60) events from the whole remnant with
a significance of 12 sigma was found. The observed emission region is clearly
extended with a radius of the order of 1 degree and the spatial distribution of
the signal correlates with X-ray observations. The spectrum in the energy range
between 500 GeV and 15 TeV is well described by a power law with a photon index
of 2.1 +/- 0.1(stat) +/- 0.2(syst) and a differential flux at 1 TeV of (2.1 +/-
0.2(stat) +/- 0.6(syst)) 10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1} TeV^{-1}. The integral flux
above 1 TeV was measured to be (1.9 +/- 0.3(stat) +/- 0.6(syst)) 10^{-11}
cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which is at the level of the flux of the Crab nebula at these
energies. More data are needed to draw firm conclusions on the magnetic field
in the remnant and the type of the particle population creating the TeV
gamma-rays.",2005-05-18T14:15:25Z
"Taylor-Couette flow: MRI, SHI and SRI","The linear stability theory of Taylor-Couette flows (unbounded in_z_) is
described including magnetic fields, Hall effect or a density stratification in
order to prepare laboratory experiments to probe the stability of differential
rotation in astrophysics. If an axial field is present then the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) is investigated also for small magnetic
Prandtl numbers. For rotating outer cylinder beyond the Rayleigh line
characteristic minima are found for magnetic Reynolds number of the order of 10
and for Lundquist numbers of order 1. The inclusion of extra toroidal
current-free fields leads to new oscillating solutions with rather low Reynolds
numbers and Hartmann numbers. The Hall effect establishes an unexpected
`shear-Hall instability' (SHI) where shear and magnetic field have opposite
signs. In this case even rotation laws increasing outwards may become unstable.
Recently global solutions have been found for the Taylor-Couette flows with
density stratified in axial directions (`stratorotational instability', SRI).
They exist beyond the Rayleigh line for Froude numbers of moderate order but
also not for too flat rotation laws with \hat\eta^2 < \hat\mu <\hat \eta.",2005-07-13T06:10:07Z
The Dynamics of Radiative Shock Waves: Linear and Nonlinear Evolution,"The stability properties of one-dimensional radiative shocks with a power-law
cooling function of the form $\Lambda \propto \rho^2T^\alpha$ are the main
subject of this work. The linear analysis originally presented by Chevalier &
Imamura, is thoroughfully reviewed for several values of the cooling index
$\alpha$ and higher overtone modes. Consistently with previous results, it is
shown that the spectrum of the linear operator consists in a series of modes
with increasing oscillation frequency. For each mode a critical value of the
cooling index, $\alpha_\textrm{c}$, can be defined so that modes with $\alpha <
\alpha_\textrm{c}$ are unstable, while modes with $\alpha > \alpha_\textrm{c}$
are stable. The perturbative analysis is complemented by several numerical
simulations to follow the time-dependent evolution of the system for different
values of $\alpha$. Particular attention is given to the comparison between
numerical and analytical results (during the early phases of the evolution) and
to the role played by different boundary conditions. It is shown that an
appropriate treatment of the lower boundary yields results that closely follow
the predicted linear behavior. During the nonlinear regime, the shock
oscillations saturate at a finite amplitude and tend to a quasi-periodic cycle.
The modes of oscillations during this phase do not necessarily coincide with
those predicted by linear theory, but may be accounted for by mode-mode
coupling.",2005-05-02T15:16:14Z
Tuning into UHE Neutrinos in Antarctica - The ANITA Experiment,"The Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment is being
developed to search for ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino interactions
($>3\times10^{18}$ eV) in the Antarctic ice cap. A neutrino interaction in the
ice will produce a radio pulse by the means of the Askaryan effect. The large
radio transparency of ice allows for such a pulse to be recorded by a cluster
of balloon-borne antennas. The details of the ANITA instrument, now in a
construction phase, and the science we hope to achieve is discussed. In order
to prepare for the main mission, we have flown ANITA-lite during the 2003/04
austral season. ANITA-lite consisted of two quad-ridge horn antennas and a
prototype RF (radio frequency) triggering and recording system. Here we present
the results of an impulsive RF background survey of Antarctica, as well as
proof-of-principle gain, tracking, and timing calibrations conducted by
observing solar radio emissions and calibration radio-pulses. A preliminary UHE
neutrino flux limit based on ANITA-lite data is also presented.",2005-03-14T21:25:41Z
"Identification of the Red Supergiant Progenitor of Supernova 2005cs: Do
  the Progenitors of Type II-P Supernovae Have Low Mass?","The stars that end their lives as supernovae (SNe) have been directly
observed in only a handful of cases, due mainly to the extreme difficulty in
identifying them in images obtained prior to the SN explosions. Here we report
the identification of the progenitor for the recent Type II-plateau
(core-collapse) SN 2005cs in pre-explosion archival images of the Whirlpool
Galaxy (M51) obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS). From high-quality ground-based images of the SN from the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we precisely determine the position of the SN
and are able to isolate the SN progenitor to within 0"".04 in the HST/ACS
optical images. We further pinpoint the SN location to within 0"".005 from
HST/ACS ultraviolet images of the SN, confirming our progenitor identification.
  From photometry of the SN progenitor obtained with the pre-SN ACS images, and
also limits to its brightness in pre-SN HST/NICMOS images, we infer that the
progenitor is a red supergiant star of spectral type K0--M3, with initial mass
7--9 Msun. We also discuss the implications of the SN 2005cs progenitor
identification and its mass estimate. There is an emerging trend that the most
common Type II-plateau SNe originate from low-mass supergiants 8--15 Msun.",2005-07-18T02:51:43Z
ALMA and Cosmology,"ALMA is a privileged instrument to tackle high redshift galaxies, due to the
negative K-correction in the millimeter domain. Many dusty star-forming
galaxies, invisible in the optical or NIR, will be detected easily through the
peak of their emission in the FIR redshifted in the submm between z=10 and z=5.
Their mass and dynamics will be determined through the CO lines, together with
the efficiency of star formation. Normal intervening galaxies at all z will be
studied through absorption lines in front of quasars, exploring the dense tail
of the column density spectrum. CMB anisotropies could be detected at the
arcsecond scale, the secondary effects (SZ, Vishniak-Ostriker) could test the
re-ionization and the nature of dark energy. The detection of the SZ effect on
a few arcsec scales will allow to map in detail clusters and proto-clusters.",2005-07-16T21:26:14Z
ISO observations and models of galaxies with Hidden Broad Line Regions,"We present ISO mid-infrared spectrophotometry and far-infrared photometry of
galaxies with Hidden Broad Line Regions (HBLR). We also present radiative
transfer models of their spectral energy distributions which enable us to
separate the contributions from the dusty disc of the AGN and the dusty
starbursts. We find that the combination of tapered discs (discs whose
thickness increases with distance from the central source in the inner part but
stays constant in the outer part) and starbursts provide good fits to the data.
The tapered discs dominate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum and the
starbursts in the far-infrared. After correcting the AGN luminosity for
anisotropic emission we find that the ratio of the AGN luminosity to the
starburst luminosity, L(AGN)/L(SB), ranges from about unity for IRAS14454-4343
to about 13 for IRAS01475-0740. Our results suggest that the warm IRAS colours
of HBLR are due to the relatively high L(AGN)/L(SB). Our fits are consistent
with the unified model and the idea that the infrared emission of AGN is
dominated by a dusty disc in the mid-infrared and starbursts in the
far-infrared.",2005-04-20T07:56:11Z
CO in HI Self-Absorbed Clouds in Perseus,"We have observed 12CO J = 2-1 and J = 1-0, and 13CO J = 1-0 emission in two
regions of HI Self-Absorption (HISA) in Perseus: a small, isolated HISA feature
called the globule and a more extended HISA cloud called the complex. Using
both Large Velocity Gradient and Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes we found
that, in the globule, N(12CO) < 6.0x10^15 cm-2 which, using PDR models, implies
that N(H_2) < 9.9x10^20 cm-2. In the complex we found that the H_2 column
densities ranged from 1.2 - 2.2 x 10^21 cm-2. By comparing the HISA and CO
observations we are able to constrain the physical conditions and atomic gas
fraction (f). In the globule, 8 K < T_spin < 22 K and 0.02 < f < 0.2 depending
on whether the (unknown) gas density is 10^2, 10^3, or 10^4 cm-3. In the
complex, 12 K < T_spin < 24 K, 0.02 < f < 0.05, and we were also able to
constrain the gas density (100 < n < 1200 cm-3). These results imply that the
gas in the HISA clouds is colder and denser than that usually associated with
the atomic ISM and, indeed, is similar to that seen in molecular clouds. The
small atomic gas fractions also imply that there is a significant molecular
component in these HISA clouds, even when little or no 12CO is detected. The
level of 12CO detected and the visual extinction due to dust is consistent with
the idea that these HISA clouds are undergoing a transition from the atomic to
molecular phase.",2005-06-27T20:08:24Z
The Swift X-ray Telescope,"The Swift Gamma-Ray Explorer is designed to make prompt multiwavelength
observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and GRB afterglows. The X-ray Telescope
(XRT) enables Swift to determine GRB positions with a few arcseconds accuracy
within 100 seconds of the burst onset.
  The XRT utilizes a mirror set built for JET-X and an XMM/EPIC MOS CCD
detector to provide a sensitive broad-band (0.2-10 keV) X-ray imager with
effective area of > 120 cm^2 at 1.5 keV, field of view of 23.6 x 23.6
arcminutes, and angular resolution of 18 arcseconds (HPD). The detection
sensitivity is 2x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in 10^4 seconds. The instrument is
designed to provide automated source detection and position reporting within 5
seconds of target acquisition. It can also measure the redshifts of GRBs with
Fe line emission or other spectral features. The XRT operates in an
auto-exposure mode, adjusting the CCD readout mode automatically to optimize
the science return for each frame as the source intensity fades. The XRT will
measure spectra and lightcurves of the GRB afterglow beginning about a minute
after the burst and will follow each burst for days or weeks.",2005-08-02T13:25:24Z
TeV Dark Matter detection by Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes,"Ground based Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes have recently unveiled a TeV
gamma-ray signal from the direction of the Galactic Centre. We examine whether
these gamma-rays, observed by the VERITAS, CANGAROO-II and HESS collaborations,
may arise from annihilations of dark matter particles. Emission from nearby
dwarf spheroidals, such as Sagittarius, could provide a test of this scenario.",2005-05-19T17:00:02Z
Very High Energy Cosmic Rays and Their Interactions,"The investigation of high energy cosmic rays and their interactions is a very

Gamma-Ray Emission from Microquasars,"Microquasars, X-ray binary systems that generate relativistic jets, were
discovered in our Galaxy in the last decade of the XXth century. Their name
indicates that they are manifestations of the same physics as quasars but on a
completely different scale. Parallel to this discovery, the EGRET instrument on
board of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory detected 271 point like gamma-ray
sources 170 of which were not clearly identified with known objects. This
marked the beginning of gamma-ray source population studies in the Galaxy. We
present in this thesis models for gamma-ray production in microquasars with the
aim to propose them as possible parent populations for different groups of
EGRET unidentified sources. These models are developed for a variety of
scenarios taking into account several possible combinations, i.e. black holes
or neutron stars as the compact object, low mass or high mass stellar
companions, as well as leptonic or hadronic gamma-ray production processes. We
also show that the presented models for gamma-rays emitting microquasars can be
used to explain observations from well known sources that are detected in
energy ranges other than EGRET's. Finally, we include an alternative gamma-ray
producing situation that does not involve microquasars but a specific
unidentified EGRET source possibly linked to a magnetized accreting pulsar.",2005-04-22T12:56:41Z
"Low-Luminosity AGN as analogues of Galactic Black Holes in the low/hard
  state: Evidence from X-ray timing of NGC 4258","We present a broadband power spectral density function (PSD) measured from
extensive RXTE monitoring data of the low-luminosity AGN NGC 4258, which has an
accurate, maser-determined black hole mass of 3.9+/-0.1 * 10^7 solar masses. We
constrain the PSD break timescale to be greater than 4.5 d at >90% confidence,
which appears to rule out the possibility that NGC 4258 is an analogue of black
hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in the high/soft state. In this sense, the PSD of
NGC 4258 is different to those of some more-luminous Seyferts, which appear
similar to the PSDs of high/soft state X-ray binaries. This result supports
previous analogies between LLAGN and X-ray binaries in the low/hard state based
on spectral energy distributions, indicating that the AGN/BHXRB analogy is
valid across a broad range of accretion rates.",2005-04-06T15:49:10Z
Models for the soft X-ray emission of post-outburst classical novae,"A hydrostatic and stationary white dwarf envelope model has been developed
for the study of the post-outburst phases of classical novae and their soft
X-ray emission. Several white dwarf masses and chemical compositions typical
for classical novae have been considered. The results show that the luminosity,
maximum effective temperature and envelope masses depend on the white dwarf
mass and on the chemical composition. Envelope masses for which equilibrium
solutions exist are pretty small ~10^{-7}-10^{-6} Msun, thus leading to a short
duration of the soft X-ray emitting phase of classical novae, in agreement with
most of the observations. The models presented provide a useful tool for the
determination of the white dwarf properties from observable parameters in the
X-ray range.",2005-04-15T15:44:43Z
Rotational modulation of X-ray emission in Orion Nebula young stars,"We investigate the spatial distribution of X-ray emitting plasma in a sample
of young Orion Nebula Cluster stars by modulation of their X-ray light-curves
due to stellar rotation. The study, part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project
(COUP), is made possible by the exceptional length of the observation: 10 days
of ACIS integration during a time span of 13 days, yielding a total of 1616
detected sources in the 17x17 arcmin field of view. We here focus on a
subsample of 233 X-ray-bright stars with known rotational periods. We search
for X-ray modulation using the Lomb Normalized Periodogram method.
  X-ray modulation related to the rotation period is detected in at least 23
stars with periods between 2 and 12 days and relative amplitudes ranging from
20% to 70%. In 16 cases, the X-ray modulation period is similar to the stellar
rotation period while in seven cases it is about half that value, possibly due
to the presence of X-ray emitting structures at opposite stellar longitudes.
These results constitute the largest sample of low mass stars in which X-ray
rotational modulation has been observed. The detection of rotational modulation
indicates that the X-ray emitting regions are distributed inhomogeneneously in
longitude and do not extend to distances significantly larger than the stellar
radius. Modulation is observed in stars with saturated activity levels
(L_X/L_bol ~ 10^(-3)) showing that saturation is not due to the filling of the
stellar surface with X-ray emitting regions.",2005-06-08T10:27:55Z
"Fully Degenerate Self-Gravitating Fermionic Dark Matter: Implications to
  the Density Profile of the Cluster of Galaxies A1689, and the Mass Hierarchy
  of Black Holes","Equilibrium configurations of weakly interacting fully degenerate fermionic
dark matter are considered at various scales in the Universe. We treat the
general situations for the gravity from Newtonian to general relativity and the
degeneracy from nonrelativistic to relativistic. A dimensionless equilibrium
configuration is specified by a single parameter regardless of particle
properties, the Fermi velocity at the center, and the scalings of mass and
length are specified by the rest mass and statistical weight of the dark matter
particle. We focus our attention to the flat-top nature of the mass column
density profile of the cluster of galaxies, A1689, recently reported by
Broadhurst et al. using gravitational lensing. We convert the column density
profile to a volume density profile assuming spherical symmetry and derive a 3D
encircled mass profile of A1689, which is compared with the model profiles of
degenerate fermion structures. The flat-top profile is reproduced. The
corresponding fermion mass ranges from 2 eV to 30 eV depending on the actual
scale of the degenerate structure. If massive neutrinos are the dominant dark
matter, the rest mass will be about 4.7 or 2.3 eV respectively for Majorana or
Dirac neutrinos. The mass and size of the degenerate structure are
$10^{14}M_\odot$ and 100 kpc for Majorana neutrinos, and
5$\times10^{14}M_\odot$ and 300 kpc for Dirac neutrinos. If we identify the
fermions as heavier sterile neutrinos, they yield the characteristic mass
hierarchy of black holes; giant black hole at the center of a galaxy and the
intermediate mass black holes. Thus we propose the possibility that the mass
hierarchy of fermions determines that of black holes in the Universe.",2005-06-25T10:11:14Z
"Obscured Activity: AGN, Quasars, Starbursts and ULIGs observed by the
  Infrared Space Observatory","Some of the most active galaxies in the Universe are obscured by large
quantities of dust and emit a substantial fraction of their bolometric
luminosity in the infrared. Observations of these infrared luminous galaxies
with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) have provided a relatively unabsorbed
view to the sources fuelling this active emission. The improved sensitivity,
spatial resolution and spectroscopic capability of ISO over its predecessor
Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), has enabled significant advances in the
understanding of the infrared properties of active galaxies. ISO surveyed a
wide range of active galaxies which, in the context of this review, includes
those powered by intense bursts of star-formation as well as those containing a
dominant active galactic nucleus (AGN). Mid infrared imaging resolved for the
first time the dust enshrouded nuclei in many nearby galaxies, while a new era
in infrared spectroscopy was opened by probing a wealth of atomic, ionic and
molecular lines as well as broad band features in the mid and far infrared.
This was particularly useful since it resulted in the understanding of the
power production, excitation and fuelling mechanisms in the nuclei of active
galaxies including the intriguing but so far elusive ultraluminous infrared
galaxies. Detailed studies of various classes of AGN and quasars greatly
improved our understanding of the unification scenario. Far-infrared imaging
and photometry also revealed the presence of a new very cold dust component in
galaxies and furthered our knowledge of the far-infrared properties of faint
starbursts, ULIGs and quasars. We summarise almost nine years of key results

galaxies.",2005-07-07T10:55:34Z
"The Stellar Halo Metallicity - Luminosity Relationship for Spiral
  Galaxies","The stellar halos of spiral galaxies bear important chemo-dynamical
signatures of galaxy formation. We present here the analysis of 89
semi-cosmological spiral galaxy simulations, spanning ~ 4 magnitudes in total
galactic luminosity. These simulations sample a wide variety of merging
histories and show significant dispersion in halo metallicity at a given total
luminosity - more than a factor of ten in metallicity. Our preliminary analysis
suggests that galaxies with a more extended merging history possess halos which
have younger and more metal rich stellar populations than the stellar halos
associated with galaxies with a more abbreviated assembly. A correlation
between halo metallicity and its surface brightness has also been found,
reflecting the correlation between halo metallicity and its stellar mass. Our
simulations are compared with recent Hubble Space Telescope observations of
resolved stellar halos in nearby spirals.",2005-07-12T12:24:02Z
"Galaxies, Intergalactic Absorption Lines, and Feedback at High Redshift","The galaxy-IGM part of the Lyman-break survey currently consists of measured
redshifts for more than 1000 galaxies with redshift 1.5<z<3.5 along the
sightlines to 25 background QSOs. One of the goals of the survey was to measure
the influence on the intergalactic medium of energetic feedback from star and
black-hole formation. This talk begins with a description of the observed
correlations between galaxies and intergalactic absorption lines and ends with
a discussion of whether any of the observations provide clear evidence for
Mpc-scale superwinds. Although our own observations remain fairly ambiguous,
other observations disfavor a very high redshift (z~10) for the creation of
intergalactic metals.",2005-04-14T00:04:50Z
"Mid-Infrared Imaging of Active Galaxies: Active Nuclei and Embedded Star
  Clusters","High resolution, mid-infrared (MIR) images of a set of nine nearby active
galaxies are presented. The data were obtained with the TIMMI2 instrument
mounted at the ESO 3.6m telescope using a set of N-band narrow filters. The
resulting images have an angular resolution of 0.6""-1"". The MIR emission has
been resolved in four galaxies: NGC253, NGC1365, NGC1808 and NGC7469. The
images unveil a circumnuclear population of unknown MIR sources in NGC1365 and
NGC1808, coincident with radio sources. These MIR/radio sources are interpreted
in terms of embedded young star clusters. A high-resolution MIR map of NGC253
is also presented, and enables the identification of a previously unknown MIR
counterpart to the radio nucleus. Extended MIR emission is detected in NGC7469,
and concurs with previous observations in the NIR and radio. For this source,
an interesting morphological difference between the 10.4mic and the 11.9mic
emission is observed, suggesting the presence of a dust-rich micro-bar. Our MIR
images of Circinus do not show resolved emission from the nucleus down to an
angular scale of 0.5"". In the case of NGC2992, an upper limit to the extended
MIR emission can be set. Finally, we provide new MIR flux measurements for the
unresolved AGN in NGC5995, IZw1 and IIZw136.",2005-04-05T16:47:13Z
"The dusty MOCASSIN: fully self-consistent 3D photoionisation and dust
  radiative transfer models","We present the first 3D Monte Carlo (MC) photoionisation code to include a
fully self-consistent treatment of dust radiative transfer (RT) within a
photoionised region. This is the latest development (Version 2.0) of the
gas-only photoionisation code MOCASSIN (Ercolano et al., 2003a), and employs a
stochastic approach to the transport of radiation, allowing both the primary
and secondary components of the radiation field to be treated
self-consistently, whilst accounting for the scattering of radiation by dust
grains mixed with the gas, as well as the absorption and emission of radiation
by both the gas and the dust components. A set of rigorous benchmark tests have
been carried out for dust-only spherically symmetric geometries and 2D disk
configurations. MOCASSIN's results are found to be in agreement with those
obtained by well established dust-only RT codes that employ various approaches
to the solution of the RT problem. A model of the dust and of the photoionised
gas components of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 3918 is also presented as a
means of testing the correct functioning of the RT procedures in a case where
both gas and dust opacities are present. The two components are coupled via the
heating of dust grains by the absorption of both UV continuum photons and
resonance line photons emitted by the gas. The MOCASSIN results show agreement
with those of a 1D dust and gas model of this nebula published previously,
showing the reliability of the new code, which can be applied to a variety of
astrophysical environments.",2005-07-02T09:21:09Z
The Evolution of the M-sigma Relation,"(Abridged) We examine the evolution of the black hole mass - stellar velocity
dispersion (M-sigma) relation over cosmic time using simulations of galaxy
mergers that include feedback from supermassive black hole growth. We consider
mergers of galaxies varying the properties of the progenitors to match those
expected at redshifts z=0-6. We find that the slope of the resulting M-sigma
relation is the same at all redshifts considered. For the same feedback
efficiency that reproduces the observed amplitude of the M-sigma relation at
z=0, there is a weak redshift-dependence to the normalization that results from
an increasing velocity dispersion for a given galactic stellar mass. We develop
a formalism to connect redshift evolution in the M-sigma relation to the
scatter in the local relation at z=0. We show that the scatter in the local
relation places severe constraints on the redshift evolution of both the
normalization and slope of the M-sigma relation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that cosmic downsizing introduces a black hole mass-dependent dispersion in the
M-sigma relation and that the skewness of the distribution about the locally
observed M-sigma relation is sensitive to redshift evolution in the
normalization and slope. In principle, these various diagnostics provide a
method for differentiating between theories for producing the M-sigma relation.
In agreement with existing constraints, our simulations imply that hierarchical
structure formation should produce the relation with small intrinsic scatter.",2005-06-01T22:22:43Z
A New Version of Reimers' law of Mass Loss Based on a Physical Approach,"We present a new semi-empirical relation for the mass loss of cool stellar
winds, which so far has frequently been described by ""Reimers' law"".
Originally, this relation was based solely on dimensional scaling arguments
without any physical interpretation. In our approach, the wind is assumed to
result from the spill-over of the extended chromosphere, possibly associated
with the action of waves, especially Alfven waves, which are used as guidance
in the derivation of the new formula. We obtain a relation akin to the original
Reimers law, but which includes two new factors. They reflect how the
chromospheric height depends on gravity and how the mechanical energy flux
depends, mainly, on effective temperature. The new relation is tested and
sensitively calibrated by modelling the blue end of the Horizontal Branch of
globular clusters. The most significant difference from mass loss rates
predicted by the Reimers relation is an increase by up to a factor of 3 for
luminous late-type (super-)giants, in good agreement with observations.",2005-07-26T11:58:22Z
"Upper Limits on the Extragalactic Background Light from the Gamma-Ray
  Spectra of Blazars","The direct measurement of the extragalactic background light (EBL) is
difficult at optical to infrared wavelengths because of the strong foreground
radiation originating in the Solar System. Very high energy (VHE, E$>$100 GeV)
gamma rays interact with EBL photons of these wavelengths through pair
production. In this work, the available VHE spectra from six blazars are used
to place upper limits on the EBL. These blazars have been detected over a range
of redshifts and a steepening of the spectral index is observed with increasing
source distance. This can be interpreted as absorption by the EBL. In general,
knowledge of the intrinsic source spectrum is necessary to determine the
density of the intervening EBL. Motivated by the observed spectral steepening
with redshift, upper limits on the EBL are derived by assuming that the
intrinsic spectra of the six blazars are $\propto E^{-1.8}$. Upper limits are
then placed on the EBL flux at discrete energies without assuming a specific
spectral shape for the EBL. This is an advantage over other methods since the
EBL spectrum is uncertain.",2005-04-18T19:37:34Z
Magnetic flux captured by an accretion disk,"We suggest a possible mechanism of efficient transport of the large-scale
external magnetic flux inward through a turbulent accretion disk. The outward
drift by turbulent diffusion which limits the effectiveness of this process is
reduced if the external flux passes through the disk in concentrated patches.
Angular momentum loss by a magnetocentrifugal wind from these patches of strong
field adds to the inward drift. We propose that magnetic flux accumulating in
this way at the center of the disk provides the `second parameter' determining
X-ray spectral states of black hole binaries, and the presence of relativistic
outflows.",2005-04-20T04:56:10Z
GRAPE-6A: A single-card GRAPE-6 for parallel PC-GRAPE cluster system,"In this paper, we describe the design and performance of GRAPE-6A, a
special-purpose computer for gravitational many-body simulations. It was
designed to be used with a PC cluster, in which each node has one GRAPE-6A.
Such configuration is particularly effective in running parallel tree
algorithm. Though the use of parallel tree algorithm was possible with the
original GRAPE-6 hardware, it was not very cost-effective since a single
GRAPE-6 board was still too fast and too expensive. Therefore, we designed
GRAPE-6A as a single PCI card to minimize the reproduction cost and optimize
the computing speed. The peak performance is 130 Gflops for one GRAPE-6A board
and 3.1 Tflops for our 24 node cluster. We describe the implementation of the
tree, TreePM and individual timestep algorithms on both a single GRAPE-6A
system and GRAPE-6A cluster. Using the tree algorithm on our 16-node GRAPE-6A
system, we can complete a collisionless simulation with 100 million particles
(8000 steps) within 10 days.",2005-04-19T06:45:13Z
"Kinematics, ages and metallicities for F and G type stars in the solar
  neighbourhood","A new metallicity distribution and an age-metallicity relation are presented
for 437 nearby F and G turn-off and sub-giant stars selected from radial
velocity data of Nidever et al. Photometric metallicities are derived from
uvby-H\beta photometry, and the stellar ages from the isochrones of Bergbusch &
VandenBerg as transformed to $uvby$ photometry using the methods of Clem et al.
The X (stellar-population) criterion of Schuster et al., which combines both
kinematic and metallicity information, provides 22 thick-disk stars.
\sigma_{\rm W} = 32 \pm 5 km s^{-1}, <V_{\rm rot}> = 154 \pm 6 km s^{-1} and
<[M/H]> = -0.55 \pm 0.03 dex for these thick-disk stars, which is in agreement
with values from previous studies of the thick disk. \alpha -element abundances
which are available for some of these thick-disk stars show the typical
alpha-element signatures of the thick disk, supporting the classification
procedure based on the $X$ criteria. Both the scatter in metallicity at a given
age and the presence of old, metal-rich stars in the age-metallicity relation
make it difficult to decide whether or not an age-metallicity relation exists
for the older thin-disk stars. For ages greater than 3 Gyr, our results agree
with the other recent studies that there is almost no correlation between age
and metallicity, \Delta ([M/Fe])/\Delta(age) = -0.01 \pm 0.005 dex Gyr^{-1}.
For the 22 thick-disk stars there is a range in ages of 7-8 Gyr, but again
almost no correlation between age and metallicity.",2005-04-14T09:56:38Z
"Wide-Angle Wind Driven Bipolar Outflows: High Resolution Models with
  Application to Source I of the Becklin-Neugebauer / Kleinmann-Low OMC-I
  Region","We carry out high resolution simulations of the inner regions of a wide angle
wind driven bipolar outflow using an Adaptive Mesh Refinement code. Our code
follows H-He gas with molecular, atomic and ionic components and the associated
time dependent molecular chemistry and ionization dynamics with radiative
cooling. Our simulations explore the nature of the outflow when a spherical
wind expands into a rotating, collapsing envelope. We compare with key
observational properties of the outflow system of Source I in the BN/KL region.
  Our calculations show that the wind evacuates a bipolar outflow cavity in the
infalling envelope. We find the head of the outflow to be unstable and that it
rapidly fragments into clumps. We resolve the dynamics of the strong shear
layer which defines the side walls of the cavity. We conjecture that this layer
is the likely site of maser emission and examine its morphology and rotational
properties. The shell of swept up ambient gas that delineates the cavity edge
retains its angular momentum. This rotation is roughly consistent with that
observed in the Source I SiO maser spots. The observed proper motions and
line-of-sight velocity are approximately reproduced by the model. The cavity
shell at the base of the flow assumes an X-shaped morphology which is also
consistent with Source I. We conclude that the wide opening angle of the
outflow is evidence that a wide-angle wind drives the Source I outflow and not
a collimated jet.",2005-06-08T03:46:47Z
"Anisotropic cosmological models with non-minimally coupled magnetic
  field","Motivated by the structure of one-loop vacuum polarization effects in curved
spacetime we discuss a non-minimal extension of the Einstein-Maxwell equations.
This formalism is applied to Bianchi I models with magnetic field. We obtain
several exact solutions of the non-minimal system including those which
describe an isotropization process. We show that there are inflationary
solutions in which the cosmological constant is determined by the non-minimal
coupling parameters. Furthermore, we find an isotropic de Sitter solution
characterized by a ""screening"" of the magnetic field as a consequence of the
non-minimal coupling.",2005-04-10T10:34:43Z
"Equilibrium Disk-Bulge-Halo Models for the Milky Way and Andromeda
  Galaxies","We describe a new set of self-consistent, equilibrium disk galaxy models that
incorporate an exponential disk, a Hernquist model bulge, an NFW halo and a
central supermassive black hole. The models are derived from explicit
distribution functions for each component and the large number of parameters
permit detailed modeling of actual galaxies. We present techniques that use
structural and kinematic data such as radial surface brightness profiles,
rotation curves and bulge velocity dispersion profiles to find the best-fit
models for the Milky Way and M31. Through N-body realizations of these models
we explore their stability against the formation of bars. The models permit the
study of a wide range of dynamical phenomenon with a high degree of realism.",2005-06-08T19:04:32Z
GRB 050509B: Constraints on short gamma-ray burst models,"We have obtained deep optical images with the Very Large Telescope at ESO of
the first well-localized short-duration gamma-ray burst, GRB 050509B. From V
and R imaging, initiated ~2 days after the GRB trigger and lasting up to three
weeks, we detect no variable object inside the small Swift/XRT X-ray error
circle down to 2sigma limits of V = 26.5 and R = 25.1. The X-ray error circle
includes a giant elliptical galaxy at z = 0.225, which has been proposed as the
likely host of this GRB. Our limits indicate that if the GRB originated at z =
0.225, any supernova-like event accompanying the GRB would have to be over 100
times fainter than normal Type Ia SNe or Type Ic hypernovae, 5 times fainter
than the faintest known Ia or Ic SNe, and fainter than the faintest known Type
II SNe. Moreover, we use the optical limits to constrain the energetics of the
GRB outflow. Simple models indicate that, unless the intrinsic energy in the
outflow from GRB 050509B was << 10^51 erg, there was very little radioactive
material with efficient decay timescales for generating a large luminosity.
These limits strongly constrain progenitor models for this short GRB.",2005-06-06T19:30:37Z
The Aao/Ukst Supercosmos H-alpha Survey (SHS),"The UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) of the Anglo-Australian Observatory completed
a narrow-band H-alpha plus [NII] 6548, 6584A survey of the Southern Galactic
Plane and Magellanic Clouds in late 2003. The survey, which was the last UKST
wide-field photographic survey, and the only one undertaken in a narrow band,
is now an on-line digital data product of the Wide-Field Astronomy Unit of the
Royal Observatory Edinburgh (ROE). The survey utilised a high specification,
monolithic H-alpha interference band-pass filter of exceptional quality. In
conjunction with the fine grained Tech-Pan film as a detector it has produced a
survey with a powerful combination of area coverage (4000 square degrees),
resolution (~1 arcsecond) and sensitivity (<=5 Rayleighs), reaching a depth for
continuum point sources of R~20.5. The main survey consists of 233 individual
fields on a grid of centres separated by 4 degrees at declinations below +2
degrees and covers a swathe approximately 20 degrees wide about the Southern
Galactic Plane. The original survey films were scanned by the SuperCOSMOS
measuring machine at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh to provide the on-line
digital atlas called the SuperCOSMOS H-alpha Survey (SHS). We present the
background to the survey, the key survey characteristics, details and examples
of the data product, calibration process, comparison with other surveys and a
brief description of its potential for scientific exploitation.",2005-06-24T15:06:27Z
Low Luminosity Companions to White Dwarfs,"This paper presents results of a near-infrared imaging survey for low mass
stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs. A wide field proper motion
survey of 261 white dwarfs was capable of directly detecting companions at
orbital separations between $\sim100$ and 5000 AU with masses as low as 0.05
$M_{\odot}$, while a deep near field search of 86 white dwarfs was capable of
directly detecting companions at separations between $\sim50$ and 1100 AU with
masses as low as 0.02 $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, all white dwarf targets were
examined for near-infrared excess emission, a technique capable of detecting
companions at arbitrarily close separations down to masses of 0.05 $M_{\odot}$.
  No brown dwarf candidates were detected, which implies a brown dwarf
companion fraction of $<0.5$% for white dwarfs. In contrast, the stellar
companion fraction of white dwarfs as measured by this survey is 22%,
uncorrected for bias. Moreover, most of the known and suspected stellar
companions to white dwarfs are low mass stars whose masses are only slightly
greater than the masses of brown dwarfs. Twenty previously unknown stellar
companions were detected, five of which are confirmed or likely white dwarfs
themselves, while fifteen are confirmed or likely low mass stars.
  Similar to the distribution of cool field dwarfs as a function of spectral
type, the number of cool unevolved dwarf companions peaks at mid-M type. Based
on the present work, relative to this peak, field L dwarfs appear to be roughly
2-3 times more abundant than companion L dwarfs. Additionally, there is no
evidence that the initial companion masses have been altered by post main
sequence binary interactions.",2005-06-01T13:02:54Z
"The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey: Clustering of Groups and Group
  Galaxies at z~1","We study the clustering properties of groups and of galaxies in groups in the
DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey dataset at z~1. Four clustering measures are
presented: 1) the group correlation function for 460 groups with estimated
velocity dispersions of sigma>200 km/s, 2) the galaxy correlation for the full
galaxy sample, using a flux-limited sample of 9800 objects between 0.7<z<1.0,
3) the galaxy correlation for galaxies in groups, and 4) the group-galaxy
cross-correlation function. Using the observed number density and clustering
amplitude of the groups, the estimated minimum group dark matter halo mass is
M_min~6 10^12 h^-1 M_Sun for a flat LCDM cosmology. Groups are more clustered
than galaxies, with a relative bias of b=1.7 +/-0.04 on scales r_p=0.5-15
Mpc/h. Galaxies in groups are also more clustered than the full galaxy sample,
with a scale-dependent relative bias which falls from b~2.5 +/-0.3 at r_p=0.1
Mpc/h to b~1 +/-0.5 at r_p=10 Mpc/h. The correlation functions for all galaxies
and galaxies in groups can be fit by a power-law on scales r_p=0.05-20 Mpc/h.
We empirically measure the contribution to the projected correlation function
for galaxies in groups from a `one-halo' term and a `two-halo' term by counting
pairs of galaxies in the same or in different groups. The projected
cross-correlation between shows that red galaxies are more centrally
concentrated in groups than blue galaxies at z~1. DEEP2 galaxies in groups
appear to have a shallower radial distribution than that of mock galaxy
catalogs made from N-body simulations, which assume a central galaxy surrounded
by satellite galaxies with an NFW profile. We show that the clustering of
galaxies in groups can be used to place tighter constraints on the halo model
than can be gained from using the usual galaxy correlation function alone.",2005-07-27T20:07:38Z
The conspicuous gamma-ray burst of 30 May 1996,"The spectra of the majority of bursts exhibit a low-energy power law index,
alpha, that is either a constant or becomes softer with time. However, in the
burst of 30 May 1996 alpha becomes harder. Here we show that this behavior can
be explained by a hybrid model consisting of a thermal and a non-thermal
component. In this burst the power-law index of the non-thermal component
changes drastically from s ~ -1.5 to s ~ -0.67 at approximately 5 seconds after
the trigger, thereby revealing, at low energies, the thermal component with its
hard Rayleigh-Jeans tail. This leads to the large alpha-values that are found
if the Band function is fitted to the spectra. We suggest that the change in s
could be due to a transition from fast to slow cooling of the electrons
emitting in the BATSE range. This could be due to the fact that the magnetic
field strength becomes weaker.",2005-04-25T15:12:07Z
"State transition and flaring activity of IGR J17464-3213/H1743-322 with
  SPI/INTEGRAL telescope","IGR J17464-3213, already known as the HEAO-1 transient source H1743-322, has
been detected during a state transition by the SPI/INTEGRAL telescope. We
describe the spectral evolution and flaring activity of IGR
J17464-3213/H1743-322 from 2003 March 21 to 2003 April 22. During the first
part, the source followed a continuous spectral softening, with the peak of the
spectral energy distribution shifting from 100 keV down to a few keV. However
the thermal disk and the hard X-ray components had a similar intensity,
indicating that the source was in an intermediate state throughout our
observations and evolving toward the soft state. In the second part of our
observations, the ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL light curve showed a strong flaring
activity. Two flare events lasting about 1 day each have been detected with SPI
and are probably due to instabilities in the accretion disk associated with the
state transition. During these flares, the low (1.5-12 keV) and high (20-200
keV) energy fluxes monitored with ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL, are correlated and
the spectral shape (above 20 keV) remains unchanged while the luminosity
increases by a factor greater than 2.",2005-05-19T15:05:38Z
Observing Baryon Oscillations with Cosmic Shear,"A cosmic shear survey, spanning a significant proportion of the sky, should
greatly improve constraints on a number of cosmological parameters. It also
provides a unique opportunity to examine the matter power spectrum directly.
However, the observed lensing signal corresponds to a weighted average of the
power spectrum across a range of scales, and so the potential to resolve the
baryon oscillations has been somewhat neglected. These features originated
prior to recombination, induced by the acoustics of the photon-baryon fluid.
Recent galaxy surveys have detected the imprints, and in the future such
measurements may even be used to refine our understanding of dark energy.
Without redshift information, cosmic shear is an ineffective probe of the
baryon oscillations. However, by implementing a novel multipole-dependent
selection of photometric redshift bins, sensitivity is improved by an order of
magnitude, bringing the ""wiggles"" within reach of future surveys. As an
illustration, we show that data from surveys scheduled within the next ten
years will be able to distinguish a smoothed power spectrum at the two sigma
level.",2005-07-13T17:36:13Z
Primordial Black Holes - Recent Developments,"Recent developments in the study of primordial black holes (PBHs) will be
reviewed, with particular emphasis on their formation and evaporation. PBHs
could provide a unique probe of the early Universe, gravitational collapse,
high energy physics and quantum gravity. Indeed their study may place
interesting constraints on the physics relevant to these areas even if they
never formed. In the ""early Universe"" context, particularly useful constraints
can be placed on inflationary scenarios, especially if evaporating PBHs leave
stable Planck-mass relicts. In the ""gravitational collapse"" context, the
existence of PBHs could provide a unique test of the sort of critical phenomena
discovered in recent numerical calculations. In the ""high energy physics""
context, information may come from gamma-ray bursts (if a subset of these are
generated by PBH explosions) or from cosmic rays (if some of these derive from
evaporating PBHs). In the ""quantum gravity"" context, the formation and
evaporation of small black holes could lead to observable signatures in cosmic
ray events and accelerator experiments, providing there are extra dimensions
and providing the quantum gravity scale is around a TeV.",2005-04-01T19:34:37Z
"Precision of Inflaton Potential Reconstruction from CMB Using the
  General Slow-Roll Approximation","Through a principal component analysis, we study how accurately CMB
observables can constrain inflaton potentials in a model independent manner. We
apply the general slow-roll approximation in our analysis where we allow, in
contrast to the standard slow-roll approximation, the possibility of variations
in $V''(\phi)$ and take into account the fact that horizon crossing is not an
instantaneous event. Our analysis provides a set of modes to be used in fitting
observables. We find that of order five of these modes will be constrained by
future observations, so a fully general data analysis package could use the
amplitudes of just a handful of modes as free parameters and retain all
relevant information in the data.",2005-05-09T02:42:43Z
Properties of FIRBACK-ELAIS 175 um sources in the ELAIS N2 region,"We report on a search for the optical counterparts of 175 um - selected

comparison of their observed spectral energy distributions with predictions
from radiative transfer models which simulate the emission from both cirrus and
starburst components. We find the far-infrared sources to be 80 per cent star
bursting galaxies with their starburst component at a high optical depth. The
resulting SEDs were used to estimate far-infrared luminosities, star formation
rates, dust temperatures and dust masses. The N2 FIRBACK population is found to

Swift observations of GRB050128: the early X-ray afterglow,"Swift discovered GRB050128 with the Burst Alert Telescope and promptly
pointed its narrow field instruments to monitor the afterglow. X-ray
observations started 108 s after the trigger time. The early decay of the
afterglow is relatively flat with a temporal decay modeled with a power law
with index ~ -0.3. A steepening occurs at later times (~ 1500 s) with a power
law index of ~ -1.3. During this transition, the observed X-ray spectrum does
not change. We interpret this behaviour as either an early jet break or
evidence for a transition from the fast cooling regime to the slow cooling
regime in a wind environment.",2005-04-14T15:53:48Z
"The Stellar Content of Nearby Star-Forming Galaxies. III. Unravelling
  the Nature of the Diffuse Ultraviolet Light","We investigate the nature of the diffuse intra-cluster ultraviolet light seen
in twelve local starburst galaxies, using long-slit ultraviolet spectroscopy
obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST). We take this faint intra-cluster light to be the field
in each galaxy, and compare its spectroscopic signature with STARBURST99
evolutionary synthesis models and with neighboring star clusters. Our main
result is that the diffuse ultraviolet light in eleven of the twelve starbursts
lacks the strong O-star wind features that are clearly visible in spectra of
luminous clusters in the same galaxies. The difference in stellar features
dominating cluster and field spectra indicate that the field light originates
primarily from a different stellar population, and not from scattering of UV
photons leaking out of the massive clusters. We consider several scenarios to
understand the lack of observed O stars in the field, and their implications
for the origin of the field stellar population. If the field stellar
populations formed in situ, the field must either have an IMF which is steeper
than Salpeter (3.0-3.5) or a Salpeter slope with an upper mass cutoff of 30-50
solar masses. If star formation occurs primarily in star clusters, the field
could be composed of older, faded clusters, and/or a population which is coeval
with the luminous clusters but lower in mass. If the field is composed of
older, dissolving clusters, we estimate that star clusters (regardless of mass)
need to dissolve on timescales 7-10 Myr to create the field (abridged).",2005-05-02T14:13:45Z
Astrophysical Unipolar Inductors Powered by Gravitational Wave Emission,"We consider the Unipolar Inductor Model (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1969)
applied to Double Degenerate Binaries (DDBs) with ultrashort periods (Wu et al.
2002). In this model a magnetized primary white dwarf has a slight asynchronism
between its spin and orbital motion, so that the (non-magnetic) secondary
experiences a motional electric field when moving through the primary field
lines. This induces a current flow between the two stars and provides an
electric spin-orbit coupling mechanism for the primary. We study the combined
effect of Gravitational Wave emission and electric spin-orbit coupling on the
evolution of the primary degree of asynchronism and the associated rate of
electric current dissipation in such systems, assuming that the primary's spin
is not affected by any other mechanisms. In particular, we show that in
ultrashort period binaries the emission of GW pumps energy in the electric
circuit as to keep it steadily active. This happens despite the fact that
spin-orbit coupling can rapidly synchronize the primary, because GW represent a
slow desynchronizing mechanism steadily substracting orbital angular momentum
to the system. A slightly asynchronous steady-state is thus achieved,
determined by the balance between these two competing effects. This can be
shown to correspond to a condition where the total available electric energy is
conserved, because of GW emission, while dissipation, synchronization and
orbital shrinking continue.",2005-07-20T11:38:48Z
"On the viability of neutron star black hole binaries as central engines
  of gamma-ray bursts","I discuss three-dimensional SPH simulations of neutron star black hole
encounters. The calculations are performed using a nuclear equation of state
and a multi-flavor neutrino treatment, general relativistic effects are
mimicked using the Paczynski-Wiita pseudo-potential and gravitational radiation
reaction forces. Most of the explored mass range (14 to 20 \msun) has not been
considered before in numerical simulations. The neutron star is always
disrupted during the first approach after most of its mass has been transferred
directly into the hole. In none of the analyzed cases episodic mass transfer is
found. If an accretion disk forms at all, it is relatively cold ($T < 2.5$
MeV), of only moderate density ($\rho \sim 10^{10}$ g/ccm) and substantially
consumed by the hole on the simulation time scale of a few milliseconds. None
of the investigated systems of this study yields conditions that are promising
to launch a GRB. While we cannot completely exclude that a subset of neutron
star black hole binaries, maybe black holes with low masses and very large
initial spins, can produce a GRB, this seems to happen -if at all- only in a
restricted region of the available parameter space. I argue that the difficulty
to form promising disks together with the absence of any observed neutron star
black hole binary may mean that they are insignificant as central engines of
the observed, short-hard GRBs and that the vast majority of the latter ones is
caused by double neutron star coalescences.",2005-04-30T14:42:40Z
"The Rise of Dwarfs and the Fall of Giants: Galaxy Formation Feedback
  Signatures in the Halo Satellite Luminosity Function","The observed luminosity function (LF) of satellite galaxies shows several
interesting features that require a better understanding of gas-thermodynamic
processes and feedback effects related to reionization and galaxy formation. In
galaxy clusters, the abundance of dwarf galaxies is in good agreement with the
expectation based on the subhalo mass function, whereas in galaxy groups, the
relatively small abundance of dwarfs conflicts with theoretical expectations.
In all halo systems, there is a dip in the abundance of galaxies with
luminosities in the range ~ 2x10^8 L_sun to 10^10 L_sun, corresponding to
subhalo mass scales between ~ 5x10^10 M_sun to few times 10^11 M_sun.
Photoionization from reionization has been used to explain statistics of the
dwarf population, with larger systems forming prior to, and smaller systems
forming subsequent to, reionization. The observed dip in the LF is an imprint
of small dwarf galaxies (<2x10^8 L_sun) that formed prior to reionization. The
galactic winds powered by supernovae in these dwarf galaxies propagate energy
and metals to large distances such that the intergalactic medium is uniformly
enriched to a level of 10^-3 zsun, as observed in the low-redshift Ly-alpha
forest. The associated energy related to this metallicity raises the
intergalactic medium temperature and the Jeans mass to a range 10^10-10^11
M_sun at z ~ 3.4-6.0. Because the epoch of nonlinearity for halos in this mass
range is at z > 3.4-4.4, their gas content, hence star formation, is greatly
suppressed on average and leads to a dip in the observed LF at $z=0$. Larger
halos (M > 10^11 M_sun), becoming nonlinear at z < 3.4-4.4, have masses topping
the Jeans mass, where subhalo mass function based LF is again in agreement with
observations.",2005-06-19T05:48:24Z
High-Mass Cloud Cores in the eta Carinae Giant Molecular Cloud,"We carried out an unbiased survey for massive dense cores in the giant
molecular cloud associated with eta Carinae with the NANTEN telescope in 12CO,
13CO, and C18O 1-0 emission lines. We identified 15 C18O cores. Two of the 15
cores are associated with IRAS point sources whose luminosities are larger than
10^4 Lo, which indicates that massive star formation is occuring within these
cores. Five cores including the two with IRAS sources are associated with MSX
point sources. We detected H13CO+ (1-0) emission toward 4 C18O cores, one of
which is associated with neither IRAS nor MSX point sources. This core shows
the presence of a bipolar molecular outflow in 12CO (2-1), which indicates that
star formation is also occuring in the core. In total, six C18O cores out of 15
are experienced star formation, and at least 2 of 15 are massive-star forming
cores in the eta Car GMC. We found that massive star formation occurs
preferentially in cores with larger column density, mass, number density, and
smaller ratio of virial mass to LTE mass Mvir/M. We also found that the cores
in the eta Car GMC are characterized by large line width and Mvir/M on average
compared to the cores in other GMCs. We investigated the origin of a large
amount of turbulence in the eta Car GMC. We propose the possibility that the
large turbulence was pre-existing when the GMC was formed, and is now
dissipating. Mechanisms such as multiple supernova explosions in the Carina
flare supershell may have contributed to form a GMC with a large amount of
turbulence.",2005-08-04T05:09:30Z
High-resolution observations of SN 2001gd in NGC 5033,"We report on 8.4 GHz VLBI observations of SN2001gd in the spiral galaxy
NGC5033 made on 26 June 2002 and 8 April 2003. Our data nominally suggests a
relatively strong deceleration for the expansion of SN2001gd, but we cannot
dismiss the possibility of a free supernova expansion. From our VLBI
observations on 8 April 2003, we inferred a minimum total energy in
relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the supernova shell of E_min
=(0.3-14) 10^{47} ergs, and a corresponding equipartition average magnetic
field of B_min = (50--350) mG. We also present multiwavelength VLA measurements
of SN2001gd, which are well fit by an optically thin, synchrotron spectrum,
partially absorbed by thermal plasma. We obtain a supernova flux density of
(1.02 +/- 0.05) mJy at the observing frequency of 8.4 GHz for the second epoch,
which results in an isotropic radio luminosity of (6.0 +/- 0.3) * 10^{36} ergs
between 1.4 and 43.3 GHz, at an adopted distance of 13.1 Mpc. Finally, we
report on an XMM-Newton X-ray detection of SN2001gd on 18 December 2002. The
supernova X-ray spectrum is consistent with optically thin emission from a soft
component (associated with emission from the reverse shock) at a temperature
around 1 keV. The observed flux corresponds to an isotropic X-ray luminosity of
L_X = 1.4 +/- 0.4 * 10^{39} ergs/s in the (0.3-5) keV band. We suggest that
both radio and X-ray observations of SN2001gd indicate that a circumstellar
interaction similar to that displayed by SN1993J in M81 is taking place.",2005-04-28T20:02:50Z
"Correlation of the estimated arrival time of the relativistic solar ions
  at 1 AU and start of ground level enhancement (GLE)","We are investigated possible correlations between the calculated arrival
times of the first relativistic ions at Earth and GLE start times registered by
surface monitors. The analysis is based on the arrival times and energies of
the first solar ions, registered by the Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) on
board of the ACE satellite, and protons, registered by GOES satellites. We
consider both cases when the interplanetary propagation of the first high
energy ions is essentially scatter-free and the diffusion of high energy ions
during propagation in the interplanetary magnetic field. We extrapolate the
time-velocity and time-rigidity relationships to calculate the expected arrival
times of the relativistic ions that are energetic enough to enter the
atmosphere at the Aragats geographical location and produce secondary fluxes
that reach the monitors.",2005-07-18T18:43:19Z
"NGC 146: A young open cluster with a Herbig Be star and intermediate
  mass pre-main sequence stars","We present UBV CCD photometry and low-resolution spectra of stars in the
field of the young open cluster NGC 146. UBV photometry of 434 stars were used
to estimate the E(B$-$V) reddening of 0.55 $\pm$ 0.04 mag and BV photometry of
976 stars were used to estimate a distance modulus of (m$-$M)$_0$ = 12.7
$\pm$0.2 mag, corresponding to a distance of 3470$^{+335}_{-305}$ pc. We
estimated 10 -- 16 Myr as the turn-off age for the upper main sequence of the
cluster using isochrones and synthetic colour magnitude diagrams. We identified
two B type stars with H$_\alpha$ in emission and located on the MS using
slit-less spectra. A higher resolution spectrum of the brighter Be star
indicated the presence of a number of emission lines, with some lines showing
the signature of gas infall. This star was found to be located in the region of
Herbig Ae/Be stars in the (J$-$H) vs (H$-$K) colour-colour diagram. Thus, we
identify this star as a Herbig Be star. On the other hand, 54 stars were found
to show near infrared excess, of which 17 were found to be located in the
region of Herbig Ae/Be stars and 18 stars were found to be located in the
region of Be stars in the NIR colour-colour diagram. Thus NGC 146 is a young
cluster with a large number of intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars. The
turn-on age of the cluster is found to be $\sim$ 3 Myr. Though NGC 146 shows an
older turn off, the bulk of stars in this cluster seems to belong to the
younger population of 3 Myr.",2005-05-16T04:36:07Z
The properties of Galactic globular cluster sub-systems,"In this paper we compare the properties of three sub-systems of Galactic
globular clusters, which are defined according to metallicity and HB
morphology. We focus on cluster luminosities, structures, surface brightnesses
(SB) and ellipticities. It is shown that the so-called ""young"" halo (YH)
clusters, which may have been formed in external satellite galaxies, exhibit
characteristics clearly distinct from those of the ""old"" halo (OH) and
bulge/disk (BD) clusters, the majority of which are believed to be Galactic
natives. The YH clusters have properties most similar to those of clusters
belonging to several present day satellite dwarf galaxies. The OH and BD
populations have apparently been modified by destructive tidal forces in the
inner Galaxy. We estimate that the present population of Galactic natives may
only represent some two-thirds of the original population. Several low SB
clusters are highly flattened. We briefly speculate that this ellipticity may
represent the intrinsic flattening of dark matter mini-halos in which such
optically dim clusters might be embedded. Finally, we examine the distribution
of clusters on the size vs.luminosity plane. Three objects fall above the sharp
upper envelope of the main distribution on this plane: Omega Cen, M54, and NGC
2419. All three have previously, and independently, been suggested to be the
stripped cores of former dwarf galaxies. This suspicion is strengthened by the
observation that the massive cluster G1 in M31, plus a number of the most
luminous clusters in NGC 5128 also fall in the same region of the plane. All of
these objects have also previously been suggested to be the stripped cores of
now-defunct dwarf galaxies.",2005-04-06T11:02:00Z
A Gamma-Ray Bursts' Fluence-Duration Correlation,"We present an analysis indicating that there is a correlation between the
fluences and the durations of gamma-ray bursts, and provide arguments that this
reflects a correlation between the total emitted energies and the intrinsic
durations. For the short (long) bursts the total emitted energies are roughly
proportional to the first (second) power of the intrinsic duration. This
difference in the energy-duration relationship is statistically significant,
and may provide an interesting constraint on models aiming to explain the short
and long gamma-ray bursts.",2005-08-01T05:51:38Z
The Small-Scale Power Spectrum of Cold Dark Matter,"One of the best motivated hypotheses in cosmology states that most of the
matter in the universe is in the form of weakly-interacting massive particles
that decoupled early in the history of the universe and cooled adiabatically to
an extremely low temperature. Nevertheless, the finite temperature and horizon
scales at which these particles decoupled imprint generic signatures on their
small scales density fluctuations. We show that the previously recognized
cut-off in the fluctuation power-spectrum due to free-streaming of particles at
the thermal speed of decoupling, is supplemented by acoustic oscillations owing
to the initial coupling between the cold dark matter (CDM) and the radiation
field. The power-spectrum oscillations appear on the scale of the horizon at
thermal decoupling which corresponds to a mass scale of
\~10^{-4}*(T_d/10MeV)^{-3} solar masses for a CDM decoupling temperature T_d.
The suppression of the power-spectrum on smaller scales by the acoustic
oscillations is physically independent from the free-streaming effect, although
the two cut-off scales are coincidentally comparable for T_d~10MeV and a
particle mass of M~100GeV. The initial conditions for recent numerical
simulations of the earliest and smallest objects to have formed in the
universe, need to be modified accordingly. The smallest dark matter clumps may
be detectable through gamma-ray production from particle annihilation, through
fluctuations in the event rate of direct detection experiments, or through
their tidal gravitational effect on wide orbits of objects near the outer edge
of the solar system.",2005-04-05T16:10:40Z
"Scalar Field Models: From the Pioneer Anomaly to Astrophysical
  Constraints","In this work we study how scalar fields may affect solar observables, and use
the constraint on the Sun's central temperature to extract bounds on the
parameters of relevant models. Also, a scalar field driven by a suitable
potential is shown to produce an anomalous acceleration similar to the one
found in the Pioneer anomaly.",2005-05-17T00:25:38Z
A brief introduction to cosmic topology,"Whether we live in a spatially finite universe, and what its shape and size
may be, are among the fundamental long-standing questions in cosmology. These
questions of topological nature have become particularly topical, given the
wealth of increasingly accurate astro-cosmological observations, especially the
recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. An overview
of the basic context of cosmic topology, the detectability constraints from
recent observations, as well as the main methods for its detection and some
recent results are briefly presented.",2005-04-16T22:40:27Z
Probing the Local Group Medium Toward Mkn 421 with Chandra and FUSE,"We report the detection of highly-ionized gas at z~0 seen in resonant UV and
X-ray absorption lines toward the z=0.03 blazar Mkn 421. A total of 13 X-ray
and 3 UV lines were measured (or upper limits derived), including three lines
in the OVII K-series and K\alpha transitions from neon, carbon, and nitrogen.
  From the three OVII lines we derive a 2\sigma Doppler parameter constraint of
24<b<55 km/s. The FUSE spectrum shows strong Galactic low--velocity OVI 1032A
absorption as well as a possible weak OVI high-velocity component (HVC). The
Doppler parameter of the low-velocity OVI measured with FUSE is ~3\sigma higher
than that derived from the OVII line ratios, indicating that the OVII and
Galactic OVI arise in different phases. This velocity dispersion, along with
limits on the gas temperature and density from the X-ray line ratios (assuming
a single phase with collisional ionization equilibrium plus photoionization)
are all consistent with an extragalactic absorber. However, the OVII Doppler
parameter is inconsistent with the high temperature required to produce the
observed OVI_HVC/OVII ratio, implying that the HVC is probably not related to
the OVII. In addition, the OVI_K\alpha line detected by Chandra implies a
column density ~4 times higher than the 1032A absorption. Although an
extragalactic absorber is fully consistent with the measured column density
ratios, a Galactic origin cannot be ruled out given the uncertainties in the
available data.",2005-04-26T15:20:07Z
Dusty Infrared Galaxies: Sources of the Cosmic Infrared Background,"The discovery of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) in 1996, together with
recent cosmological surveys from the mid-infrared to the millimeter have
revolutionized our view of star formation at high redshifts. It has become
clear, in the last decade, that a population of galaxies that radiate most of
their power in the far-infrared (the so-called ``infrared galaxies'')
contributes an important part of the whole galaxy build-up in the Universe.
Since 1996, detailed (and often painful) investigations of the high-redshift
infrared galaxies have resulted in the spectacular progress covered in this
review. We outline the nature of the sources of the CIB including their
star-formation rate, stellar and total mass, morphology, metallicity and
clustering properties. We discuss their contribution to the stellar content of
the Universe and their origin in the framework of the hierarchical growth of
structures. We finally discuss open questions for a scenario of their evolution
up to the present-day galaxies.",2005-07-12T20:05:53Z
Coupled Evolution of Primordial Gravity Waves and Relic Neutrinos,"We describe analytically the cosmological evolution of primordial gravity
waves (tensor perturbations) taking into account their coupling to relic
neutrinos. We prove that as a consequence of causality the neutrino-induced
phase shift of subhorizon tensor oscillations tends on small scales to zero.
For the tensor modes that reenter the horizon in the radiation era after
neutrino decoupling we calculate the neutrino suppression factor as
1-5rho_nu/9rho+O[(rho_nu/rho)^2]. This result is consistent with the value
obtained for three neutrino flavors by Weinberg and is in agreement with
numerical Boltzmann evolution. A minimal formula with the correct asymptotic
form on small and large scales reproduces to about ten percent the evolution on
all scales probed by the CMB. A more accurate solution (in terms of elementary
functions) shows that the modes reentering the horizon in the radiation era are
slightly enhanced and the phase of their temporal oscillations is shifted by
subdominant nonrelativistic matter. The phase shift grows logarithmically on
subhorizon scales until radiation-matter equality; the accumulated shift scales
for k>>k_eq as (ln k)/k. The modes reentering the horizon after equality are,
in turn, affected by the residual radiation density. These modes follow the
naive matter-era evolution which is advanced by a redshift and scale
independent increment of conformal time. In an appendix, we introduce a general
relativistic measure of radiation intensity that in any gauge obeys a simple
transport equation and for decoupled particles is conserved on superhorizon
scales for arbitrary initial conditions in the full nonlinear theory.",2005-05-24T21:38:09Z
The Spherical Accretion Shock Instability in the Linear Regime,"We use time-dependent, axisymmetric, hydrodynamic simulations to study the
linear stability of the stalled, spherical accretion shock that arises in the
post-bounce phase of core-collapse supernovae. We show that this accretion
shock is stable to radial modes, with decay rates and oscillation frequencies
in close agreement with the linear stability analysis of Houck and Chevalier.
For non-spherical perturbations we find that the l=1 mode is always unstable
for parameters appropriate to core-collapse supernovae. We also find that the
l=2 mode is unstable, but typically has a growth rate smaller than that for
l=1. Furthermore, the l=1 mode is the only mode found to transition into a
nonlinear stage in our simulations. This result provides a possible explanation
for the dominance of an l=1 'sloshing' mode seen in many two-dimensional
simulations of core-collapse supernovae.",2005-07-07T19:24:50Z
Neutrino statistics and big bang nucleosynthesis,"Neutrinos may possibly violate the spin-statistics theorem, and hence obey
Bose statistics or mixed statistics despite having spin half. We find the
generalized equilibrium distribution function of neutrinos which depends on a
single fermi-bose parameter, \kappa, and interpolates continuously between the
bosonic and fermionic distributions when \kappa changes from -1 to +1. We
consider modification of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the presence of
bosonic or partly bosonic neutrinos. For pure bosonic neutrinos the abundances
change (in comparison with the usual Fermi-Dirac case) by -3.2% for 4He (which
is equivalent to a decrease of the effective number of neutrinos by \Delta
N_\nu = - 0.6), +2.6% for 2H and -7% for 7Li. These changes provide a better
fit to the BBN data. Future BBN studies will be able to constrain the
fermi-bose parameter to \kappa > 0.5, if no deviation from fermionic nature of
neutrinos is found. We also evaluate the sensitivity of future CMB and LSS
observations to the fermi-bose parameter.",2005-03-29T09:15:56Z
"Fourier Resolved Spectroscopy of the XMM-Newton Observations of MCG
  -6-30-15","We study the Frequency Resolved Spectra of the Seyfert galaxy MCG -6-30-15
obtained during two recent XMM-Newton observations. Splitting the Fourier
spectra in soft (<2 keV) and hard (>2 keV) bands, we find that the soft band
has a variability amplitude larger than the hard one on time scales longer than
10 ksec, while the opposite is true on time scales shorter than 3 ksec. Both
the soft and hard band spectra are well fitted by power laws of different
indices. The spectra of the hard band become clearly softer as the Fourier
Frequency decreases from 7x10^{-4} Hz to 10^{-5} Hz, while the spectral slope
of the soft band power law component is independent of the Fourier frequency.
The well known broad Fe Ka feature is absent at all frequency bins; this result
implies that this feature is not variable on time scales shorter than ~10^5
sec, in agreement with recent line variability studies. Strong spectral
features are also present in the soft X-ray band (at E~0.7), clearly
discernible in all Fourier Frequency bins. This fact is consistent with the
assumption that they are due to absorption by intervening matter within the
source.",2005-06-14T08:32:56Z
The connection between shear and star formation in spiral galaxies,"We present a sample of 33 galaxies for which we have calculated (i) the
average rate of shear from publish rotation curves, (ii) the far-infrared
luminosity from IRAS fluxes and (iii) The K-band luminosity from 2MASS. We show
that a correlation exists between the shear rate and the ratio of the
far-infrared to K-band luminosity. This ratio is essentially a measure of the
star formation rate per unit mass, or the specific star formation rate. From
this correlation we show that a critical shear rate exists, above which star
formation would turn off in the disks of spiral galaxies. Using the correlation
between shear rate and spiral arm pitch angle, this shear rate corresponds to
the lowest pitch angles typically measured in near-infrared images of spiral
galaxies.",2005-04-25T17:40:51Z
"Modeling the Physical Structure of the Low Density Pre-protostellar Core
  Lynds 1498","Lynds 1498 is a pre-protostellar core (PPC) and was one of the initial
objects toward which molecular depletion and differentiation was detected.
Despite the considerable scrutiny of L1498, there has not been a extensive
study of the density and temperature structure as derived from radiative
transfer modeling of dust continuum observations. We present deep SCUBA
observations of L1498 at 850 and 450 micron, high resolution BEARS maps of the
N2H+ 1-0 transition, CSO observations of the N2H+ 3-2 transition, and GBT
observations of the C3S 4-3 transition. We also present a comparison of derived
properties between L1498 and nearby PPCs that have been observed at
far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. We present a more realistic
treatment of PPC heating which varies the strength of the ISRF, Sisrf, and
includes attenuation of the ISRF due to dust grains at the outer radius of the
core, Av. The best-fitted model consists of a Bonner-Ebert sphere with a
central density of 1 - 3 x 10^4 cm-3, R_o ~ 0.29 pc, 0.5 <= Sisrf <= 1, Av ~ 1
mag, and a nearly isothermal temperature profile of ~ 10.5 K for OH8 opacities.
C3S emission shows a central depletion hole while N2H+ emission is centrally
peaked. The observed depletions of C3S and H2CO, the modest N2H+ abundance, and
a central density that is an order of magnitude lower than other modeled PPCs
suggests that L1498 may be a forming PPC. Our derived temperature and density
profile will improve modeling of molecular line observations that will
explicate the core's kinematical and chemical state. (abridged)",2005-05-09T19:10:42Z
"The Stellar Content of Nearby Star-Forming Galaxies. III. Unravelling
  the Nature of the Diffuse Ultraviolet Light","We investigate the nature of the diffuse intra-cluster ultraviolet light seen
in twelve local starburst galaxies, using long-slit ultraviolet spectroscopy
obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST). We take this faint intra-cluster light to be the field
in each galaxy, and compare its spectroscopic signature with STARBURST99
evolutionary synthesis models and with neighboring star clusters. Our main
result is that the diffuse ultraviolet light in eleven of the twelve starbursts
lacks the strong O-star wind features that are clearly visible in spectra of
luminous clusters in the same galaxies. The difference in stellar features
dominating cluster and field spectra indicate that the field light originates
primarily from a different stellar population, and not from scattering of UV
photons leaking out of the massive clusters. We consider several scenarios to
understand the lack of observed O stars in the field, and their implications
for the origin of the field stellar population. If the field stellar
populations formed in situ, the field must either have an IMF which is steeper
than Salpeter (3.0-3.5) or a Salpeter slope with an upper mass cutoff of 30-50
solar masses. If star formation occurs primarily in star clusters, the field
could be composed of older, faded clusters, and/or a population which is coeval
with the luminous clusters but lower in mass. If the field is composed of
older, dissolving clusters, we estimate that star clusters (regardless of mass)
need to dissolve on timescales 7-10 Myr to create the field (abridged).",2005-05-02T14:13:45Z
"VLT Spectroscopy of Globular Cluster Systems, I. The Photometric and
  Spectroscopic Dataset","We present Lick line-index measurements of extragalactic globular clusters in
seven early-type galaxies (NGC 1380, 2434, 3115, 3379, 3585, 5846, and 7192)
with different morphological types (E-S0) located in field and group/cluster
environments. High-quality spectra were taken with the FORS2 instrument at
ESO's Very Large Telescope. About 50% of our data allow an age resolution dt/t
~ 0.3 and a metallicity resolution ~0.25-0.4 dex, depending on the absolute
metallicity. Globular cluster candidates are selected from deep B, V, R, I, K
FORS2/ISAAC photometry with 80-100% success rate inside one effective radius.
Using combined optical/near-infrared colour-colour diagrams we present a method
to efficiently reduce fore-/background contamination down to <10%. We find
clear signs for bi-modality in the globular cluster colour distributions of NGC
1380, 3115, and 3585. The colour distributions of globular clusters in NGC
2434, 3379, 5846, and 7192 are consistent with a broad single-peak
distribution. For the analysed globular cluster systems the slopes of projected
radial surface density profiles, of the form Sigma(R) ~ R^-Gamma, vary between
~0.8 and 2.6. Using globular clusters as a tracer population we determine total
dynamical masses of host galaxies out to large radii (~1.6 - 4.8 Reff). For the
sample we find masses in the range ~8.8*10^10 Msolar up to ~1.2*10^12 Msolar.
The line index data presented here will be used in accompanying papers of this
series to derive ages, metallicities and abundance ratios. A compilation of
currently available high-quality Lick index measurements for globular clusters
in elliptical, lenticular, and late-type galaxies is provided and will serve to
augment the current data set. [abridged]",2005-05-20T17:11:31Z
"The Optical - Infrared Colors of CORALS QSOs: Searching for Dust
  Reddening Associated With High Redshift Damped Lyman Alpha Systems","The presence of dust in quasar absorbers, such as damped Lyman alpha (DLA)
systems, may cause the background QSO to appear reddened. We investigate the
extent of this potential reddening by comparing the optical-to-infrared (IR)
colors of QSOs with and without intervening absorbers. Our QSO sample is based
on the Complete Optical and Radio Absorption Line System (CORALS) survey of
Ellison et al (2001). We have obtained near-simultaneous B and K band
magnitudes for subset of the CORALS sample and supplemented our observations
with further measurements published in the literature. To account for
redshift-related color changes, the B-K colors are normalized using the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) QSO composite. The mean normalized B-K color of the
DLA sub-sample is +0.12, whereas the mean for the no-DLA sample is -0.10; both
distributions have RMS scatters ~0.5. Neither a student's T-test nor a KS test
indicate that there is any significant difference between the two color
distributions. Based on simulations which redden the colors of QSOs with
intervening DLAs, we determine a reddening limit which corresponds to E(B-V) <
0.04 (SMC-like extinction) at 99% confidence (3 sigma), assuming that E(B-V) is
the same for all DLAs. Finally, we do not find any general correlation between
absorber properties (such as [Fe/Zn] or neutral hydrogen column density) and
B-K color. One of these two QSOs shows evidence for strong associated
absorption from X-ray observations, an alternative explanation for its very red
color. We conclude that the presence of intervening galaxies causes a minimal
reddening of the background QSO.",2005-07-18T20:05:30Z
"Finding Young Stellar Populations in Elliptical Galaxies from
  Independent Components of Optical Spectra","Elliptical galaxies are believed to consist of a single population of old
stars formed together at an early epoch in the Universe, yet recent analyses of
galaxy spectra seem to indicate the presence of significant younger populations
of stars in them. The detailed physical modelling of such populations is
computationally expensive, inhibiting the detailed analysis of the several
million galaxy spectra becoming available over the next few years. Here we
present a data mining application aimed at decomposing the spectra of
elliptical galaxies into several coeval stellar populations, without the use of
detailed physical models. This is achieved by performing a linear independent
basis transformation that essentially decouples the initial problem of joint
processing of a set of correlated spectral measurements into that of the
independent processing of a small set of prototypical spectra. Two methods are
investigated: (1) A fast projection approach is derived by exploiting the
correlation structure of neighboring wavelength bins within the spectral data.
(2) A factorisation method that takes advantage of the positivity of the
spectra is also investigated. The preliminary results show that typical
features observed in stellar population spectra of different evolutionary
histories can be convincingly disentangled by these methods, despite the
absence of input physics. The success of this basis transformation analysis in
recovering physically interpretable representations indicates that this
technique is a potentially powerful tool for astronomical data mining.",2005-05-03T13:59:57Z
"The precision of large radio continuum source catalogues- An application
  of the SPECFIND tool","The accuracy in position and flux density of 19 large radio continuum source
catalogues has been determined using SPECFIND, a new tool recently made
available through the CDS. The ~67000 radio continuum spectra with three or
more frequencies produced by SPECFIND were used to cross-correlate sources from
different catalogues and to calculate offsets in right ascension and
declination in the various catalogues with respect to the positions given in
the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalogue, which was adopted as a reference. The
flux densities reported in the catalogues were compared to those predicted by
the composite spectra, enabling us to assess the quality of the flux density
calibration of the different catalogues.",2005-03-30T15:27:08Z
Structure in the motions of the fastest halo stars,"We have analyzed the catalog of 2106 non-kinematically selected metal poor
stars in the solar neighborhood published by Beers et al. (2000), with the goal
of quantifying the amount of substructure in the motions of the fastest halo
stars. We have computed the two-point velocity correlation function for a
subsample of halo stars within 1-2 kpc of the Sun, and found statistical
evidence of substructure, with a similar amplitude to that predicted by high
resolution CDM simulations. The signal is due to a small kinematic group whose
dynamical properties are compared to the stellar ""stream"", previously
discovered by Helmi et al. (1999). If real, this high velocity moving group
would provide further support to the idea that substructures remain as fossils
from the formation of the Galaxy as expected in the CDM scenario.",2005-04-05T15:28:44Z
Abundances on the Main Sequence of the Globular Cluster Omega Centauri,"Using the 2dF multi-fibre instrument on the AAT, moderate resolution spectra
have been obtained for a large sample of stars on the main sequence and at the
turnoff in the unusual globular cluster omega Centauri. We investigate the
behaviour of CH, CN and SrII line strength indices as a function of overall
abundance for the main sequence sample. A number of stars do not follow the
relations defined by the majority. These anomalous objects can be categorised
into (at least) three types. (1) Carbon enhanced stars, which represent about
5% of the sample, and which are found at all metallicities. Spectrum synthesis
calculations show that the atmospheres of these stars are typically enhanced in
C by factors of between 3 and 10. (2) Nitrogen enhanced stars, revealed for
[Fe/H] > -1.3 by strong CN indices, which make up ~40% of the cluster main
sequence population above this metallicity. These stars are enhanced in N by
factors of up to 100. Our data, however, provide no constraints of their
relative numbers at lower [Fe/H]. (3) Stars with enhancements of the s-process
element Sr by factors of 30 to 60. The possible origins for these abundance
anomalies are discussed.",2005-07-07T10:46:00Z
"Two approaches to the cosmic ray ""knee"" problem and the experimental
  data","Two approaches to the old problem of the so-called ""knee"" in cosmic ray
spectrum are compared with the existing experimental data. It is shown that
""standard astrophysical model"" of the knee is not supported by some
experimental data, while the alternative model agrees better with the data.",2005-07-01T10:34:57Z
"Globular Cluster Systems in Brightest Cluster Galaxies: Bimodal
  Metallicity Distributions and the Nature of the High-Luminosity Clusters","We present new (B,I) photometry for the globular cluster systems in eight
Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs), obtained with the ACS/WFC camera on the
Hubble Space Telescope. In the very rich cluster systems that reside within
these giant galaxies, we find that all have strongly bimodal color
distributions All the BCGs show population gradients, with much higher relative
numbers of red clusters within 5 kpc of their centers, consistent with their
having formed at later times than the blue, metal-poor population. A striking
new feature of the color distributions emerging from our data is that for the
brightest clusters (M_I < -10.5) the color distribution becomes broad and less
obviously bimodal. we suggest that it may be a characteristic of many BCGs.
Furthermore, the blue (metal-poor) clusters become progressively redder with
increasing luminosity, following a mass/metallicity scaling relation Z ~
M^0.55. We argue that these GCS characteristics are consistent with a
hierarchical-merging formation picture in which the metal-poor clusters formed
in protogalactic clouds or dense starburst complexes with gas masses in the
range 10^7 - 10^10 M_Sun, but where the more massive clusters on average formed
in bigger clouds with deeper potential wells where more pre-enrichment could
occur.",2005-08-08T20:59:33Z
Testing the Rate of False Planetary Transits due to Binary Star Blending,"We investigate the rate of false planetary transit detection due to blending
with eclipsing binaries. Our approach is purely empirical and is based on the
analysis of the artificially blended light curves of the eclipsing binary stars
in the Large Magellanic Cloud from the archive of the Optical Gravitational
Lensing Experiment (OGLE). Employing parameters that characterize the
significance of the transit and the amplitude of the variation out of the
transit, we can substantially limit the number of potential false positives.
Further constraint comes from the expected length of the transit by a possible
planetary companion. By the application of these criteria we are left only with
18 candidates from the full sample of 2495 stars. Visual inspection of these
remaining variables eliminates all of them for obvious reasons (e.g., for
visible fingerprints of orbital eccentricity). We draw the attention to the
short-period stars, where the false alarm rate is especially low.",2005-08-02T16:15:08Z
On the nature of the S stars in the Galactic Center,"Davies and King have suggested that the bright stars observed on short-period
orbits about Sgr A* (``S stars'') are old, low-mass stripped AGB stars rather
than young, high-mass main-sequence stars. If the observationally inferred
effective temperatures and luminosities of these stars are correct, however,
then DK have grossly overestimated the post-AGB lifetimes and hence
underestimated the production rate in steady state. In fact, the total mass in
stars stripped over the age of the Galaxy would exceed that of the stellar cusp
bound to Sgr A*. We take issue also with Davies & King's estimates of the
energetics involved in capturing the stars onto their present orbits.",2005-04-04T19:03:23Z
"Oxygen isotopic ratios in galactic clouds along the line of sight
  towards Sagittarius B2","As an independent check on previous measurements of the isotopic abundance of
oxygen through the Galaxy, we present a detailed analysis of the ground state
rotational lines of 16OH and 18OH in absorption towards the giant molecular
cloud complex, Sagittarius B2. We have modelled the line shapes to separate the
contribution of several galactic clouds along the line of sight and calculate
16OH/18OH ratios for each of these features. The best fitting values are in the
range 320-540, consistent with the previous measurements in the Galactic Disk
but slightly higher than the standard ratio in the Galactic Centre. They do not
show clear evidence for a gradient in the isotopic ratio with galactocentric
distance. The individual 16OH column densities relative to water give ratios of
[H2O/OH]=0.6-1.2, similar in magnitude to galactic clouds in the sight lines
towards W51 and W49. A comparison with CH indicates [OH/CH] ratios higher than
has been previously observed in diffuse clouds. We estimate OH abundances of
10^-7 - 10^-6 in the line of sight features.",2005-04-07T10:27:20Z
Nuclear fusion in dense matter: Reaction rate and carbon burning,"In this paper we analyze the nuclear fusion rate between equal nuclei for all
five different nuclear burning regimes in dense matter (two thermonuclear
regimes, two pycnonuclear ones, and the intermediate regime). The rate is
determined by Coulomb barrier penetration in dense environments and by the
astrophysical S-factor at low energies. We evaluate previous studies of the
Coulomb barrier problem and propose a simple phenomenological formula for the
reaction rate which covers all cases. The parameters of this formula can be
varied, taking into account current theoretical uncertainties in the reaction
rate. The results are illustrated for the example of the ^{12}C+^{12}C fusion
reaction. This reaction is very important for the understanding of nuclear
burning in evolved stars, in exploding white dwarfs producing type Ia
supernovae, and in accreting neutron stars. The S-factor at stellar energies
depends on a reliable fit and extrapolation of the experimental data. We
calculate the energy dependence of the S-factor using a recently developed
parameter-free model for the nuclear interaction, taking into account the
effects of the Pauli nonlocality. For illustration, we analyze the efficiency
of carbon burning in a wide range of densities and temperatures of stellar
matter with the emphasis on carbon ignition at densities rho > 10^9 g/cc.",2005-06-16T14:55:08Z
Observational constraints on the dark energy density evolution,"We constrain the evolution of the dark energy density from Cosmic Microwave
Background, Large Scale Structure and Supernovae Ia measurements. While
Supernovae Ia are most sensitive to the equation of state $w_0$ of dark energy
today, the Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure data best
constrains the dark energy evolution at earlier times. For the parametrization
used in our models, we find $w_0 < -0.8$ and the dark energy fraction at very
high redshift $\Omega_{early} < 0.03$ at 95 per cent confidence level.",2005-08-04T13:38:07Z
"RR Lyrae search and stellar populations study in Canis Major:
  Preliminary Results","We present preliminary results of a RR Lyrae star search and stellar
populations study performed in the Canis Major overdensity, spanning an area of
8.35sq deg. The observations were made in R and V bands, with the QUEST camera
installed in the 1m Jurgen Stock Telescope, at the Venezuela National
Observatory. The resulting Hess diagram shows a possible, but weak, red giant
branch and no obvious horizontal branch, red clump or main sequence turnoff.
After a multi--epoch photometric search, 6 RR Lyrae stars were confirmed with
further observations obtained at the 1.0 and 1.3m telescopes of the SMARTS
consortium at CTIO. Of these confirmed RR Lyrae stars, 5 have heliocentric
distances between 5 and 7 kpc. Confirmation of their physsical association with
the Canis Major system awaits for a study of their radial velocities.",2005-04-14T19:48:26Z
"X-Ray Flares of Sun-Like Young Stellar Objects and Their Effects on
  Protoplanetary Disks","Astronomical observations of flares from analogs of the early Sun have the
potential to give critical insights into the high energy irradiation
environment of protoplanetary disks. Solar-mass young stellar objects are
significantly more X-ray luminous than the typical low-mass T Tauri star. They
undergo frequent strong flaring on a several day time scale. Very powerful
flares also occur, but on a longer time frame. The hard X-ray spectrum of these
stars become even harder during flaring. The X-rays from these sun-like young
stellar objects have the potential to ionize circumstellar material out to
large distances. Three specific illustrations are given of the effects of the
X-rays: The physics and chemistry of the atmospheres of the inner accretion
disks; the ionization level at the disk midplane, important for the viability
of the magnetorotational instability; and the nuclear fluence in the
irradiation zone just interior to the inner edge of the disk, important in
local irradiation scenarios for producing the short-lived radionuclides found
in meteorites.",2005-05-27T17:12:52Z
"HST and UKIRT Observations of the Center of the Trifid Nebula: Evidence
  for the Photoevaporation of a Proplyd and a Protostellar Condensation","The Trifid nebula (M20) is a well-known prominent optical HII region
trisected by bands of obscuring dust lanes and excited by an O7.5 star HD
164492A. Previous near-IR, mid-IR and radio continuum observations of the
cluster of stars at the center of the Trifid nebula indicated circumstellar
disks associated with hot stars with envelopes that are photoionized externally
by the UV radiation from the hot central star, HD 164492A. Using WFPC2 of the
HST, we present evidence of a resolved proplyd in H$\alpha$ and [SII] line
emission from a stellar source emitting cool dust emission. Using UKIRT, an
infrared observation of the stellar source with a proplyd indicates a late F --
mid G spectral type. We also note a remarkable complex of filamentary and
sheet-like structures which appear to arise from the edge of a protostellar
condensation. These observations are consistent with a picture in which the
bright massive star HD 164492A is responsible for the photoevaporation of
protoplanetary disks of other less-massive members of the cluster as well as
the closest protostellar condensation facing the central cluster. Using the
evidence for a proplyd, we argue that the massive and intermediate mass members
of the cluster, HD 164492C (B6 star) and HD 164492 (Herbig Be star) have disks
associated with them.",2005-05-08T17:04:32Z
Diffuse polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster,"We report on full-polarization radio observations of the Perseus cluster
(Abell 426) using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at
wavelengths from 81-95 cm. We have employed a novel technique, Rotation Measure
synthesis (Brentjens and de Bruyn, 2005) to unravel the polarization properties
of the emission across the full field of view and detect polarized emission
over a wide range of RM from about 0 to 90 rad m^-2. The low RM emission is
associated with our Galaxy, while the high RM emission is associated with the
Perseus cluster. The latter reaches typical surface brightness levels of 0.5-1
mJy per beam and must be rather highly polarized. Most of the peripheral
polarized emission appears too bright, by about 1-2 orders of magnitude, to be
explainable as Thomson scattered emission of the central radio source off the
thermal electrons in the cluster. The bulk of the emission associated with the
Perseus cluster is probably related to buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma,
probably relics from still active or now dormant AGN within the cluster. A
lenticular shaped structure measuring 0.5-1 Mpc is strikingly similar to the
structures predicted by Ensslin et al. (1998). At the western edge of the
cluster, we detect very long, linear structures that may be related to shocks
caused by infall of gas into the Perseus cluster.",2005-07-14T15:14:41Z
"Implications of Halo Inside-out Growth on the X-Ray Properties of Nearby
  Galaxy Systems within the Preheating Scenario","We present an entirely analytic model for a preheated, polytropic
intergalactic medium in hydrostatic equilibrium within a NFW dark halo
potential in which the evolution of the halo structure between major merger
events proceeds inside-out by accretion. This model is used to explain, within
a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony, the observed X-ray properties of nearby
relaxed, non-cooling flow groups and clusters of galaxies. We find that our
preferred solution to the equilibrium equations produces scaling relations in
excellent agreement with observations, while simultaneously accounting for the
typical structural characteristics of the distribution of the diffuse baryons.
In the class of preheating models, ours stands out because it offers a unified
description of the intrahalo medium for galaxy systems with total masses above
$\sm 2\times 10^{13}$\msun, does not produce baryonic configurations with large
isentropic cores, and reproduces faithfully the observed behavior of the gas
entropy at large radii. All this is achieved with a moderate level of energy
injection of about half a keV, which can be easily accommodated within the
limits of the total energy released by the most commonly invoked feedback
mechanisms, as well as with a polytropic index of 1.2, consistent with both
many observational determinations and predictions from high-resolution
gas-dynamical simulations of non-cooling flow clusters. More interestingly, our
scheme offers a physical motivation for the adoption of this specific value of
the polytropic index, as it is the one that best ensures the conservation after
halo virialization of the balance between the total specific energies of the
gas and dark matter components for the full range of masses investigated.",2005-04-13T17:55:23Z
"Subaru Super Deep Field with Adaptive Optics I. Observations and First
  Implications","We present a deep $K^{\prime}$-band (2.12$\mu$m) imaging of 1\arcmin\
$\times$ 1\arcmin Subaru Super Deep Field (SSDF) taken with the Subaru adaptive
optics (AO) system. Total integration time of 26.8 hours results in the
limiting magnitude of $K^{\prime} \sim 24.7$ (5$\sigma$, 0\farcs2 aperture) for
point sources and $K^{\prime} \sim 23.5$ (5$\sigma$, 0\farcs6 aperture) for
galaxies, which is the deepest limit ever achieved in the $K^{\prime}$ band.
The average stellar FWHM of the co-added image is 0\farcs18. Based on the
photometric measurements of detected galaxies, we obtained the differential
galaxy number counts, for the first time, down to $K^{\prime} \sim 25$, which
is more than 0.5 mag deeper than the previous data. We found that the number
count slope $d\log N/dm$ is about 0.15 at $22 < K^{\prime} < 25$, which is
flatter than the previous data. Therefore, detected galaxies in the SSDF have
only negligible contribution to the near-infrared extragalactic background
light (EBL), and the discrepancy claimed so far between the diffuse EBL
measurements and the estimated EBL from galaxy count integration has become
more serious . The size distribution of detected galaxies was obtained down to
the area size of less than 0.1 arcsec$^2$, which is less than a half of the
previous data in the $K^{\prime}$ band. We compared the observed size-magnitude
relation with a simple pure luminosity evolution model allowing for intrinsic
size evolution, and found that a model with no size evolution gives the best
fit to the data. It implies that the surface brightness of galaxies at high
redshift is not much different from that expected from the size-luminosity
relation of present-day galaxies.",2005-05-17T15:12:42Z
"Using Spitzer Colors as Diagnostics of Star Formation Regions: The
  Interacting Galaxy Arp 107","We present Spitzer infrared imaging of the peculiar galaxy pair Arp 107, and
compare with an optical H-alpha map and a numerical model of the interaction.
The [3.6 micron] - [4.5 micron] colors of clumps in the galaxy do not vary
around the ring-like primary spiral arm and are consistent with those of stars,
thus these bands are dominated by starlight. In contrast, the [5.8 micron] -
[8.0 micron] colors are consistent with those of interstellar dust, and vary by
about 0.2 magnitudes around the ring/spiral, with redder colors associated with
regions with stronger star formation as indicated by H-alpha and mid-infrared
luminosity. The [4.5 micron] - [5.8 micron] colors for clumps in this arm are
bluer than dust and redder than stars, and vary by 1.3 magnitudes around the
arm. This color is therefore a measure of the relative number of young stars to
old stars, with a redder color indicating a higher proportion of young stars.
There is a clear azimuthal sequence in the [4.5] - [5.8] color around the arm,
indicating a sequence in average stellar age. The L(H-alpha)/L(8.0 micron)
ratio varies around the arm by a factor of ~7; this variation may be due to
extinction or to PAH excitation by non-ionizing photons. Our model of Arp 107
accounts for the general morphology of the system, and explains the age
variation along the arm as the result of differences in the time of maximum
compression in the arm. Using Spitzer colors, we are able to distinguish
background quasars and foreground stars from star forming regions associated
with Arp 107.",2005-07-28T15:34:26Z
"On the role of injection in kinetic approaches to nonlinear particle
  acceleration at non-relativistic shock waves","The dynamical reaction of the particles accelerated at a shock front by the
first order Fermi process can be determined within kinetic models that account
for both the hydrodynamics of the shocked fluid and the transport of the
accelerated particles. These models predict the appearance of multiple
solutions, all physically allowed. We discuss here the role of injection in
selecting the real solution, in the framework of a simple phenomenological
recipe, which is a variation of what is sometimes referred to as thermal
leakage. In this context we show that multiple solutions basically disappear
and when they are present they are limited to rather peculiar values of the
parameters. We also provide a quantitative calculation of the efficiency of
particle acceleration at cosmic ray modified shocks and we identify the
fraction of energy which is advected downstream and that of particles escaping
the system from upstream infinity at the maximum momentum. The consequences of
efficient particle acceleration for shock heating are also discussed.",2005-05-17T17:21:33Z
The Vega Debris Disk -- A Surprise from Spitzer,"We present high spatial resolution mid- and far-infrared images of the Vega
debris disk obtained with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS).
The disk is well resolved and its angular size is much larger than found
previously. The radius of the disk is at least 43"" (330 AU), 70""(543 AU), and
105"" (815 AU) in extent at 24, 70 and 160 um, respectively. The disk images are
circular, smooth and without clumpiness at all three wavelengths. The radial
surface brightness profiles imply an inner boundary at a radius of 11""+/-2"" (86
AU). Assuming an amalgam of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains, the
disk can be modeled as an axially symmetric and geometrically thin disk, viewed
face-on, with the surface particle number density following an r^-1 power law.
The disk radiometric properties are consistent with a range of models using
grains of sizes ~1 to ~50 um. We find that a ring, containing grains larger
than 180 um and at radii of 86-200 AU from the star, can reproduce the observed
850 um flux, while its emission does not violate the observed MIPS profiles.
This ring could be associated with a population of larger asteroidal bodies
analogous to our own Kuiper Belt. Cascades of collisions starting with
encounters amongthese large bodies in the ring produce the small debris that is
blown outward by radiation pressure to much larger distances where we detect
its thermal emission. The dust production rate is >~10^15 g/s based on the MIPS
results. This rate would require a very massive asteroidal reservoir for the
dust to be produced in a steady state throughout Vega's life. Instead, we
suggest that the disk we imaged is ephemeral and that we are witnessing the
aftermath of a large and relatively recent collisional event, and subsequent
collisional cascade.",2005-04-04T21:33:42Z
"The loopy UV line profiles of RU Lupi: accretion, outflows, and
  fluorescence","We present far-ultraviolet spectra of the classical T Tauri star RU Lupi
covering the 912-1710 A spectral range, as observed by the HST/STIS and FUSE
satellites. We use these spectra, which are rich in emission and absorption
lines, to probe both the accreting and outflowing gas. Absorption in the
Ly-alpha profile constrains the extinction to A_V=0.07 mag, which we confirm
with other diagnostics. We estimate a mass accretion rate of
(5\pm2)\times10^{-8}$ M_\odot/yr using the optical-NUV accretion continuum. The
accreting gas is also detected in bright, broad lines of C IV, Si IV, and N V,
which all show complex structures across the line profile. Many other emission
lines, including those of H_2 and Fe II, are pumped by Ly-alpha. RU Lupi's
spectrum varies significantly in the FUV; our STIS observations occurred when
RU Lupi was brighter than several other observations in the FUV, possibly due
to a high mass accretion rate.",2005-04-29T04:34:41Z
An Unusual System of HI Filaments near WR 5 and HD 17603,"We report the discovery of a system of unusual HI filaments which appear to
be associated with molecular clouds in the Perseus spiral arm of our Galaxy. We
investigate the hypothesis that this system is the result of a directed flow of
dissociated gas from clouds trapped within an extended wind flow from massive
stars. The Wolf-Rayet star WR 5 and the OIb(f) star HD 17603 are identified as
candidate driving sources. However, an examination of this hypothesis within
the context of the theory of mass-loaded winds shows that these two stars alone
cannot account for the energetics and kinematics of the required spherically
symmetric wind flow. Unless the apparent association between HI, molecular gas,
and stars is an accidental one, we suggest that other as-yet unidentified stars
must have contributed to driving the filaments.",2005-05-18T19:57:00Z
Spectral Synthesis of SDSS Galaxies,"We investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a mean to estimate physical
properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the
decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of
simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities (here from Bruzual
& Charlot 2003), producing as output the star-formation and chemical histories
of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. We discuss the reliability
of this approach and apply it to a volume limited sample of 50362 galaxies from
the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalog of stellar population properties.
A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of
these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative
agreement, despite substantial differences in the method of analysis. The
confidence in the method is further strengthened by several empirical and
astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and
independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong
correlations between stellar and nebular metallicites, stellar and nebular
extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of Halpha and 4000 \AA
break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion. We also present
preliminary results of an analysis of a magnitude-limited sample which clearly
reveals that the bimodality of galaxy populations is present in the parameters
computed in the synthesis. Our results are also consistent with the
""down-sizing"" scenario of galaxy formation and evolution. Finally, we point out
one of the major problems facing spectral synthesis of early-type systems: the
spectral base adopted here is based on solar-scaled evolutionary tracks whose
abundance pattern may not be appropriate for this type of galaxy.",2005-06-17T16:59:06Z
"Wide-Angle Wind Driven Bipolar Outflows: High Resolution Models with
  Application to Source I of the Becklin-Neugebauer / Kleinmann-Low OMC-I
  Region","We carry out high resolution simulations of the inner regions of a wide angle
wind driven bipolar outflow using an Adaptive Mesh Refinement code. Our code
follows H-He gas with molecular, atomic and ionic components and the associated
time dependent molecular chemistry and ionization dynamics with radiative
cooling. Our simulations explore the nature of the outflow when a spherical
wind expands into a rotating, collapsing envelope. We compare with key
observational properties of the outflow system of Source I in the BN/KL region.
  Our calculations show that the wind evacuates a bipolar outflow cavity in the
infalling envelope. We find the head of the outflow to be unstable and that it
rapidly fragments into clumps. We resolve the dynamics of the strong shear
layer which defines the side walls of the cavity. We conjecture that this layer
is the likely site of maser emission and examine its morphology and rotational
properties. The shell of swept up ambient gas that delineates the cavity edge
retains its angular momentum. This rotation is roughly consistent with that
observed in the Source I SiO maser spots. The observed proper motions and
line-of-sight velocity are approximately reproduced by the model. The cavity
shell at the base of the flow assumes an X-shaped morphology which is also
consistent with Source I. We conclude that the wide opening angle of the
outflow is evidence that a wide-angle wind drives the Source I outflow and not
a collimated jet.",2005-06-08T03:46:47Z
Characterizing the Cluster Lens Population,"We present a detailed investigation into which properties of CDM halos make
them effective strong gravitational lenses. Strong lensing cross sections of
878 clusters from an N-body simulation are measured by ray tracing through
13,594 unique projections. We measure concentrations, axis ratios,
orientations, and the amount of substructure of each cluster, and compare the
lensing weighted distribution of each quantity to that of the cluster
population as a whole. The concentrations of lensing clusters are on average
34% larger than the typical cluster in the Universe. Despite this bias, the
anomalously high concentrations (c >14) recently measured by several groups,
appear to be inconsistent with the concentration distribution in our
simulations, which predict < 2% of lensing clusters should have concentrations
this high. No correlation is found between lensing cross section and the amount
of substructure. We introduce several types of simplified dark matter halos,
and use them to isolate which properties of CDM clusters make them effective
lenses. Projections of halo substructure onto small radii and the large scale
mass distribution of clusters do not significantly influence cross sections.
The abundance of giant arcs is primarily determined by the mass distribution
within an average overdensity of ~ 10,000. A multiple lens plane ray tracing
algorithm is used to show that projections of large scale structure increase
the giant arc abundance by a modest amount <7%. We revisit the question of
whether there is an excess of giant arcs behind high redshift clusters in the
RCS survey and find that the number of high redshift (z > 0.6) lenses is in
good agreement with LCDM, although our simulations predict more low redshift (z
< 0.6) lenses than were observed. (abridged)",2005-06-08T14:49:47Z
"An analytic approach to the late ISW effect in a Lambda dominated
  universe","The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in a Lambda dominated universe can be
an important factor in the evolution of cosmic microwave background
fluctuations. With the inclusion of cosmological constant we present the
complete analytic solution of the covariant linear perturbations of the
Einstein equations in the Newtonian gauge, in the case of a spatially flat
(K=0), Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, filled with pressureless ideal
fluid. We use the analytic time dependence of the perturbation potentials to
derive the anisotropy power spectrum of the late ISW effect. We choose the
scale invariant Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum for obtaining the C_l momenta and
show the agreement of our results with earlier, numeric calculations.",2005-03-16T15:34:08Z
Length of inflation and WMAP data in the case of power-law inflation,"The effect of the length of inflation on the power spectra of scalar and
tensor perturbations is estimated using the power-law inflation model with a
scale factor of a(t) = t^q. Considering various pre-inflation models with
radiation-dominated or matter-dominated periods before inflation in combination
with two matching conditions, the power spectrum of curvature perturbations at
large scales is calculated. Comparison of the derived angular power spectrum
with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data reveals a possibility
that the WMAP can be explained by the finite length of inflation model if the
length of inflation is near 60 e-folds and q>200.",2005-06-21T06:07:20Z
"Light and heavy metal abundances in hot central stars of planetary
  nebulae","We present new results from our spectral analyses of very hot central stars
achieved since the last IAU Symposium on planetary nebulae held in Canberra
2001. The analyses are mainly based on UV and far-UV spectroscopy performed
with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer
but also on ground-based observations performed at the Very Large Telescope and
other observatories. We report on temperature, gravity, and abundance
determinations for the CNO elements of hydrogen-rich central stars. In many
hydrogen-deficient central stars (spectral type PG1159) we discovered
particular neon and fluorine lines, which are observed for the very first time
in any astrophysical object. Their analysis strongly confirms the idea that
these stars exhibit intershell matter as a consequence of a late helium-shell
flash.",2005-08-03T15:19:10Z

"Luminosity-dependent evolution of soft X-ray selected AGN: New Chandra
  and XMM-Newton surveys","We present new results on the cosmological evolution of unabsorbed (type-1)
active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected in the soft (0.5-2 keV) X-ray band. From
a variety of ROSAT, XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys we selected a total of ~1000
AGN with an unprecedented spectroscopic and photometric optical/NIR
identification completeness. For the first time we are able to derive reliable
space densities for low-luminosity (Seyfert-type) X-ray sources at cosmological
redshifts. The evolutionary behaviour of AGN shows a strong dependence on X-ray
luminosity: while the space density of high-luminosity AGN reaches a peak
around z~2, similar to that of optically selected QSO, the space density of
low-luminosity AGNs peaks at redshifts below z=1. This confirms previous ROSAT
findings of a luminosity-dependent density evolution. Using a rigorous
treatment of the optical identification completeness we are able to show that
the space density of AGN with X-ray luminosities L_x < 10^45 erg s^-1 declines
significantly towards high redshifts.",2005-06-06T17:38:13Z
OH 12.8-0.9: A New Water-Fountain Source,"We present observational evidence that the OH/IR star OH 12.8-0.9 is the
fourth in a class of objects previously dubbed ""water-fountain"" sources. Using
the Very Long Baseline Array, we produced the first images of the water maser
emission associated with OH 12.8-0.9. We find that the masers are located in
two compact regions with an angular separation of ~109 mas on the sky. The axis
of separation between the two maser regions is at a position angle of 1.5 deg.
East of North with the blue-shifted (-80.5 to -85.5 km/s) masers located to the
North and the red-shifted (-32.0 to -35.5 km/s) masers to the South. In
addition, we find that the blue- and red-shifted masers are distributed along
arc-like structures ~10-12 mas across oriented roughly perpendicular to the
separation axis. The morphology exhibited by the water masers is suggestive of
an axisymmetric wind with the masers tracing bow shocks formed as the wind
impacts the ambient medium. This bipolar jet-like structure is typical of the
three other confirmed water-fountain sources. When combined with the previously
observed spectral characteristics of OH 12.8-0.9, the observed spatio-kinematic
structure of the water masers provides strong evidence that OH 12.8-0.9 is
indeed a member of the water-fountain class.",2005-05-31T19:04:03Z
A Brighter Past: Galaxy Luminosity Function At High Redshifts,"Using the conditional luminosity function -- the luminosity distribution of
galaxies in a dark matter halo as a function of the halo mass -- we present an
empirical model to describe the redshift evolution of the rest B-band galaxy
luminosity function (LF). The model is compared to measured LFs out to a
redshift of 3.5, including LFs of galaxy types separated to red and blue
galaxies. The increase in the number density of luminous galaxies, at the
bright-end of the LF, can be explained as due to a brightening of the
luminosity of galaxies present in dark matter halo centers, relative to the
luminosity of central galaxies in similar mass halos today. The lack of strong
evolution in the faint-end of the LF, however, argues against a model involving
pure luminosity evolution at all halo mass scales. The increase in luminosity
at the bright-end compensates the rapid decline in the number density of
massive halos as the redshift is increased. The decline in group to
cluster-mass dark matter halos out to a redshift of ~ 2 is not important as the
central galaxy luminosity flattens at halo masses around 10^13 M_sun At
redshifts ~ 2 to 3, however, the density of bright galaxies begins to decrease
due to the rapid decline in the number density of dark matter halos at mass
scales around and below 10^13 M_sun. We compare our predictions to the UV LF of
galaxies at redshifts 3 to 6 and the galaxy clustering bias measurements at
redshifts ~ 3, and use our models to establish the dark matter halo mass scales
of galaxies observed at high redshifts. In general, to explain high-redshift
LFs, galaxies in dark matter halos around 10^12 M_sun must increase in
luminosity by a factor of ~ 4 to 6 between today and redshift of 6.",2005-06-04T00:35:50Z
Spectroscopy of twelve Type Ia supernovae at intermediate redshift,"We present spectra of twelve Type Ia supernovae obtained in 1999 at the
William Herschel Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope during a search for
Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) at intermediate redshift. The spectra range from
z=0.178 to z=0.493, including five high signal-to-noise ratio SN Ia spectra in
the still largely unexplored range 0.15 < z < 0.3. Most of the spectra were
obtained before or around restframe B-band maximum light. None of them shows
the peculiar spectral features found in low-redshift over- or under-luminous SN
Ia. Expansion velocities of characteristic spectral absorption features such as
SiII at 6355 angs., SII at 5640 angs. and CaII at 3945 angs. are found
consistent with their low-z SN Ia counterparts.",2005-07-29T14:14:53Z
"The first chemical enrichment in the universe and the formation of hyper
  metal-poor stars","The recent discovery of a hyper metal-poor (HMP) star, whose metallicity Fe/H
is smaller than 1/100,000 of the solar ratio, together with one earlier HMP
star, has raised a challenging question if these HMP stars are the actual first
generation, low mass stars in the Universe. We argue that these HMP stars are
the second generation stars being formed from gases which were chemically
enriched by the first generation supernovae. The key to this solution is the
very unusual abundance patterns of these HMP stars with important similarities
and differences. We can reproduce these abundance features with the
core-collapse ``faint'' supernova models which undergo extensive matter mixing
and fallback during the explosion.",2005-05-26T01:00:10Z
"Constraints on dark matter and the shape of the Milky Way dark halo from
  the 511 keV line","About one year ago, it was speculated that decaying or annihilating Light
Dark Matter (LDM) particles could explain the flux and extension of the 511 keV
line emission in the galactic centre. Here we present a thorough comparison
between theoretical expectations of the galactic positron distribution within
the LDM scenario and observational data from INTEGRAL/SPI. Unlike previous
analyses, there is now enough statistical evidence to put tight constraints on
the shape of the dark matter halo of our galaxy, if the galactic positrons
originate from dark matter. For annihilating candidates, the best fit to the
observed 511 keV emission is provided by a radial density profile with inner
logarithmic slope gamma=1.03+-0.04. In contrast, decaying dark matter requires
a much steeper density profile, gamma>1.5, rather disfavoured by both
observations and numerical simulations. Within the annihilating LDM scenario, a
velocity-independent cross-section would be consistent with the observational
data while a cross-section purely proportional to v^2 can be rejected at a high
confidence level. Assuming the most simplistic model where the galactic
positrons are produced as primaries, we show that the LDM candidate should be a
scalar rather than a spin-1/2 particle and obtain a very stringent constraint
on the value of the positron production cross-section to explain the 511 keV
emission. One consequence is that the value of the fine structure constant
should differ from that recommended in the CODATA. This is a very strong test
for the LDM scenario and an additional motivation in favour of experiments
measuring alpha directly. Our results finally indicate that an accurate
measurement of the shape of the dark halo profile could have a tremendous
impact on the determination of the origin of the 511 keV line and vice versa.",2005-07-06T18:12:58Z
SN 1998A: Explosion of a Blue Supergiant,"We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the peculiar Type II
supernova (SN) 1998A. The light curves and spectra closely resemble those of SN
1987A, suggesting that the SN 1998A progenitor exploded when it was a compact
blue supergiant. However, the comparison with SN 1987A also highlights some
important differences: SN 1998A is more luminous and the spectra show bluer
continua and larger expansion velocities at all epochs. These observational
properties indicate that the explosion of SN 1998A is more energetic than SN
1987A and more typical of SNe II. Comparing the observational data to
simulations, we deduce that the progenitor of SN 1998A was a massive star (~ 25
Mo) with a small pre-supernova radius (< 6 x 10^{12} cm). The Ba II lines,
unusually strong in SN 1987A and some faint II--P events, are almost normal in
the case of SN 1998A, indicating that the temperature plays a key role in
determining their strength.",2005-04-05T16:21:11Z
"Probing The Dust-To-Gas Ratio of z > 0 Galaxies Through Gravitational
  Lenses","We report the detection of differential gas column densities in three
gravitational lenses, MG0414+0534, HE1104-1805, and PKS1830-211. Combined with
the previous differential column density measurements in B1600+434 and
Q2237+0305 and the differential extinction measurements of these lenses, we
probe the dust-to-gas ratio of a small sample of cosmologically distant normal
galaxies. We obtain an average dust-to-gas ratio of E(B-V)/NH =(1.4\pm0.5) e-22
mag cm^2/atoms with an estimated intrinsic dispersion in the ratio of ~40%.
This average dust-to-gas ratio is consistent with the average Galactic value of
1.7e-22 mag cm^2/atoms and the estimated intrinsic dispersion is also
consistent with the 30% observed in the Galaxy.",2005-07-17T20:47:43Z
A new population of very high energy gamma-ray sources in the Milky Way,"Very high energy gamma-rays probe the long-standing mystery of the origin of
cosmic rays. Produced in the interactions of accelerated particles in
astrophysical objects, they can be used to image cosmic particle accelerators.
A first sensitive survey of the inner part of the Milky Way with the High
Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) reveals a population of eight previously
unknown firmly detected sources of very high energy gamma-rays. At least two
have no known radio or X-ray counterpart and may be representative of a new
class of `dark' nucleonic cosmic ray sources.",2005-04-18T09:50:43Z
"Statistical and systematic uncertainties in the event reconstruction and
  S(1000) determination by the Pierre Auger surface detector","We discuss the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the event
reconstruction (core location, and determination of S(1000), i.e., the signal
at a distance of 1000 m from the shower core) by the Pierre Auger surface
detector for showers with zenith angle less than 60 degrees. The method is
based on a maximum likelihood method where the reference lateral distribution
function is obtained through the experimental data. We also discuss S(1000) as
primary energy estimator.",2005-07-01T15:04:52Z
Super-solar Metallicity in the NLS1 Galaxy Markarian 1044,"The determination of the bulk metallicity and the abundance mixture of
various elements is very difficult in quasars and AGNs because only a few lines
are observed and the ionization correction is unknown. Most abundance studies
of AGNs assume the N/C ratio scales as metallicity (nitrogen goes as
metallicity squared) and so serves as a metallicity indicator. We present an
accurate metallicity determination of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy
Markarian 1044, using O VI column density measurements from the Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) together with C IV, N V, and H I from Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations. In this absorption line study we find that
the circumnuclear gas in Mrk 1044 has a metallicity of at least five times
solar. This is consistent with the expectation that NLS1s have a high
metallicity, similar to that found in high-redshift quasars. More surprisingly,
we find that the absorbing material requires a near-solar mixture. In other
words, the N/C is consistent with the solar ratio, and does not scale with the
metallicity. This suggests that the chemical enrichment scenario for this
object, and perhaps for AGNs in general, may be different from the traditional
model of galactic metal enrichment, at least in the high-metallicity regime.",2005-04-06T20:00:02Z
"Stellar evolution with rotation and magnetic fields:III: The interplay
  of circulation and dynamo","We examine the effects of the magnetic field created by the Tayler--Spruit
dynamo in differentially rotating stars. Magnetic fields of the order of a few
$10^4$ G are present through most of the stellar envelope, with the exception
of the outer layers. The diffusion coefficient for the transport of angular
momentum is very large and it imposes nearly solid body rotation during the MS
phase. In turn, solid body rotation drives meridional circulation currents
which are much faster than usual and leads to much larger diffusion
coefficients than the magnetic diffusivity for the chemical species. The
consequence is that the interplay of the thermal and magnetic instabilities
favours the chemical transport of elements, while there would be no transport
in models with magnetic field only. We also discuss the effects on the stellar
interior, lifetimes and HR diagram.",2005-06-15T15:49:01Z
"The Serendipitous XMM-Newton Cluster Athens Survey (SEXCLAS): Sample
  selection and the cluster log N - log S","In this paper we serendipitously identify X-ray cluster candidates using
XMM-Newton archival observations complemented by 5-band optical photometric
follow-up observations (r~23 mag) as part of the X-ray Identification (XID)
programme. Our sample covers an area of ~2.1 sq. deg (15 XMM-Newton fields) and
comprises a total of 21 (19 serendipitous + 2 target) extended X-ray sources to
the limit f(0.5-2keV) ~ 6x10^{-15} cgs with a high probability (> 99.9%) of
being extended on the XMM-Newton images. Of the 21 cluster candidates 7 are
spectroscopically confirmed in the literature. Exploiting the optical data
available for these fields we discover that 68% of the X-ray cluster candidates
are associated with optical galaxy overdensities. We also attempt to constrain
the redshifts of our cluster candidates using photometric methods. We thus
construct the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies in the vicinity of
each X-ray selected cluster candidate and search for statistically significant
redshift peaks against that of the background distribution of field galaxies.
Comparison of the photometric with spectroscopic redshift estimates for the
confirmed clusters suggest that our simple method is robust out to z~0.5. For
clusters at higher z, deeper optical data are required to estimate reliable
photometric redshifts. Finally, using the sample of the 19 serendipitous X-ray
selected cluster candidates we estimate their surface density down to
f(0.5-2keV) ~ 6x10^{-15} cgs and find it to be in fair agreement with previous
and recent studies.",2005-03-18T10:33:36Z
"A Chandra Survey of Early-Type Galaxies, I: Metal Enrichment in the ISM","We present the first in a series of papers studying the X-ray properties of
28 early type galaxies spanning ~3 orders of magnitude in L_x. We report
emission-weighted constraints for Fe, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S and Ni. We find no
evidence of the very sub-solar Z_Fe historically reported, confirming a trend
in recent X-ray observations of bright galaxies and groups, nor do we find Z_Fe
correlates with L_x. In general we find no evidence for multi-phase ISM,
indicating multi-temperature fits found with ASCA were due to temperature
gradients Chandra can resolve. We compare the stellar Z_Fe, estimated from
simple stellar population model fits, to Z_Fe(ISM). Excepting one possible
outlier we find no evidence that the gas is much more metal-poor than the stars
and, in a few systems Z_Fe(ISM) is higher. In general the two exhibit similar
Z_Fe, which is inconsistent with both galactic wind models and recent
hierarchical chemical enrichment simulations. Adopting standard SNIa and SNII
metal yields our abundance ratio constraints imply 66+/-11% of the Fe within
the ISM was produced in SNIa, similar to the Solar neighbourhood and implying
similar enrichment histories for the ISM in a spiral and in elliptical
galaxies. Although these values are sensitive to systematic uncertainties in
the SN yields, they are in good agreement with observations of more massive
systems, indicating remarkable homology in the enrichment process operating
from cluster scales to low-to-intermediate L_x galaxies. The data also
uniformly exhibit the low Z_O/Z_Mg abundance ratios which have been reported in
some other systems. This is inconsistent with metal-production calculations in
SNII and may indicate an additional source of enrichment, such as Population
III hypernovae.(abridged)",2005-04-01T02:29:22Z
"Nitrogen-deficient and iron-rich associated absorbers with oversolar
  metallicities towards the quasar HE0141-3932","HE0141-3932 (zem=1.80) is a bright blue radio-quite quasar which reveals an
emission line spectrum with an unusually weak Ly-alpha line. In addition, large
redshift differences (Delta z=0.05) are observed between high ionization and
low ionization emission lines. Absorption systems identified at z=1.78, 1.71,
and 1.68 show mild oversolar metallicities (Z ~= 1-2Zsolar) and can be
attributed to the associated gas clouds ejected from the circumnuclear region.
The joint analysis of the emission and absorption lines leads to the conclusion
that this quasar is seen almost pole-on. Its apparent luminosity may be Doppler
boosted by ~10 times. The absorbing gas shows high abundance of Fe, Mg, and Al
([Fe, Mg, Al/C] ~= 0.15+/-0.10) along with underabundance of N ([N/C]<=-0.5).
This abundance pattern is at variance with current chemical evolution models of
QSOs predicting [N/C]>0 and [Fe/C]<0 at Z ~ Zsolar. Full details of this work
are given in Reimers et al. (2005).",2005-06-20T08:41:06Z
"Homeoidally striated density profiles: sequences of virial equilibrium
  configurations with constant anisotropy parameters","The formulation of the tensor virial equations is generalized to unrelaxed
configurations, where virial equilibrium does not coincide with dynamical (or
hydrostatic) equilibrium. Further investigation is devoted to special classes
of homeoidally striated ellipsoids, defined as homeoidally striated, Jacobi
ellipsoids. In particular, virial equilibrium configurations with constant
anisotropy parameters are studied with more detail, including both flattened
and elongated, triaxial configurations, and the determination of the related
bifurcation points. The explicit expression of different rotation parameters is
also determined. An application is made to dark matter haloes hosting giant,
galaxies, with regard to assigned initial and final configuration, following
and generalizing to many respects a procedure conceived by Thuan & Gott (1975).
The dependence of the limiting axis ratios, below which no configuration is
allowed for the sequence under consideration, on the change in mass, total
energy, and angular momentum, during the evolution, is illustrated in some
representative situations. The dependence of axis ratios and rotation
parameters on an additional parameter, related to the initial conditions of the
density perturbation, is analysed in connection with a few special cases.
Within the range of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter, inferred from
high-resolution numerical simulations, the shape of dark matter haloes is
mainly decided by the amount of anisotropy in residual velocity distribution.
On the other hand, the contribution of rotation has only a minor effect on the
meridional plane, and no effect on the equatorial plane, as bifurcation points
occur for larger values of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter. To this respect,
dark matter haloes are found to resemble giant elliptical galaxies.",2005-05-14T10:12:45Z
A Measurement of the CMB <EE> Spectrum from the 2003 Flight of BOOMERANG,"We report measurements of the CMB polarization power spectra from the January
2003 Antarctic flight of BOOMERANG. The primary results come from six days of
observation of a patch covering 0.22% of the sky centered near R.A. = 82.5
deg., Dec= -45 deg. The observations were made using four pairs of polarization
sensitive bolometers operating in bands centered at 145 GHz. Using two
independent analysis pipelines, we measure a non-zero <EE> signal in the range
100< l <1000 with a significance 4.8-sigma, a 2-sigma upper limit of 8.6 uK^2
for any <BB> contribution, and a 2-sigma upper limit of 7.0 uK^2 for the <EB>
spectrum. Estimates of foreground intensity fluctuations and the non-detection
of <BB> and <EB> signals rule out any significant contribution from galactic
foregrounds. The results are consistent with a Lambda-CDM cosmology seeded by
adiabatic perturbations. We note that this is the first detection of CMB
polarization with bolometric detectors.",2005-07-21T17:43:21Z
The creation of the Helix planetary nebula (NGC 7293) by multiple events,"A deep, continuum-subtracted, image of NGC 7293 has been obtained in the
light of the Halpha+[N II] emission lines. New images of two filamentary halo
stuctures have been obtained and the possible detection of a collimated outflow
made. Spatially resolved, longslit profiles of the Halpha+[N II] lines have
been observed across several of these features with the MES combined with the
SPM 2.1m telescope; these are compared with the [N II]6584, [O III]5007, HeII
6560 and Halpha profiles obtained over the nebular core. The central HeII
emission is originating in a ~0.34pc diameter spherical volume expanding at
<=12km/s which is surrounded, and partially coincident with an [O III] emitting
inner shell expanding at 12km/s. The bright helical structure surrounding this
inner region is modelled as a bi-polar nebula with lobe expansions of 25km/s
whose axis is tilted at 37deg to the sight line but with a toroidal waist
itself expanding at 14 km/s. These observations are compared with the
expectations of the interacting two winds model for the formation of PNe. Only
after the fast wind has switched off could this global velocity structure be
generated. Ablated flows must complicate any interpretation. It is suggested
that the clumpy nature of much of the material could play a part in creating
the radial `spokes' shown here to be apparently present close to the central
star. These `spokes' could in fact be the persistant tails of cometary globules
whose heads have now photo-evaporated completely. A halo arc projecting from
the north-east of the bright core has a conterpart to the south-east. Anomolies
in the position-velocity arrays of line profiles could suggest that these are
part of an expanding disc not aligned with the central helical structure though
expanding bi-polar lobes along a tilted axis are not ruled out.",2005-04-13T13:47:56Z
Where Are The M Dwarf Disks Older Than 10 Million Years?,"We present 11.7-micron observations of nine late-type dwarfs obtained at the
Keck I 10-meter telescope in December 2002 and April 2003. Our targets were
selected for their youth or apparent IRAS 12-micron excess. For all nine
sources, excess infrared emission is not detected. We find that stellar wind
drag can dominate the circumstellar grain removal and plausibly explain the
dearth of M Dwarf systems older than 10 Myr with currently detected infrared
excesses. We predict M dwarfs possess fractional infrared excess on the order
of L_{IR}/L_{*}\sim10^{-6} and this may be detectable with future efforts.",2005-06-07T07:23:20Z
"A Resonance Model of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations of Low-Mass X-Ray
  Binaries","We try to understand the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in low-mass
neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binaries by a resonance model in warped disks
with precession. Our main concern is high-frequency QPOs, hectohertz QPOs, and
horizontal-branch QPOs in the z sources and the atoll sources, and the
correponding QPOs in black-hole X-ray binaries. Our resonance model can
qualitatively, but systematically, explain these QPOs by regarding hectohertz
QPOs as a precession of warp.",2005-05-11T00:29:55Z
Kink Stability of Isothermal Spherical Self-Similar Flow Revisited,"The problem of kink stability of isothermal spherical self-similar flow in
newtonian gravity is revisited. Using distribution theory we first develop a
general formula of perturbations, linear or non-linear, which consists of three
sets of differential equations, one in each side of the sonic line and the
other along it. By solving the equations along the sonic line we find
explicitly the spectrum, $k$, of the perturbations, whereby we obtain the
stability criterion for the self-similar solutions. When the solutions are
smoothly across the sonic line, our results reduce to those of Ori and Piran.
To show such obtained perturbations can be matched to the ones in the regions
outside the sonic line, we study the linear perturbations in the external
region of the sonic line (the ones in the internal region are identically
zero), by taking the solutions obtained along the line as the boundary
conditions. After properly imposing other boundary conditions at spatial
infinity, we are able to show that linear perturbations, satisfying all the
boundary conditions, exist and do not impose any additional conditions on $k$.
As a result, the complete treatment of perturbations in the whole spacetime
does not alter the spectrum obtained by considering the perturbations only
along the sonic line.",2005-04-20T20:04:16Z
"STIS Spectroscopy of Young Star Clusters in ""The Antennae"" Galaxies (NGC
  4038/4039)","Long-slit spectra of several dozen young star clusters have been obtained at
three positions in the Antennae galaxies with the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS) and its 52""x0.2"" slit. Based on H-alpha emission-line
measurements, the average cluster-to-cluster velocity dispersion in 7 different
cluster aggregates (""knots"") is <10 \kms. The fact that this upper limit is
similar to the velocity dispersion of gas in the disks of typical spiral
galaxies suggests that the triggering mechanism for the formation of young
massive compact clusters (""super star clusters"") is unlikely to be high
velocity cloud-cloud collisions. On the other hand, models where preexisting
giant molecular clouds in the disks of spiral galaxies are triggered into
cluster formation are compatible with the observed low velocity dispersions.
These conclusions are consistent with those reached by Zhang et al. (2001)
based on comparisons between the positions of the clusters and the velocity and
density structure of the nearby interstellar medium. We find evidence for
systematically lower values of the line ratios [NII]/H-alpha and [SII]/H-alpha
in the bright central regions of some of the knots, relative to their outer
regions. This suggests that the harder ionizing photons are used up in the
regions nearest the clusters, and the diffuse ionized gas farther out is
photoionized by 'leakage' of the leftover low-energy photons. The low values of
the [SII]/H-alpha line ratio, typically [SII]/H-alpha<0.4, indicates that the
emission regions are photoionized rather than shock heated. The absence of
evidence for shock-heated gas is an additional indication that high velocity
cloud-cloud collisions are not playing a major role in the formation of the
young clusters.",2005-07-29T15:05:03Z
"An approach toward the successful supernova explosion by physics of
  unstable nuclei","We study the explosion mechanism of collapse-driven supernovae by numerical
simulations with a new nuclear EOS based on unstable nuclei. We report new
results of simulations of general relativistic hydrodynamics together with the
Boltzmann neutrino-transport in spherical symmetry. We adopt the new data set
of relativistic EOS and the conventional set of EOS (Lattimer-Swesty EOS) to
examine the influence on dynamics of core-collapse, bounce and shock
propagation. We follow the behavior of stalled shock more than 500 ms after the
bounce and compare the evolutions of supernova core.",2005-06-25T02:56:33Z
Scalelengths in Dark Matter Halos,"We investigate a hypothesis regarding the origin of the scalelength in halos
formed in cosmological N-body simulations. This hypothesis can be viewed as an
extension of an earlier idea put forth by Merritt and Aguilar. Our findings
suggest that a phenomenon related to the radial orbit instability is present in
such halos and is responsible for density profile shapes. This instability sets
a scalelength at which the velocity dispersion distribution changes rapidly
from isotropic to radially anisotropic. This scalelength is reflected in the
density distribution as the radius at which the density profile changes slope.
We have tested the idea that radially dependent velocity dispersion anisotropy
leads to a break in density profile shape by manipulating the input of a
semi-analytic model to imitate the velocity structure imposed by the radial
orbit instability. Without such manipulation, halos formed are approximated by
single power-law density profiles and isotropic velocity distributions. Halos
formed with altered inputs display density distributions featuring scalelengths
and anisotropy profiles similar to those seen in cosmological N-body
simulations.",2005-08-05T15:39:27Z
"Towards a physical model of dust tori in Active Galactic Nuclei -
  Radiative transfer calculations for a hydrostatic torus model","We explore physically self-consistent models of dusty molecular tori in
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the goal of interpreting VLTI observations
and fitting high resolution mid-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The
input dust distribution is analytically calculated by assuming hydrostatic
equilibrium between pressure forces - due to the turbulent motion of the gas
clouds - and gravitational and centrifugal forces as a result of the
contribution of the nuclear stellar distribution and the central black hole.
For a fully three-dimensional treatment of the radiative transfer problem
through the tori we employ the Monte Carlo code MC3D. We find that in
homogeneous dust distributions the observed mid-infrared emission is dominated
by the inner funnel of the torus, even when observing along the equatorial
plane. Therefore, the stratification of the distribution of dust grains - both
in terms of size and composition - cannot be neglected. In the current study we
only include the effect of different sublimation radii which significantly
alters the SED in comparison to models that assume an average dust grain
property with a common sublimation radius, and suppresses the silicate emission
feature at 9.7 micron. In this way we are able to fit the mean SED of both type
I and type II AGN very well. Our fit of special objects for which high angular
resolution observations (less than 0.3 arcseconds) are available indicates that
the hottest dust in NGC 1068 reaches the sublimation temperature while the
maximum dust temperature in the low-luminosity AGN Circinus falls short of 1000
K.",2005-04-05T12:23:04Z
Diffuse polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster,"We report on full-polarization radio observations of the Perseus cluster
(Abell 426) using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at
wavelengths from 81-95 cm. We have employed a novel technique, Rotation Measure
synthesis (Brentjens and de Bruyn, 2005) to unravel the polarization properties
of the emission across the full field of view and detect polarized emission
over a wide range of RM from about 0 to 90 rad m^-2. The low RM emission is
associated with our Galaxy, while the high RM emission is associated with the
Perseus cluster. The latter reaches typical surface brightness levels of 0.5-1
mJy per beam and must be rather highly polarized. Most of the peripheral
polarized emission appears too bright, by about 1-2 orders of magnitude, to be
explainable as Thomson scattered emission of the central radio source off the
thermal electrons in the cluster. The bulk of the emission associated with the
Perseus cluster is probably related to buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma,
probably relics from still active or now dormant AGN within the cluster. A
lenticular shaped structure measuring 0.5-1 Mpc is strikingly similar to the
structures predicted by Ensslin et al. (1998). At the western edge of the
cluster, we detect very long, linear structures that may be related to shocks
caused by infall of gas into the Perseus cluster.",2005-07-14T15:14:41Z
All Coronal Loops are the Same: Evidence to the Contrary,"The 1998 April 20 spectral line data from the Coronal Diagnostics
Spectrometer (CDS) on the {\it Solar and Heliospheric Observatory} (\SOHO)
shows a coronal loop on the solar limb. Our original analysis of these data
showed that the plasma was multi-thermal, both along the length of the loop and
along the line of sight. However, more recent results by other authors indicate
that background subtraction might change these conclusions, so we consider the
effect of background subtraction on our analysis. We show Emission Measure (EM)
Loci plots of three representative pixels: loop apex, upper leg, and lower leg.
Comparisons of the original and background-subtracted intensities show that the
EM Loci are more tightly clustered after background subtraction, but that the
plasma is still not well represented by an isothermal model. Our results taken
together with those of other authors indicate that a variety of temperature
structures may be present within loops.",2005-05-30T17:54:34Z
Development of Kolmogorov spectrum in the pulsar radio emission,"It is shown that the scattering of electromagnetic waves by Langmuir ones
taking into the account the electric drift motion of particles, is the most
intense nonlinear process and should be responsible for the formation of
radiation spectrum of radio pulsars. Performed analysis indicates that in the
case of existence of inertial interval formation of stationary spectra is
possible. Analysis of linear mechanisms of wave generation and silk allows to
conclude that only possible stationary solution has spectral index $\alpha
=-1.5$. Obtained spectrum is in good agreement with observational data.",2005-05-12T14:07:16Z
"Axisymmetric collapse simulations of rotating massive stellar cores in
  full general relativity: Numerical study for prompt black hole formation","We perform axisymmetric simulations for gravitational collapse of a massive
iron core to a black hole in full general relativity. The iron cores are
modeled by $\Gamma = 4/3$ equilibrium polytrope for simplicity and a parametric
equation of state is adopted during the collapse. Performing simulations for a
wide variety of initial conditions changing the mass, the angular momentum, the
rotational velocity profile of the core, and the parameters of the equations of
state (which are chosen so that the maximum mass of the cold spherical
polytrope is $\approx 1.6M_{\odot}$), a criterion for the prompt black hole
formation is clarified in terms of them. It is found that (i) with the increase
of the thermal energy generated by shocks, the threshold mass for the prompt
black hole formation is increased by 20--40%, (ii) the rotational centrifugal
force increases the threshold mass by $\alt 25%$, (iii) with the increase of
the degree of differential rotation, the threshold mass is also increased, and
(iv) the amplification factors shown in the results (i)--(iii) depend
sensitively on the equation of state. We also find that the collapse dynamics
and the structure of the shock formed at the bounce depend strongly on the
stiffness of the adopted equation of state. In particular, as a new feature, a
strong bipolar explosion is observed for the collapse of rapidly rotating iron
cores with an equation of state which is stiff in subnuclear density and soft
in supranuclear density. Gravitational waves are computed in terms of a
quadrupole formula. It is also found that the waveform depends sensitively on
the equations of state.",2005-04-26T07:23:10Z
The Dipole Anisotropy of the 2 Micron All-Sky Redshift Survey,"We estimate the acceleration on the Local Group (LG) from the Two Micron All
Sky Redshift Survey (2MRS). The sample used includes about 23,200 galaxies with
extinction corrected magnitudes brighter than K_s=11.25 and it allows us to
calculate the flux weighted dipole. The near-infrared flux weighted dipoles are
very robust because they closely approximate a mass weighted dipole, bypassing
the effects of redshift distortions and require no preferred reference frame.
This is combined with the redshift information to determine the change in
dipole with distance. The misalignment angle between the LG and the CMB dipole
drops to 12 degrees at around 50 Mpc/h, but then increases at larger distances,
reaching 21 degrees at around 130 Mpc/h. Exclusion of the galaxies Maffei 1,
Maffei 2, Dwingeloo 1, IC342 and M87 brings the resultant flux dipole to 14
degrees away from the CMB velocity dipole In both cases, the dipole seemingly
converges by 60 Mpc/h. Assuming convergence, the comparison of the 2MRS flux
dipole and the CMB dipole provides a value for the combination of the mass
density and luminosity bias parameters Omega_m^0.6/b_L=0.40+/-0.09.",2005-07-07T11:17:30Z
"On the nature of two low M-dot X-ray bursters: 1RXS J170854.4-321857 and
  1RXS J171824.2-402934","We carried out Chandra observations of two low-luminosity low-mass X-ray
binaries, 1RXS J170854.4-321857 and 1RXS J171824.2-402934, for which previously
single X-ray bursts had been detected with the Wide Field Cameras (WFCs) on
board BeppoSAX. Both were detected in our Chandra observations in an actively
accreting state three to eight years after the X-ray bursts, with 0.5-10 keV
luminosities between 5x10^34 and 2x10^36 erg/s. The apparently persistent
nature is remarkable for 1RXS J171824.2-402934 given its low luminosity of
0.001L_Edd. The persistence of both sources also distinguishes them from 5
other low-L bursters, which have also been seen during bursts with the WFCs but
were not detected during Chandra observations above a luminosity of 10^33
erg/s. Those are probably transient rather than persistent sources.",2005-05-25T16:33:53Z
"The Transit Light Curve Project. IV. Five Transits of the Exoplanet
  OGLE-TR-10b","We present I and B photometry of five distinct transits of the exoplanet
OGLE-TR-10b. By modeling the light curves, we find the planetary radius to be
R_P = 1.06 +/- 0.08 R_Jup and the stellar radius to be R_S = 1.10 +/- 0.07
R_sun. The uncertainties are dominated by statistical errors in the photometry.
Our estimate of the planetary radius is smaller than previous estimates that
were based on lower-precision photometry, and hence the planet is not as
anomalously large as was previously thought. We provide updated determinations
of all the system parameters, including the transit ephemerides.",2005-06-24T13:47:39Z
"Cosmic gamma-ray background from Type Ia supernovae revisited: Evidence
  for missing gamma-rays at MeV","The observed cosmic gamma-ray background at ~ MeV has often been attributed
to Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). Since SNIa is close to a standard candle, one can
calculate the gamma-ray intensity of SNIa integrated over redshifts fairly
accurately, once the evolution of the SNIa rate is known. The latest SNIa rate
measured at z < ~1.6 (Dahlen et al. 2004) indicates that the previous
calculations of the gamma-ray background consistently overestimated the SNIa
rate. With the new rate, we find that the SNIa contribution is an order of
magnitude smaller than observed, and thus new population(s) of sources should
be invoked.",2005-06-06T20:20:19Z
Magnetars,"P-stars are compact stars made of up and down quarks in beta-equilibrium with
electrons in a chromomagnetic condensate. P-stars are able to account for
compact stars like RXJ 1856.5-3754 and RXJ 0720.4-3125, stars with radius
comparable with canonical neutron stars, as well as super massive compact
objects like SgrA*. We discuss p-stars endowed with super strong dipolar
magnetic field which, following consolidated tradition in literature, are
referred to as magnetars. We show that soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous
X-ray pulsars can be understood within our theory. We find a well defined
criterion to distinguish rotation powered pulsars from magnetic powered
pulsars. We show that glitches, that in our magnetars are triggered by magnetic
dissipative effects in the inner core, explain both the quiescent emission and
bursts in soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars. We are able to
account for the braking glitch from SGR 1900+14 and the normal glitch from AXP
1E 2259+586 following a giant burst. We discuss and explain the observed anti
correlation between hardness ratio and intensity. Within our magnetar theory we
are able to account quantitatively for light curves for both gamma-ray
repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars. In particular we explain the puzzling
light curve after the June 18, 2002 giant burst from AXP 1E 2259+586, so that
we feel this last event as the Rosetta Stone for our theory. Finally, in
Appendix we discuss the origin of the soft emission not only for soft gamma-ray
repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars, but also for isolated X-ray pulsars. We
also offer an explanation for the puzzling spectral features in 1E 1207.4-5209.",2005-04-01T12:46:32Z
High-Resolution Spectroscopy of Ursa Major Moving Group Stars,"We use new and extant literature spectroscopy to address abundances and
membership for UMa moving group stars. We first compare the UMa, Coma, and
Hyades H-R diagrams via a homogeneous set of isochrones, and find that these
three aggregates are essentially coeval. Our spectroscopy of cool UMa dwarfs
reveals striking abundance anomalies--trends with Teff, ionization state, and
excitation potential--like those recently seen in young cool M34, Pleaides, and
Hyades dwarfs. In particular, the trend of rising 7774 Ang-based OI abundance
with declining Teff is markedly subdued in UMa compared to the Pleiades,
suggesting a dependence on age or metallicity. Despite disparate sources of Li
data,our homogeneous analysis indicates that UMa members evince remarkably
small scatter in the Li-Teff plane for Teff>5200 K. Significant star-to-star
scatter suggested by previous studies is seen for cooler stars. Comparison with
the consistently determined Hyades Li-Teff trend reveals differences
qualitatively consistent with this cluster's larger [Fe/H] (and perhaps
slightly larger age). However, quantitative comparison with standard stellar
models indicates the differences are smaller than expected, suggesting the
action of a fourth parameter beyond age, mass, and [Fe/H] controlling Li
depletion.",2005-07-29T19:58:47Z
Observing the Seyfert 2 nucleus of NGC 1068 with the VLT Interferometer,"Dusty tori have been suggested to play a crucial role in determining the
physical characteristics of active galactic nuclei (AGN), but investigation of
their properties has stalled for lack of high resolution mid-IR imaging.
Recently, a long-awaited breakthrough in this field was achieved: NGC 1068, a
nearby AGN, was the first extragalactic object to be observed with a mid-IR
interferometer, thereby obtaining the needed angular resolution to study the
alleged torus.
  In this proceeding, first the field of AGN research is briefly reviewed, with
an emphasis on models of dusty tori. Second, the general properties of the key
object NGC 1068 are discussed. Third, the MIDI mid-IR interferometric data set
is presented together with a first attempt to interpret this data in the
context of tori models. Fourth, preliminary MIDI interferometric spectra of the
nucleus of the nearby starbursting galaxy Circinus are presented. Finally, we
briefly discuss the prospects of ESA's Darwin mission for observing nearby and
distant AGN. This mission will allow detailed mapping of tori of low luminosity
AGN such as NGC 1068 up to redshifts of 1 - 2 and more luminous AGN up to
redshift of 10 and beyond (abridged).",2005-07-10T18:38:57Z
"Vertical modes of two-dimensional dust coulomb clusters in complex
  plasmas","The vertical as well as horizontal oscillation modes in a thermally excited
two-dimensional (2D) dust coulomb cluster were investigated for particle
numbers between and using both a box_tree simulation and an analytical method.
The horizontal mode spectra is shown to agree with published results while the
vertical mode spectra obtained from the box_tree simulation and the analytical
method are shown to agree with one another. The maximum frequency of the
vertical modes is shown to be the vertical oscillation frequency of the whole
system acting as a solid plane and the frequency is shown to decrease as the
mode number l decreases. The oscillation patterns of the vertical modes are
also investigated. For clusters with large numbers of particles, the high
frequency modes are shown to have oscillation patterns similar in shape to
Bessel-Fourier functions with various index m and n. For specified values of n,
modes with higher m (except for) have lower frequencies and for specified m,
modes with higher n have lower frequencies. For low frequency modes, the
largest amplitude particle motion is concentrated in a few inner rings with the
outer rings remaining almost motionless. This is in contrast to the horizontal
modes where the strongest motion of the particles is concentrated in the inner
rings at high frequency. For clusters with small numbers of particles (), these
modes where the strongest vertical motion is concentrated in the inner rings
does not exist resulting in oscillation magnitudes for all the modes appearing
in the shape of Bessel-Fourier functions.",2005-07-11T16:51:13Z
"Magnetic field in Cepheus A as deduced from OH maser polarimetric
  observations","We present the results of MERLIN polarization mapping of OH masers at 1665
and 1667 MHz towards the Cepheus A star-forming region. The maser emission is
spread over a region of 6 arcsec by 10 arcsec, twice the extent previously
detected. In contrast to the 22 GHz water masers, the OH masers associated with
H II regions show neither clear velocity gradients nor regular structures. We
identified ten Zeeman pairs which imply a magnetic field strength along the
line-of-sight from -17.3 to +12.7 mG. The magnetic field is organised on the
arcsecond scale, pointing towards us in the west and away from us in the east
side. The linearly polarized components, detected for the first time, show
regularities in the polarization position angles depending on their position.
The electric vectors of OH masers observed towards the outer parts of H II
regions are consistent with the interstellar magnetic field orientation, while
those seen towards the centres of H II regions are parallel to the radio-jets.
A Zeeman quartet inside a southern H II region has now been monitored for 25
years; we confirm that the magnetic field decays monotonically over that
period.",2005-05-18T12:55:31Z
Oxygen-rich disk in the V778 Cyg system resolved,"Various scenarios have been proposed to explain the presence of silicate
features associated with carbon stars, such as V778 Cyg. We have attempted to
constrain these theories by means of mapping water maser mission from V778 Cyg.
The 22 GHz water maser emission from this star has been mapped using MERLIN
with an astrometric accuracy of 25 mas. The spatially- and
kinematically-resolved maser complex is displaced by about 190 mas from the
position of the C-star as measured 10 years earlier using Tycho. Our
simulations and analysis of available data show that this position difference
is unlikely to be due to proper motion if V778 Cyg is at the assumed distance
of 1.4 kpc. The maser components seem to form a distorted S-shaped structure
extended over 18 mas with a clear velocity gradient. We propose a model which
explains the observed water maser structure as an O-rich warped disk around a
companion of the C-star in V 778 binary system, which is seen almost edge-on.
Analysis of observational data, especially those obtained with MERLIN, suggests
that V778 Cyg (and, by implication, other silicate carbon stars) are binary
systems composed of a C-rich star and a companion which stores circumstellar
O-rich material.",2005-04-15T16:21:47Z
Mass Estimates for Some of the Binary Lenses in OGLE III Database,"We model binary microlensing events OGLE 2003-BLG-170, 267, and 291. Source
angular sizes are measured for the events 267 and 291. Model fits to the light
curves give parallaxes for the events 267 and 291, and relative source sizes
for 170 and 267. Selfconsistency arguments provide extra limits on the models
of the event 291. As a result we obtain likelihood estimate of the lens mass
for the event 170, mass measurement based on angular size and parallax for 267,
and narrow limits on mass in the case of 291. Brown dwarfs are most likely
candidates for some of the lens components. The influence of the binary lens
rotation and the Earth parallax may be important but hard to distinguish when
modeling relatively short lasting binary lens events.",2005-07-15T13:52:35Z
"Development of Bubble Chambers With Enhanced Stability and Sensitivity
  to Low-Energy Nuclear Recoils","The viability of using a Bubble Chamber for rare event searches and in
particular for the detection of dark matter particle candidates is considered.
Techniques leading to the deactivation of inhomogeneous nucleation centers and
subsequent enhanced stability in such a detector are described. Results from
prototype trials indicate that sensitivity to low-energy nuclear recoils like
those expected from Weakly Interacting Massive Particles can be obtained in
conditions of near total insensitivity to minimum ionizing backgrounds. An
understanding of the response of superheated heavy refrigerants to these
recoils is demonstrated within the context of existing theoretical models. We
comment on the prospects for the detection of supersymmetric dark matter
particles with a large $CF_{3}I$ chamber.",2005-03-17T20:04:31Z
"Separating C-stars from Dust in the Central Region of the Seyfert 2
  Galaxy NGC 1241","The Sy 2 galaxy NGC 1241 presents a 1.5 kpc large circumnuclear ring of star
formation (CNR) embracing a small bar plus leading arms. Those structures are P
alpha emitters, but barely seen in H alpha. It presents also stellar trailing
arms inside the CNR. GEMINI and HST imagery allow the construction of high
resolution (V-H) and (J-K_s) color maps as well as a (J-K_s) vs. K
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of this complex region. The CNR is heavily
obscured in V, but a fairly transparent window appears in the direction of the
nucleus. Nonetheless, the nucleus presents a (J-K_s) color that is redder than
the CNR. The CNR is composed of extremely young HII regions still enshrouded in
their dust cocoons. However, the nuclear (J-K_s) color can not be explained in
this manner. Therefore, we propose the contribution of C-Stars as the most
feasible mechanism for explaining the colors. If the nuclear stellar population
is comparable to that of the LMC bar, 500 C-stars and 25000 AGB O-rich stars
inside 50 pc may reproduce the observed colors. C-Stars release enriched
material to the nuclear environment, probably fueling the central engine of
this Sy 2 galaxy during the lifetime of stars with masses between 2 M_sun <
M_C-star < 6 M_sun (C-star phase). The ejected material that remains trapped in
the central potential might also explain the systematically observed increased
strength of the optical CN-bands in Sy 2 galaxies and is consistent with the
significant contribution of intermediate age stars to the optical continuum of
low luminosity AGNs.",2005-06-20T13:01:32Z
"X-ray synchrotron emission from the oblique shock in the jet of the
  powerful radio galaxy 3C 346","We report the first detection, with Chandra, of X-ray emission from the jet
of the powerful narrow-line radio galaxy 3C 346. X-rays are detected from the
bright radio and optical knot at which the jet apparently bends by about 70
degrees. The Chandra observation also reveals a bright galaxy-scale atmosphere
within the previously-known cluster, and provides a good X-ray spectrum for the
bright core of 3C 346. The X-ray emission from the knot is synchrotron
radiation, as seen in lower-power sources. In common with these sources, there
is evidence of morphological differences between the radio/optical and X-ray
structures, and the spectrum is inconsistent with a one-component
continuous-injection model. We suggest that the X-ray-bright knot is associated
with a strong oblique shock in a moderately relativistic, light jet, at about
20 degrees to the line of sight, and that this shock is caused by the jet
interacting with the wake in the cluster medium behind 3C 346's companion
galaxy. The general jet curvature can result from pressure gradients in the
cluster atmosphere.",2005-04-06T09:21:10Z
"The Local Group Census: searching for PNe in IC 1613, WLM and GR8","In the framework of the Local Group Census (LGC), a survey of the Local Group
(LG) galaxies above Dec=$-30^\circ$, which is aimed at surveying their
populations with strong emission lines, we have searched for planetary nebulae
(PNe) in the low-metallicity dwarf irregular galaxies IC1613, WLM, GR8. Two new
candidate PNe have been found in IC1613, one in WLM and none in GR8. The
observations presented in this paper, together with the previous results from
the LGC, represent the first step in the study of the PN population in
low-metallicity, dwarf irregular galaxies of the Local Group. They will be
followed by deep spectroscopy to confirm their nature and to study their
physical-chemical properties. We used the observed number of PNe in each LG
galaxy to estimate a lower limit to the mass of the intermediate-age population
which was compared to the Star Formation Rate (SFR) of LG dwarf galaxies. These
results are in agreement with those from accurate star formation history (SFH)
analysis for these small galaxy systems.",2005-05-17T09:56:00Z
"Star formation rate density and the stochastic background of
  gravitational waves","There is in the literature a number of papers addressing the stochastic
background of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by an ensemble of
astrophysical sources. The main ingredient in such studies is the so called
star formation rate density (SFRD), which gives the density of stars formed per
unit time. Some authors argue, however, that there is, in the equation that
determines the amplitude of the stochastic background of GWs, an additional
(1+z) term dividing the SFRD, which would account for the effect of cosmic
expansion onto the time variable. We argue here that the inclusion of this
additional term is wrong. In order to clarify where the inclusion of the (1+z)
term is really necessary, we briefly discuss the calculation of event rates in
the study of GRBs (gamma ray bursts) from cosmological origin.",2005-07-01T13:45:08Z
"A Comparison of Stellar and Gaseous Kinematics in the Nuclei of Active
  Galaxies","To investigate the relationship between black holes and their host galaxies,
many groups have used the width of the [O III] 5007 line as a substitute for
the stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*) of galaxy bulges. We directly test
this assumption with a large and homogeneous sample of narrow-line active
galactic nuclei from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We consider multiple
transitions ([O II] 3727, [O III] 5007, and [S II] 6716, 6731) and various
techniques for quantifying the line width in order to obtain a calibration
between the gas velocity dispersion, sigma_g, and sigma*. We find that sigma_g
of the low-ionization lines traces sigma*, as does sigma_g for the core of [O
III] after its asymmetric blue wing is properly removed, although in all cases
the correlation between sigma_g and sigma* has considerable scatter. While the
gas kinematics of the narrow-line region of active galaxies are primarily
governed by the gravitational potential of the stars, the accretion rate, as
traced by the Eddington luminosity ratio, seems to play an important secondary
role. Departures from virial motions correlate systematically with accretion
rate. We discuss the implications of these results for previous studies that
use [O III] line widths to infer stellar velocity dispersions in quasars and
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies.",2005-03-30T21:02:32Z
The Molecular Accretion Flow in G10.6-0.4,"We have observed the ultracompact HII region G10.6-0.4 with the VLA in 23 GHz
continuum and the NH3(3,3) inversion line. By analyzing the optical depth of
the line as well as the kinematics, we have detected a flattened, rotating,
molecular accretion flow. We detect the fact that the highest column density
gas is more flattened, that is, distributed more narrowly, than the lower
column density gas, and that there is some inclination of the rotation axis.
The rotation is sub-Keplerian, and the molecular gas is not in a rotationally
supported disk. We do not find a single massive (proto)star forming in a scaled
up version of low mass star formation. Instead, our observations suggest a
different mode of clustered massive star formation, in which the accretion flow
flattens but does not form an accretion disk. Also in this mode of star
formation the central object can be a group of massive stars rather than a
single massive star.",2005-06-02T13:30:40Z
"Observations Supporting the Existence of an Intrinsic Magnetic Moment
  Inside the Central Compact Object Within the Quasar Q0957+561","Recent auto-correlation and fluctuation analysis of time series data in the
brightness curves and micro-lensing size scales seen in Q0957+561 A,B has
produced important information about the existence and characteristic physical
dimensions of a new non-standard internal structure contained within this
quasar. We find that the new internal quasar structure, which we shall call the
Schild-Vakulik Structure, can be consistently explained in terms of a new class
of gravitationally collapsing solutions to the Einstein field equations which
describe highly redshifted, Eddington limited, Magnetospheric Eternally
Collapsing Objects (MECO) that contain intrinsic magnetic moments. Since
observation of the Schild-Vakulik structure within Q0957+561 implies that this
quasar contains an observable intrinsic magnetic moment, this represents strong
evidence that this quasar does not have an event horizon",2005-05-25T17:37:09Z
GRB Variability-Luminosity Correlation Confirmed,"Recently, Guidorzi et al. (2005) expanded the size of the sample of GRBs for
which variabilities and peak luminosities have been measured, from 11 to 32.
They confirm the existence of a correlation, but find a dramatically different
relationship between L and V than had originally been found. We find that this
is the result of improper statistical methodology. When we fit a model to the
data that accommodates both statistical variance (in two dimensions) and sample
variance, we find that L ~ V^3.4(+0.9,-0.6) with a sample variance of
sigma_logV = 0.20(+0.04,-0.04), which is consistent with the original finding
of Reichart et al. (2001) -- L ~ V^3.3(+1.1,-0.9) with a sample variance of
sigma_logV = 0.18(+0.07,-0.05) -- and inconsistent with the finding of Guidorzi
et al. (2005): L ~ V^1.3(+0.8,-0.4) with sample variance assumed to be zero.",2005-08-03T16:07:50Z
"Spectral Indications of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in Archeops
  and WMAP Data","In this paper, we present a joint cross-correlation analysis of the Archeops
CMB maps at 143 and 217 GHz and the WMAP CMB maps at 41, 61 and 94 GHz with sky
templates of projected galaxy density constructed from the 2MASS Extended
Source catalog. These templates have been divided in patches sorted in
decreasing galaxy density with a fixed number of pixels (we considered patches
having 32, 64 and 128 pixels) and the cross correlation has been performed
independently for each of these patches. We find that the densest patch shows a
strong temperature decrement in the Q, V, W bands of WMAP and in the 143 GHz
channel of Archeops, but not in the 217 GHz channel. Furthermore, we find that
the spectral behavior of the amplitude of this decrement is compatible with
that expected for the non-relativistic thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and
is incompatible (at 4.5 sigma level) with the null hypothesis of having only
CMB, noise and a dust component (nu^2) in those pixels. We find that the first
32-pixel sized patch samples the cores of 11 known massive nearby galaxy
clusters. Under the assumption that the decrement found in this patch is due
entirely to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, we obtain an average
comptonization parameter for those sources of y = (0.41 +- 0.08) x 10^(-4) at
13 arcmin angular scales. This value is compatible at 1 sigma with the
expectation, y = 0.49 x 10^(-4), from a model of the cluster flux number counts
based on the standard Lambda-CDM cosmology. The observed value of y is slightly
diluted when computed for the first patch of 64 and 128 pixels, presumably due
to the inclusion of less massive clusters, and the dilution factor inferred is
also compatible with the quoted model.",2005-06-22T10:10:11Z
"Chandra observations of the millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 in
  quiescence","In this Paper we report on our analysis of three Chandra observations of the
accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 obtained during the
late stages of the 2004 outburst. We also report the serendipitous detection of
the source in quiescence by ROSAT during MJD 48830-48839. The detected 0.3-10
keV source count rates varied significantly between the Chandra observations
from (7.2+-1.2)x10^-3, (6.8+-0.9)x10^-3, and (1.4+-0.1)x10^-2 counts per second
for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Chandra observation, on MJD 53371.88, 53383.99, and
53407.57, respectively. The count rate for the 3rd observation is 2.0+-0.4
times as high as that of the average of the first two observations. The
unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV source flux for the best-fit power-law model to the
source spectrum was (7.9+-2.5)x10^-14, (7.3+-2.0)x10^-14, and
(1.17+-0.22)x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Chandra
observation, respectively. We find that this source flux is consistent with
that found by ROSAT [~(5.4+-2.4)x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1]. Under the assumption
that the interstellar extinction, N_H, does not vary between the observations,
we find that the blackbody temperature during the 2nd Chandra observation is
significantly higher than that during the 1st and 3rd observation. Furthermore,
the effective temperature of the neutron star derived from fitting an absorbed
blackbody or neutron star atmosphere model to the data is rather high in
comparison with many other neutron star soft X-ray transients in quiescence,
even during the 1st and 3rd observation. If we assume that the source quiescent
luminosity is similar to that measured for two other accretion powered
millisecond pulsars in quiescence, the distance to IGR J00291+5934 is 2.6-3.6
kpc.",2005-05-06T10:44:14Z
"Search for Cross-Correlations of Ultra--High-Energy Cosmic Rays with BL
  Lacertae Objects","Data taken in stereo mode by the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) air
fluorescence experiment are analyzed to search for correlations between the
arrival directions of ultra--high-energy cosmic rays with the positions of BL
Lacertae objects. Several previous claims of significant correlations between
BL Lacs and cosmic rays observed by other experiments are tested. These claims
are not supported by the HiRes data. However, we verify a recent analysis of
correlations between HiRes events and a subset of confirmed BL Lacs from the
10th Veron Catalog, and we study this correlation in detail. Due to the a
posteriori nature of the search, the significance level cannot be reliably
estimated and the correlation must be tested independently before any claim can
be made. We identify the precise hypotheses that will be tested with
statistically independent data.",2005-07-06T04:22:51Z
"Cross-Correlation Lensing: Determining Galaxy and Cluster Mass Profiles
  from Statistical Weak Lensing Measurements","We present a new non-parametric method for determining mean 3D density and
mass profiles from weak lensing measurements around stacked samples of galaxies
or clusters, that is, from measurement of the galaxy-shear or cluster-shear
correlation functions. Since the correlation function is statistically
isotropic, this method evades problems, such as projection of large-scale
structure along the line of sight or halo asphericity, that complicate attempts
to infer masses from weak lensing measurements of individual objects. We
demonstrate the utility of this method in measuring halo profiles, galaxy-mass
and cluster-mass cross-correlation functions, and cluster virial masses. We
test this method on an N-body simulation and show that it correctly and
accurately recovers the 3D density and mass profiles of halos. We find no
evidence of problems due to a mass sheet degeneracy in the simulation.
Cross-correlation lensing provides a powerful method for calibrating the
mass-observable relation for use in measurement of the cluster mass function in
large surveys. It can also be used on large scales to measure and remove the
halo bias and thereby provide a direct measurement of Omega_m * sigma_8.",2005-07-20T18:28:50Z
"Can the rotation of the dark matter halo of our galaxy be detected
  through its effect on the cosmic microwave background polarisation?","The proposition that dark matter halos possess angular momentum, though
widely accepted, is a theoretical prediction which has, till date, not been
observationally verified. The gravi-magnetic field produced by a rotating
gravitating object is possibly the only direct consequence of the angular
momentum of dark matter halos. The gravitational Faraday rotation produced by
the dark matter halo of our galaxy is present in all astronomical observations.
A detection of the imprint of this effect on the all-sky cosmic microwave
background radiation polarisation pattern would directly probe the angular
momentum of the dark matter halo of our Galaxy. We have calculated the expected
gravitational Faraday rotation which turns out to be a $(v_c/c)^3$ effect,
$v_c$ being the rotational speed of our halo. The predicted gravitational
Faraday effect rotation angles are less than $1^{''}$, implying that this
effect, though present, is too small to be detected.",2005-06-01T08:19:12Z
The Effects of Clumping on Derived Abundances in H II Regions,"We have compared Monte Carlo photoionization models of H II regions with a
uniform density distribution with models with the same central stars and
chemical compositions but with 3-D hierarchical clumps. We compare the
abundances of He, N, O, Ne, and S obtained from emission line strengths and [O
III] and [N II] temperatures to those in our models. We consider stellar
temperatures in the range 37.5 -- 45kK and ionizing luminosities from 10^{48}
to 10^{51} photons/s.
  Clumped models have different ionic abundances than uniform. For hot stars,
He^0/He^+ is 2 -- 3%, much larger than with uniform models. This amount of He I
is independent of metallicity and so impacts the determination of the
primordial abundance of He. The total abundances of O, Ne, and S obtained by
the usual methods of analysis, using T([OIII) for high stages of ionization and
T([NII]) for low, are about as accurate for clumped models as for uniform and
within about 20% of the true values. If T([OIII]) is used for analyzing all
ions, the derived (O/H) is 40 to 60% too large for cool stars but is good for
hot stars. Uniform models have similar errors, so the clumping does not change
the accuracy of abundance analysis.
  The physical causes of the ionic abundance errors are present in real
nebulae. In clumped models, helium ionizing radiation from zones of high
ionization (low He^0 and low UV opacity) can penetrate nearby regions near the
edge of the ionized zone. This effect allows He^0 to absorb more stellar
photons than in uniform or radially symmetrical geometries. In turn, these
absorptions compete with O+, etc., for those energetic stellar photons.",2005-03-26T16:52:30Z
Mass-Varying Neutrinos from a Variable Cosmological Constant,"We consider, in a completely model-independent way, the transfer of energy
between the components of the dark energy sector consisting of the cosmological
constant (CC) and that of relic neutrinos. We show that such a cosmological
setup may promote neutrinos to mass-varying particles, thus resembling a
recently proposed scenario of Fardon, Nelson, and Weiner (FNW), but now without
introducing any acceleronlike scalar fields. Although a formal similarity of
the FNW scenario with the variable CC one can be easily established, one
nevertheless finds different laws for neutrino mass variation in each scenario.
We show that as long as the neutrino number density dilutes canonically, only a
very slow variation of the neutrino mass is possible. For neutrino masses to
vary significantly (as in the FNW scenario), a considerable deviation from the
canonical dilution of the neutrino number density is also needed. We note that
the present `coincidence' between the dark energy density and the neutrino
energy density can be obtained in our scenario even for static neutrino masses.",2005-05-25T10:59:41Z
"Lorentz violation at high energy: concepts, phenomena and astrophysical
  constraints","We consider here the possibility of quantum gravity induced violation of
Lorentz symmetry (LV). Even if suppressed by the inverse Planck mass such LV
can be tested by current experiments and astrophysical observations. We review
the effective field theory approach to describing LV, the issue of naturalness,
and many phenomena characteristic of LV. We discuss some of the current
observational bounds on LV, focusing mostly on those from high energy
astrophysics in the QED sector at order E/M_Planck. In this context we present
a number of new results which include the explicit computation of rates of the
most relevant LV processes, the derivation of a new photon decay constraint,
and modification of previous constraints taking proper account of the helicity
dependence of the LV parameters implied by effective field theory.",2005-05-12T19:55:28Z
The puzzling case of GRB 990123: multiwavelength afterglow study,"We report on the BeppoSAX data analysis of the afterglow of Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) 990123, one of the brightest GRBs detected by BeppoSAX. Mainly due to its
exceptional brightness, this is the only source for which the Wide Field
Cameras have allowed an early detection of the X-ray afterglow between about 20
and 60 min after the GRB trigger. Besides, again for the first time,
high-energy emission from the afterglow was detected up to 60 keV. For the
X-ray afterglow we found a power-law decay with index alpha = 1.46 +/- 0.04;
the spectrum has a power-law shape with photon index Gamma about 1.9. The
backward extrapolation of the afterglow decay smoothly reconnects with the late
GRB emission, thus suggesting that both emissions are produced by the same
phenomenon. An extensive set of multiwavelength observations for the GRB 990123
afterglow made during the BeppoSAX pointing was collected from the literature.
The hard X-ray to radio range coverage allowed to construct a spectral flux
distribution and to perform an analysis of the GRB afterglow in the context of
the ""fireball"" model. We also report the results of temporal and spectral
analysis of an X-ray source serendipitously observed about 22 arcmin north of
the GRB afterglow, along with the optical spectroscopy of its possible
counterpart to establish the nature of this source.",2005-04-27T15:14:48Z
XMM-Newton observations of four millisecond pulsars,"I present an analysis of the XMM-Newton observations of four millisecond
pulsars, J0437-4715, J2124-3358, J1024-0719, and J0034-0534. The new data
provide strong evidence of thermal emission in the X-ray flux detected from the
first three objects. This thermal component is best interpreted as radiation
from pulsar polar caps covered with a nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere. A
nonthermal power-law component, dominating at energies E>3 keV, can also be
present in the detected X-ray emission. For PSR J0437-4715, the timing analysis
reveals that the shape and pulsed fraction of the pulsar light curves are
energy dependent. This, together with the results obtained from the
phase-resolved spectroscopy, supports the two-component (thermal plus
nonthermal) interpretation of the pulsar's X-ray radiation. Highly significant
pulsations have been found in the X-ray flux of PSRs J2124-3358 and J1024-0719.
For PSR J0034-0534, a possible X-ray counterpart of the radio pulsar has been
suggested. The inferred properties of the detected thermal emission are
compared with predictions of radio pulsar models.",2005-07-10T16:47:03Z
Curvature driven acceleration : a utopia or a reality ?,"The present work shows that a combination of nonlinear contribution from the
Ricci curvature in Einstein field equations can drive a late time acceleration
of expansion of the universe. The transit from the decelerated to the
accelerated phase of expansion takes place smoothly without having to resort to
a study of asymptotic behaviour. This result emphasizes the need for thorough
and critical examination of models with nonlinear contribution from the
curvature.",2005-05-05T12:32:31Z
The Small-Scale Power Spectrum of Cold Dark Matter,"One of the best motivated hypotheses in cosmology states that most of the
matter in the universe is in the form of weakly-interacting massive particles
that decoupled early in the history of the universe and cooled adiabatically to
an extremely low temperature. Nevertheless, the finite temperature and horizon
scales at which these particles decoupled imprint generic signatures on their
small scales density fluctuations. We show that the previously recognized
cut-off in the fluctuation power-spectrum due to free-streaming of particles at
the thermal speed of decoupling, is supplemented by acoustic oscillations owing
to the initial coupling between the cold dark matter (CDM) and the radiation
field. The power-spectrum oscillations appear on the scale of the horizon at
thermal decoupling which corresponds to a mass scale of
\~10^{-4}*(T_d/10MeV)^{-3} solar masses for a CDM decoupling temperature T_d.
The suppression of the power-spectrum on smaller scales by the acoustic
oscillations is physically independent from the free-streaming effect, although
the two cut-off scales are coincidentally comparable for T_d~10MeV and a
particle mass of M~100GeV. The initial conditions for recent numerical
simulations of the earliest and smallest objects to have formed in the
universe, need to be modified accordingly. The smallest dark matter clumps may
be detectable through gamma-ray production from particle annihilation, through
fluctuations in the event rate of direct detection experiments, or through
their tidal gravitational effect on wide orbits of objects near the outer edge
of the solar system.",2005-04-05T16:10:40Z
The Effect of Thermal Conduction on the Virgo Cluster,"Thermal conduction has been suggested as a possible mechanism by which
sufficient energy is supplied to the central regions of galaxy clusters to
balance the effect of radiative cooling. Here we present the results of a
simulated, high-resolution, 3-d Virgo cluster for different values of thermal
conductivity (1, 1/10, 1/100, 0 times the full Spitzer value). Starting from an
initially isothermal cluster atmosphere we allow the cluster to evolve freely
over timescales of roughly $ 1.3-4.7 \times 10^{9} $ yrs. Our results show that
thermal conductivity at the Spitzer value can increase the central ICM
radiative cooling time by a factor of roughly 3.6. In addition, for larger
values of thermal conductvity the simulated temperature and density profiles
match the observations significantly better than for the lower values. However,
no physically meaningful value of thermal conductivity was able to postpone the
cooling catastrophe (characterised by a rapid increase in the central density)
for longer than a fraction of the Hubble time nor explain the absence of a
strong cooling flow in the Virgo cluster today. We also calculate the effective
adiabatic index of the cluster gas for both simulation and observational data
and compare the values with theoretical expectations. Using this method it
appears that the Virgo cluster is being heated in the cluster centre by a
mechanism other than thermal conductivity. Based on this and our simulations it
is also likely that the thermal conductvity is suppressed by a factor of at
least 10 and probably more. Thus, we suggest that thermal conductvity, if
present at all, has the effect of slowing down the evolution of the ICM, by
radiative cooling, but only by a factor of a few.",2005-07-19T16:38:22Z
Deuterated H$_3^+$ in proto-planetary disks,"Probing the gas and dust in proto-planetary disks is central for
understanding the process of planet formation. In disks surrounding solar type
protostars, the bulk of the disk mass resides in the outer midplane, which is
cold ($\leq$20 K), dense ($\geq 10^7$ cm$^{-3}$) and depleted of CO. Observing
the disk midplane has proved, therefore, to be a formidable challenge.
Ceccarelli et al. (2004) detected H$_2$D$^+$ emission in a proto-planetary disk
and claimed that it probes the midplane gas. Indeed, since all heavy-elements
bearing molecules condense out onto the grain mantles, the most abundant ions
in the disk midplane are predicted to be H$_3^+$ and its isotopomers. In this
article, we carry out a theoretical study of the chemical structure of the
outer midplane of proto-planetary disks. Using a self-consistent physical model
for the flaring disk structure, we compute the abundances of H$_3^+$ and its
deuterated forms across the disk midplane. We also provide the average column
densities across the disk of H$_3^+$, H$_2$D$^+$, HD$_2^+$ and D$_3^+$, and
line intensities of the ground transitions of the ortho and para forms of
H$_2$D$^+$ and HD$_2^+$ respectively. We discuss how the results depend on the
cosmic ray ionization rate, dust-to-gas ratio and average grain radius, and
general stellar/disk parameters. An important factor is the poorly understood
freeze-out of N$_2$ molecules onto grains, which we investigate in depth. We
finally summarize the diagnostic values of observations of the H$_3^+$
isotopomers.",2005-06-11T09:01:42Z
"Hi-Res Spectroscopy of a Volume-Limited Hipparcos Sample within 100

subgiants because their ages can be derived accurately. Here, we present
preliminary results for 10 subgiants and discuss the future work for this
project. Our main scientific interest is to incorporate our results to
constrain the star formation history in the solar neighborhood.",2005-06-21T23:10:12Z
The Radio Afterglow and Host Galaxy of the Dark GRB 020819,"Of the fourteen gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) localized to better than 2' radius
with the SXC on HETE-2, only two lack optical afterglow detections, and the
high recovery rate among this sample has been used to argue that the fraction
of truly dark bursts is ~10%. While a large fraction of earlier dark bursts can
be explained by the failure of ground-based searches to reach appropriate
limiting magnitudes, suppression of the optical light of these SXC dark bursts
seems likely. Here we report the discovery and observation of the radio
afterglow of GRB 020819, an SXC dark burst, which enables us to identify the
likely host galaxy (probability of 99.2%) and hence the redshift (z=0.41) of
the GRB. The radio light curve is qualitatively similar to that of several
other radio afterglows, and may include an early-time contribution from the
emission of the reverse shock. The proposed host is a bright R = 19.5 mag
barred spiral galaxy, with a faint R ~ 24.0 mag ""blob'' of emission, 3"" from
the galaxy core (16 kpc in projection), that is coincident with the radio
afterglow. Optical photometry of the galaxy and blob, beginning 3 hours after
the burst and extending over more than 100 days, establishes strong upper
limits to the optical brightness of any afterglow or associated supernova.
Combining the afterglow radio fluxes and our earliest R-band limit, we find
that the most likely afterglow model invokes a spherical expansion into a
constant-density (rather than stellar wind-like) external environment; within
the context of this model, a modest local extinction of A_V ~ 1 mag is
sufficient to suppress the optical flux below our limits.",2005-05-02T20:25:46Z
Theoretical Aspects of Gravitational Lensing in TeVeS,"Since Bekenstein's (2004) creation of his Tensor-Vector-Scalar theory
(TeVeS), the Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm has been redeemed from
the embarrassment of lacking a relativistic version. One primary success of
TeVeS is that it provides an enhancement of gravitational lensing, which could
not be achieved by other MONDian theories. Following Bekenstein's work, we
investigate the phenomena of gravitational lensing including deflection angles,
lens equations and time delay. We find that the deflection angle would maintain
its value while the distance of closest approach vary in the MOND regime, this
coincides with the conclusion of Mortlock and Turner's (2001) intuitional
approach. Moreover, the scalar field, which is introduced to enhance the
deflection angle in TeVeS, contributes a negative effect on the potential time
delay. Unfortunately this phenomenon is unmeasurable in lensing systems where
we can only observe the time delay between two images for a given source.
However, this measurable time delay offers another constraint on the mass ratio
of the DM and MOND scenarios, which in general differs from that given by the
deflection angle. In other words, for a lensing system, if two masses, m_gN and
m_gM, are mutually alternatives for the deflection angles in their own
paradigm, regarding the time delay they are in general in an exclusive
relation.",2005-07-13T19:08:43Z
"Star Formation and Dust Attenuation Properties in Galaxies from a
  Statistical UV-to-FIR Analysis","We study two galaxy samples selected in ultraviolet (UV) and in far-infrared
(FIR) for which the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far UV (FUV)
to the FIR are available. We compare the observed SEDs to modelled SEDs with
several star formation histories (SFHs; decaying star formation rate plus
burst) and attenuation laws (power law + 2175 Angstroem bump). The Bayesian
method allows to estimate statistically the best parameters by comparing each
observed SED to the full set of 82800 models. We reach the conclusion that the
UV dust attenuation cannot be estimated correctly from an SED analysis if the
FIR information is not used. The deduced dispersion is larger than with the FIR
data and the distribution is not symetrically distributed about zero: there is
an over-estimation for UV-selected galaxies and an under-estimation for
FIR-selected galaxies. The output from the analysis process suggests that
UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in average similar to the LMC
extinction while FIR-selected galaxy attenuation laws more resemble the MW
extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the
Log(Fdust/Ffuv) vs. FUV-NUV diagram (once the main relation with FUV-NUV is
accounted for) is explained by two other parameters: the slope of the
attenuation law and the instantaneous birthrate parameter b_0 for UV-selected
galaxies and the same ones plus the strength of the bump for the FIR-selected
galaxies. We propose a recipe to estimate the UV dust attenuation for
UV-galaxies only (that should be used whenever the FIR information is not
available because the resulting Afuv is poorly defined with an uncertainty of
about 0.32): A_{FUV} = 1.4168 (FUV-NUV)^2 + 0.3298 (NUV-I)^2 + 2.1207 (FUV-NUV)
+ 2.7465 (NUV-I) + 5.8408",2005-04-20T08:42:51Z
"Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems: Cold Outer Disks
  Associated with Sun-like stars","We present the discovery of debris systems around three solar mass stars
based upon observations performed with the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of a
Legacy Science Program, ``the Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems''
(FEPS). We also confirm the presence of debris around two other stars. All the
stars exhibit infrared emission in excess of the expected photospheres in the
70 micron band, but are consistent with photospheric emission at <= 33 micron.
This restricts the maximum temperature of debris in equilibrium with the
stellar radiation to T < 70 K. We find that these sources are relatively old in
the FEPS sample, in the age range 0.7 - 3 Gyr. Based on models of the spectral
energy distributions, we suggest that these debris systems represent materials
generated by collisions of planetesimal belts. We speculate on the nature of
these systems through comparisons to our own Kuiper Belt, and on the likely
planet(s) responsible for stirring the system and ultimately releasing dust
through collisions. We further report observations of a nearby star HD 13974 (d
=11 pc) that is indistinguishable from a bare photosphere at both 24 micron and
70 micron. The observations place strong upper limits on the presence of any
cold dust in this nearby system (L_IR/L_* < 10^{-5.2}).",2005-06-18T00:26:14Z
"A Detailed Study of Molecular Clouds toward the TeV Gamma-Ray SNR
  G347.3-0.5","We present a detailed study of molecular gas toward the supernovae remnant
G347.3-0.5 (J1713.7-3946) obtained with the 4m mm/sub-mm telescope NANTEN .
This study has revealed that several intensity peaks and the overall
distribution of the molecular gas with radial velocities from -12 km s-1 to -3
km s-1 show a remarkably good correlation with the X-ray features, strongly
supporting the kinematic distance ~ 1 kpc derived by Fukui et al. (2003), as
opposed to 6 kpc previously claimed. In addition, we show that absorption of
X-rays is caused by local molecular gas at softer X-ray bands. Subsequent
measurements of the CO(J=3-2) made with the ASTE 10 m and CSO 10.4 m telescopes
toward the molecular intensity peaks have revealed higher excitation
conditions, most likely higher temperatures above ~ 30 K as compared to that of
the typical gas in low mass dark clouds. This is most likely caused by enhanced
heating by the high energy events in the SNR, where possible mechanisms include
heating by X-rays, gamma-rays, and/or cosmic ray protons, although we admit
additional radiative heating by young protostars embedded may be working as
well. In one of the CO peaks, we have confirmed the presence of broad molecular
wings of ~ 20 km s-1 velocity extent in the CO(J=3-2) transition. The SNR
evolution is well explained as the free expansion phase based on the distance
of 1 kpc.",2005-06-21T12:40:11Z
"The same physics underlying SGRs, AXPs, and radio pulsars","Unexpected sign, significant magnitude and time-variation of frequency second
derivative exist not only in singular radio pulsars but also in Soft Gamma
repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). This paper shows that the
these phenomena are related, and can be interpreted by a simple unified model,
long-term orbital effect. Thus many of previous ``isolated'' pulsars may be
binary pulsars, i.e., orbital period
  $P_b\approx(47, 72)$min for AXP 1E 2259+586, and $P_b\approx (20, 34)$min for
PSR J1614-5047, $P_b\approx (3.6, 6.4)$min for SGR 1900+14, and $P_b\approx
(1.5, 5.8)$min for SGR 1806-20. In addition to X-ray pulsar, 1E 1207.4-5209,
these two SGRs may be the new ultra-compact binary pulsars with orbital period
of a few minutes. There might be more binary pulsars that suitable for
gravitational wave detection than we had thought.",2005-04-07T03:07:10Z
"The INT/WFC survey of the Monoceros Ring: Accretion origin or Galactic
  Anomaly?","We present the results of a wide-field camera survey of the stars in the
Monoceros Ring, thought to be an additional structure in the Milky Way of
unknown origin. Lying roughly in the plane of the Milky Way, this may represent
a unique equatorial accretion event which is contributing to the Thick Disk of
the Galaxy. Alternatively, the Monoceros Ring may be a natural part of the Disk
formation process. With ten pointings in symmetric pairs above and below the
plane of the Galaxy, this survey spans 90 degrees about the Milky Way's
equator. Signatures of the stream of stars were detected in three fields, ({\it
l},{\it b}) = (118,+16)$^\circ$ and (150,+15)$^\circ$ plus a more tentative
detection at (150,-15)$^\circ$. Galactocentric distance estimates to these
structures gave $\sim$17, $\sim$17, and $\sim$13 kpc respectively. The
Monoceros Ring seems to be present on both sides of the Galactic plane, in a
form different to that of the Galactic suggestive of a tidal origin with
streams multiply wrapping the Galaxy. A new model of the stream has shown a
strong coincidence with our results and has also provided the opportunity to
make several more detections in fields in which the stream is less significant.
The confirmed detection at ({\it l},{\it b}) = (123,-19)$^\circ$ at $\sim$14,
kpc from the Galactic centre allows a re-examination revealing a tentative new
detection with a Galactocentric distance of $\sim$21 kpc. (Abridged)",2005-06-22T03:06:52Z

"X-ray synchrotron emission from the oblique shock in the jet of the
  powerful radio galaxy 3C 346","We report the first detection, with Chandra, of X-ray emission from the jet
of the powerful narrow-line radio galaxy 3C 346. X-rays are detected from the
bright radio and optical knot at which the jet apparently bends by about 70
degrees. The Chandra observation also reveals a bright galaxy-scale atmosphere
within the previously-known cluster, and provides a good X-ray spectrum for the
bright core of 3C 346. The X-ray emission from the knot is synchrotron
radiation, as seen in lower-power sources. In common with these sources, there
is evidence of morphological differences between the radio/optical and X-ray
structures, and the spectrum is inconsistent with a one-component
continuous-injection model. We suggest that the X-ray-bright knot is associated
with a strong oblique shock in a moderately relativistic, light jet, at about
20 degrees to the line of sight, and that this shock is caused by the jet
interacting with the wake in the cluster medium behind 3C 346's companion
galaxy. The general jet curvature can result from pressure gradients in the
cluster atmosphere.",2005-04-06T09:21:10Z

telescope. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the ability to obtain very
high precision photometry for a large number of stars. We achieved better than
1% precision for more than 8000 stars with 14.3 < R < 20.1 and
sub-millimagnitude (as low as 0.36 mmag) precision for over 300 stars with 14.6
< R < 16.3 in the field of this cluster. We also discovered 8 new variable
stars, including a possible delta-Scuti variable with an amplitude of 2%, 6
likely W UMa contact binaries, and a possible RS CVn star, and we identified 5
suspected low-amplitude variables, including one star with an amplitude of 3
mmag. We comment on the implications of this study for a ground-based survey
for transiting planets as small as Neptune.",2005-04-21T21:10:16Z
"Rest-frame optical and far-infrared observations of extremely bright
  Lyman-break galaxy candidates at z ~ 2.5","We have investigated the rest-frame optical and far-infrared properties of a
sample of extremely bright candidate Lyman-break galaxies (LBG) identified in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Their high ultraviolet luminosities and lack of
strong ultraviolet emission lines are suggestive of massive starbursts,
although it is possible that they are more typical luminosity LBGs which have
been highly magnified by strong gravitational lensing. Alternatively, they may
be an unusual class of weak-lined quasars. If the ultraviolet and submillimetre
properties of these objects mirror those of less luminous, starburst LBGs, then
they should have detectable rest-frame far-infrared emission. However, our
submm photometry fails to detect such emission, indicating that these systems
are not merely scaled-up (either intrinsically or as a result of lensing)
examples of typical LBGs. In addition we have searched for the morphological
signatures of strong lensing, using high-resolution, near-infrared imaging, but
we find none. Instead, near-infrared spectroscopy reveals that these systems
are, in fact, a rare class of broad absorption-line (BAL) quasars.",2005-06-21T13:02:06Z
"Search for Cross-Correlations of Ultra--High-Energy Cosmic Rays with BL
  Lacertae Objects","We present the results of searches for correlation between ultra--high-energy
cosmic rays observed in stereo mode by the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes)
experiment and objects of the BL Lac subclass of active galaxies. In
particular, we discuss an excess of events correlating with confirmed BL Lacs
in the Veron 10th Catalog. As described in detail in Abbasi et al. (2005), the
significance level of these correlations cannot be reliably estimated due to
the a posteriori nature of the search, and the results must be tested
independently before any claim can be made. We identify the precise hypotheses
that will be tested with independent data.",2005-07-20T02:42:43Z
Rapid growth of high redshift black holes,"We discuss a model for the early assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical build-up far up in the
dark halo `merger tree'. Motivated by the observations of luminous quasars
around redshift z=6 with SMBH masses of billion solar masses, we assess the
possibility of an early phase of stable super-critical quasi-spherical
accretion in the BHs hosted by metal free halos with virial temperature larger
than 10000 K. We assume that the first `seed' black holes formed with
intermediate masses following the collapse of the first generation of stars, in
mini-halos collapsing at z=20-30 from high peaks of density fluctuations. In
high redshift halos with virial temperature larger than 10000 K, conditions
exist for the formation of a fat disc of gas at T_gas=5000-10000 K. Cooling via
hydrogen atomic lines is in fact effective in these comparatively massive
halos. The cooling and collapse of an initially spherical configuration of gas
leads to a rotationally supported disc at the center of the halo if baryons
preserve their specific angular momentum during collapse. The conditions for
the formation of the gas disc and accretion onto a central black holes out of
this supply of gas are investigated, as well as the feedback of the emission
onto the host and onto the intergalactic medium. We find that even a short
phase of supercritical accretion eases the requirements set by the z=6 quasars.",2005-06-02T14:38:08Z
"Universal lateral distribution of energy deposit in air showers and its
  application to shower reconstruction","The light intensity distribution in a shower image and its implications to
the primary energy reconstructed by the fluorescence technique are studied.
Based on detailed CORSIKA energy deposit simulations, a universal analytical
formula is derived for the lateral distribution of light in the shower image
and a correction factor is obtained to account for the fraction of shower light
falling into outlying pixels in the detector. The expected light profiles and
the corresponding correction of the primary shower energy are illustrated for
several typical event geometries. This correction of the shower energy can
exceed 10%, depending on shower geometry.",2005-05-18T11:29:40Z
"Validation of the Real and Simulated Data of the Pierre Auger
  Fluorescence Telescopes","The fluorescence detector (FD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory is currently
operating 18 fluorescence telescopes of the 24 that will be employed in the
completed detector. These telescopes, grouped in 4 eyes each consisting of 6
telescopes, measure the longitudinal profile of cosmic ray showers with a 14%
duty cycle. The reconstruction capability and triggering efficiency have been
studied using a complete simulation and reconstruction production chain,
employing both simulated CORSIKA showers and parameterised Gaisser-Hillas
profiles. The propagation through the atmosphere and the detector response are
taken into account and simulated in detail. These simulated data have been
generated in a preliminary analysis using the method of importance sampling to
efficiently cover the energy region of 0.3 - 300 EeV, various shower geometries
and impact points and different primary particles. The distributions of
observables have then been investigated in both real and simulated data,
facilitating the validation of the reconstruction and simulation software.
Comparisons of real and simulated data are discussed and used to assess their
impact on the data analysis.",2005-07-20T19:30:11Z
Patterns of energy-dependent variability from Comptonization,"We study fractional variability as a function of energy from black-hole X-ray
binaries on timescales from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. We build a
theoretical model of energy-dependent variability in which the X-ray energy
spectrum varies in response to a changing physical parameter. We compare these
models to rms spectra obtained from RXTE PCA observations of black-hole
binaries XTE J1550-564 and XTE J1650-500. We show that two main variability
models are consistent with the data: variable seed photon input in the hard
state and variable power in the Comptonized component in the soft and very high
states. The lack of clear reflection features in the rms spectra implies that
the reflection and the X-ray continuum, when integrated over Fourier
frequencies, are correlated and vary with similar fractional amplitudes. Our
models predict two important features of rms spectra, not possible to be
clearly seen by the PCA due sensitivity limits. At soft X-rays, >~3 keV, we
predict the presence of a break in the rms spectrum at energy directly related
to the seed photon temperature. At higher energies, ~20--30 keV, we predict a
peak in the rms spectrum originating from the variability of the spectrum
produced by a hybrid thermal/non-thermal electron distribution. If these
features are confirmed by broad-band observations, they will impose important
constraints on the origin of the seed photons for Comptonization and the
electron distribution in the hot plasma.",2005-06-16T16:05:25Z
"X-ray Emission from Orion Nebula Cluster Stars with Circumstellar Disks
  and Jets","We investigate the X-ray and near-infrared emission properties of a sample of
pre-main sequence (PMS) stellar systems in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) that
display evidence for circumstellar disks (``proplyds'') and optical jets in
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. Approximately 70% of ~140 proplyds were
detected as X-ray sources in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Program observation of
the ONC, including ~25% of proplyds that do not display central stars in HST
imaging. Many proplyds display near-infrared excesses, suggesting disk
accretion is ongoing onto the central, PMS stars. Among circumstellar disks
that are detected in absorption in HST imaging, we find that X-ray absorbing
column and apparent disk inclination are well correlated, providing insight
into the disk scale heights and metal abundances of UV- and X-ray-irradiated
protoplanetary disks. Jet sources display some of the largest near-infrared
excesses among the X-ray-detected proplyds, suggesting that the origin of the
jets is closely related to ongoing, PMS stellar accretion. Some jet sources
display double-peaked X-ray spectral energy distributions, with soft components
indicative of strong shocks in the jet collimation region. These results
support models in which circumstellar disks collimate and/or launch jets from
young stellar objects and, furthermore, demonstrate that star-disk-jet
interactions may contribute to PMS X-ray emission.",2005-06-27T15:53:58Z
"Detection of a hot core in the intermediate-mass (IM) Class 0 protostar
  NGC 7129--FIRS2","We report high angular resolution (~0.6''x0.5'' at 1.3mm) observations of the
Class 0 intermediate-mass (IM) protostar NGC 7129--FIRS 2 using the PdBI. Our
observations show the existence of a hot core at the position of the Class 0
object. This is, up to our knowledge, the first IM hot core detected so far.
Interferometric maps of the region in the the continuum at 3mm and 1.3mm and in
the CH3CN 5_k-->4_k, CH3OH 5_kk'-->4_kk', and D2CO 4_04-->3_03 lines are
presented in this paper. Enhanced CH3CN and CH3OH abundances are measured
towards the hot core (X(CH3CN)~7.010^{-9}, X(CH3OH)~3 10^{-8}-- a few 10^{-7}).
While intense D2CO emission is detected towards the hot core, the N2D+ line has
not been detected in our interferometric observations. The different behaviors
of D2CO and N2D+ emissions suggest different formation mechanisms for the two
species and different deuteration processes for H2CO and N2H+ (surface and
gas-phase chemistry, respectively). Finally, the spectrum of the large
bandwidth correlator show a forest of lines at the hot core position revealing
that this object is extraordinarily rich in complex molecules.",2005-06-27T15:26:11Z
"Inertial Current Generators of Poynting Flux in MHD Simulations of Black
  Hole Ergospheres","This Letter investigates the physics that is responsible for creating the
current system that supports the outgoing Poynting flux emanating from the
ergosphere of a rotating black hole in the limit that the magnetic energy
density greatly exceeds the plasma rest mass density (magnetically dominated
limit). The underlying physics is derived from published three-dimensional
simulations that obey the general relativistic equations of perfect
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). It is found that the majority of the Poynting flux
emitted from the magnetically dominated regions of the ergosphere has a source
associated with inertial effects outside of the event horizon.",2005-05-04T18:36:37Z
"The obscuration by dust of most of the growth of supermassive black
  holes","Supermassive black holes underwent periods of exponential growth during which
we seem them as quasars in the distant Universe. The summed emission from these
quasars generates the cosmic X-ray background, the spectrum of which has been
used to argue that most black-hole growth is obscured. There are clear examples
of obscured black-hole growth in the form of `type-2' quasars, but their
numbers are fewer than expected from modelling of the X-ray background. Here we
report on the direct detection of a population of distant type-2 quasars which
is at least comparable in size to the well-known unobscured type-1 population.
We selected objects that have mid-infrared and radio emissions characteristic
of quasars, but which are faint at near-infrared and optical wavelengths. This
population is responsible for most of the black hole growth in the young
Universe and, throughout cosmic history, black-hole growth occurs in the dusty,
gas-rich centres of active galaxies.",2005-05-24T09:14:07Z
"Absolute Calibration of the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space
  Telescope","The Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope is absolutely
calibrated by comparing photometry on a set of A stars near the north ecliptic
pole to predictions based on ground-based observations and a stellar atmosphere
model. The brightness of point sources is calibrated to an accuracy of 3%,
relative to models for A star stellar atmospheres, for observations performed
and analyzed in the same manner as the calibration stars. This includes
corrections for location of the star in the array and the location if the
centroid within the peak pixel. Long-term stability of the IRAC photometry was
measured by monitoring the brightness of A dwarfs and K giants (near the north
ecliptic pole) observed several times per month; the photometry is stable to
1.5% (rms) over a year. Intermediate-time-scale stability of the IRAC
photometry was measured by monitoring at least one secondary calibrator (near
the ecliptic plane) every 12 hr while IRAC is in nominal operations; the
intermediate-term photometry is stable with a 1% dispersion (rms). One of the
secondary calibrators was found to have significantly time-variable (5%)
mid-infrared emission, with period (7.4 days) matching the optical light curve;
it is possibly a Cepheid variable.",2005-07-06T17:07:26Z
"SGR giant flares in the BATSE short GRB catalogue: constraints from
  spectroscopy","The giant flare observed on Dec. 27th 2004 from SGR 1806-20 has revived the
idea that a fraction of short (<2 s) Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) is due to giant
flares from Soft Gamma Ray Repeaters located in nearby galaxies. One of the
distinguishing characteristics of these events is the thermal (black body)
spectrum with temperatures ranging from ~50 to ~180 keV, with the highest
temperature observed for the initial 0.2 s spike of the Dec. 27th 2004 event.
We analyzed the spectra of a complete sample of short GRBs with peak fluxes
greater than 4 photon s^(-1) cm^(-2) detected by BATSE. Of the 115 short GRBs
so selected only 76 had sufficient signal to noise to allow the spectral
analysis. We find only 3 short GRBs with a spectrum well fitted by a black
body, with 60<kT<90 keV, albeit with a considerably longer duration (i.e. >1
sec) and a more complex light curve than the Dec. 27th 2004 event. This implies
a stringent limit on the rate of extragalactic SGR giant flares with spectral
properties analogous to the Dec. 27th flare. We conclude that up to 4 per cent
of the short GRBs could be associated to giant flares (2 sigma confidence).
This implies that either the distance to SGR 1806-20 is smaller than 15 kpc or
the rate of Galactic giant flares is lower than the estimated 0.033 per year.",2005-04-13T20:21:45Z
"A Wide-field Hubble Space Telescope Survey of the Cluster Cl 0024+16 at
  z=0.4. III: Spectroscopic Signatures of Environmental Evolution in Early Type
  Galaxies","We report results from a panoramic spectroscopic survey of 955 objects in the
field of the rich cluster Cl 0024+1654 (z~0.4), complementing the HST imaging
presented in the first paper in this series. Our new spectroscopic sample
includes over 200 high quality spectra of cluster members, spread across an
area 10 Mpc in diameter. We examine the properties of a large sample of 104
cluster early-types as a function of cluster radius and local density, using
them as sensitive tracers of the various physical processes that may be
responsible for galaxy evolution. By constructing the Fundamental Plane of Cl
0024, we infer an evolution in the mean mass to light ratio of early-types
equal to \Delta<Log (M/L_V)> = -0.14 +- 0.02. In the cluster center, we detect
a significantly increased scatter in the relationship compared to that seen in
local clusters. Moreover, we observe a clear radial trend in the mass to light
ratios of individual early types, with the oldest galaxies located in the
cluster core. Galaxies are apparently younger at larger radius, with E+S0s in
the periphery having M/L_V ratios that nearly match values seen in the field at
a similar redshift. Independent spectral indicators used in combination reveal
an abrupt interaction with the cluster environment which occurs near the virial
radius of Cl 0024, revealed by small bursts of star formation in a population
of dim early-types, as well as by enhanced Balmer absorption for a set of
larger E+S0s closer to the cluster core. We construct a simple infall model
used to compare the timescales and strengths of the observed interactions in
this cluster. We examine the possibility that bursts of star formation are
triggered when galaxies suffer shocks as they encounter the intra-cluster
medium, or by the onset of galaxy harassment.",2005-08-02T22:52:27Z
"The Large-Scale Electrochemistry and Possible Consequences of Deep
  Impact Mission to Tempel 1","Some consequences of hypervelocity impact onto the comet Tempel 1 nucleus are

that underwent global explosions.",2005-05-18T14:02:44Z
"A library of high resolution synthetic stellar spectra from 300nm to 1.8
  micron with solar and alpha-enhanced composition","Libraries of stellar spectra are fundamental tools for the study of stellar
populations and both empirical and synthetic libraries have been used for this
purpose. In this paper, a new library of high resolution synthetic spectra is
presented, ranging from the near-ultraviolet (300nm) to the near-infrared
(1.8${\rm \mu}$m). The library spans all the stellar types that are relevant to
the integrated light of old and intermediate-age stellar populations in the
involved spectral region (spectral types F through M and all luminosity
classes). The grid was computed for metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = --2.5
to +0.5, including both solar and $\alpha$-enhanced ([$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.4)
chemical compositions. The synthetic spectra are a good match to observations
of stars throughout the stellar parameter space encompassed by the library and
over the whole spectral region covered by the computations.",2005-05-25T13:56:38Z
Cosmological Parameters from the 2003 flight of BOOMERANG,"We present the cosmological parameters from the CMB intensity and
polarization power spectra of the 2003 Antarctic flight of the BOOMERANG
telescope. The BOOMERANG data alone constrains the parameters of the
$\Lambda$CDM model remarkably well and is consistent with constraints from a
multi-experiment combined CMB data set. We add LSS data from the 2dF and SDSS
redshift surveys to the combined CMB data set and test several extensions to
the standard model including: running of the spectral index, curvature, tensor
modes, the effect of massive neutrinos, and an effective equation of state for
dark energy. We also include an analysis of constraints to a model which allows
a CDM isocurvature admixture.",2005-07-21T17:15:31Z
"Upper limit on the primary photon fraction from the Pierre Auger
  Observatory","Based on observations of the depth of shower maximum performed with the
hybrid detector of the Auger Observatory, an upper limit on the cosmic-ray
photon fraction of 26% (at 95% confidence level) is derived for primary
energies above 10^19 eV. Additional observables recorded with the surface
detector array, available for a sub-set of the data sample, support the
conclusion that a photon origin of the observed events is not favoured.",2005-07-18T10:41:29Z
Resolving the Hard X-ray Emission of GX 5-1 with INTEGRAL,"We present the study of one year of INTEGRAL data on the neutron star low
mass X-ray binary GX 5-1. Thanks to the excellent angular resolution and
sensitivity of INTEGRAL, we are able to obtain a high quality spectrum of GX
5-1 from ~5 keV to ~100 keV, for the first time without contamination from the
nearby black hole candidate GRS 1758-258 above 20 keV. During our observations,
GX 5-1 is mostly found in the horizontal and normal branch of its hardness
intensity diagram. A clear hard X-ray emission is observed above ~30 keV which
exceeds the exponential cut-off spectrum expected from lower energies. This
spectral flattening may have the same origin of the hard components observed in
other Z sources as it shares the property of being characteristic to the
horizontal branch. The hard excess is explained by introducing Compton
up-scattering of soft photons from the neutron star surface due to a thin hot
plasma expected in the boundary layer. The spectral changes of GX 5-1 downward
along the ""Z"" pattern in the hardness intensity diagram can be well described
in terms of monotonical decrease of the neutron star surface temperature. This
may be a consequence of the gradual expansion of the boundary layer as the mass
accretion rate increases.",2005-07-15T17:16:49Z
The Progenitor of Supernova 2004dj in a Star Cluster,"The progenitor of type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2004dj is identified with a
supergiant in a compact star cluster known as ""Sandage Star 96"" (S96) in the
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2403, which was fortuitously imaged as part of the
Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey from Feb 1995
to Dec 2003 prior to SN 2004dj. The superior photometry of BATC images for S96,
taken with 14 intermediate-band filters covering 3000-10000\AA, unambiguously
establishes the star cluster nature of S96 with an age of $\sim 20$Myr, a
reddening of $\hbox{E}(B-V)\sim 0.35$ mag and a total mass of $\sim
96,000$M$_{\odot}$. The compact star cluster nature of S96 is also consistent
with the lack of light variations in the past decade. The SN progenitor is
estimated to have a main-sequence mass of $\sim$12M$_{\odot}$. The comparison
of our intermediate-band data of S96 with the post-outburst photometry obtained
as the SN has significantly dimmed, may hopefully conclusively establish the
nature of the progenitor.",2005-05-14T01:22:06Z
Observations of the BL Lac Object 3C 66A with STACEE,"We present the analysis and results of recent high-energy gamma-ray
observations of the BL Lac object 3C 66A conducted with the Solar Tower
Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE). During the 2003-2004
observing season, STACEE extensively observed 3C 66A as part of a
multiwavelength campaign on the source. A total of 33.7 hours of data was taken
on the source, plus an equivalent-duration background observation. After
cleaning the data set a total of 16.3 hours of live time remained, and a net
on-source excess of 1134 events was seen against a background of 231742 events.
At a significance of 2.2 standard deviations this excess is insufficient to
claim a detection of 3C 66A, but is used to establish flux upper limits for the
source.",2005-04-23T03:09:53Z
"Emission-line spectroscopy of Damped Lyman Alpha Systems: The case of
  SBS 1543+593/HS 1543+5921","We report HST/STIS spectroscopy and Gemini/GMOS-N imaging of the Damped Lyman
Alpha (DLA) system toward HS 1543+5921 caused by the host star-forming galaxy
(SFG) SBS 1543+593. The Gemini image shows new morphological details of this
well resolved DLA galaxy. In combination with previous optical spectra, the new
UV spectra enable us to compare for the first time, ionized and neutral
gas-phase alpha-element abundances derived from emission- and absorption-line
spectroscopy, in a bona fide DLA galaxy. The abundances we determine using
emission-line diagnostics agree with those from absorption-line diagnostics. We
present our results on a metallicity versus redshift diagram that combines
local HII regions and SFGs with high-redshift DLAs, and discuss implications
for the chemical evolution of galaxies.",2005-04-25T19:55:30Z
A Physical Model for the joint evolution of high-z QSOs and Spheroids,"We summarize our physical model for the early co-evolution of spheroidal
galaxies and of active nuclei at their centers. Our predictions are in
excellent agreement with a number of observables which proved to be extremely
challenging for all the current semi-analytic models, including the sub-mm
counts and the corresponding redshift distributions, and the epoch-dependent
K-band luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies. Also, the black hole mass
function and the relationship between the black hole mass and the velocity
dispersion in the galaxy are nicely reproduced. The mild AGN activity revealed
by X-ray observations of SCUBA sources is in keeping with our scenario, and
testify the build up of SMBH triggered by intense star formation.",2005-04-21T16:19:54Z
"The INT Photometric H-alpha Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane
  (IPHAS)","The INT Photometric Halpha Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS) is a
1800 square degrees CCD survey of the northern Milky Way spanning the latitude
range -5 < b < +5 (degrees) and reaching down to r' ~ 20 (10-sigma). It may
increase the number of known northern emission line sources by an order of
magnitude. Representative observations and an assessment of point-source data
from IPHAS, now underway, are presented. The data obtained are Wide Field
Camera images in Halpha narrow-band, and Sloan r' and i' broad-band, filters.
We simulate IPHAS (r' - Halpha, r' - i') point-source colours using a
spectrophotometric library of stellar spectra and available filter transmission
profiles: this gives expected colours for (i) solar-metallicity stars, without
Halpha emission, and (ii) emission line stars. Comparisons with Aquila field
observations show that simulated normal star colours reproduce the data well
for spectral types earlier than M. Spectroscopic follow-up of a Cepheus field
confirms that sources lying above the main stellar locus in the (r' - Halpha,
r' - i') plane are emission line objects, with very few failures. Examples of
Halpha deficit objects -- a white dwarf and a carbon star -- are shown to be
readily distinguished by their IPHAS colours. The role IPHAS can play in
studies of nebulae is discussed briefly, and illustrated by a
continuum-subtracted mosaic image of the SNR, Shajn 147. The final catalogue of
IPHAS point sources will contain photometry on ~80 million objects. (abridged)",2005-06-29T15:27:59Z
Fast multilevel radiative transfer,"The vast majority of recent advances in the field of numerical radiative
transfer relies on approximate operator methods better known in astrophysics as
Accelerated Lambda-Iteration (ALI). A superior class of iterative schemes, in
term of rates of convergence, such as Gauss-Seidel and Successive
Overrelaxation methods were therefore quite naturally introduced in the field
of radiative transfer by Trujillo Bueno & Fabiani Bendicho (1995); it was
thoroughly described for the non-LTE two-level atom case. We describe hereafter
in details how such methods can be generalized when dealing with non-LTE
unpolarised radiation transfer with multilevel atomic models, in
monodimensional geometry.",2005-07-01T12:04:11Z
"Observations in the 1.3 and 1.5 THz Atmospheric Windows with the
  Receiver Lab Telescope","The Receiver Lab Telescope (RLT) is a ground-based terahertz telescope; it is
currently the only instrument producing astronomical data between 1 and 2 THz.
The capabilities of the RLT have been expanding since observations began in
late 2002. Initial observations were limited to the 850 GHz and 1.03 THz
windows due to the availability of solid state local oscillators. In the last
year we have begun observations with new local oscillators for the 1.3 and 1.5
THz atmospheric windows. These oscillators provide access to the 11-10 and
13-12 lines of CO at 1.267 and 1.497 THz, as well as the [N II] line at 1.461
THz. We report on our first measurements of these high CO transitions, which
represent the highest-frequency detections ever made from the ground. We also
present initial observations of [N II] and discuss the implications of this
non-detection for the standard estimates of the strength of this line.",2005-05-12T22:52:07Z
"Pulsation and evolutionary masses of classical Cepheids. I. Milky Way
  variables","We investigate a selected sample of Galactic classical Cepheids with
available distance and reddening estimates in the framework of the theoretical
scenario provided by pulsation models, computed with metal abundance Z=0.02,
helium content in the range of Y=0.25 to 0.31, and various choices of the
stellar mass and luminosity. After transforming the bolometric light curve of
the fundamental models into BVRIJK magnitudes, we derived analytical relations
connecting the pulsation period with the stellar mass, the mean
(intensity-averaged) absolute magnitude, and the color of the pulsators. These
relations are used together with the Cepheid observed absolute magnitudes in
order to determine the ""pulsation"" mass -M_p- of each individual variable. The
comparison with the ""evolutionary"" masses -M_(e,can)- given by canonical (no
convective core overshooting, no mass-loss) models of central He-burning
stellar structures reveals that the M_p/M_(e,can) ratio is correlated with the
Cepheid period, ranging from about 0.8 at logP=0.5 to about 1 at logP=1.5. We
discuss the effects of different input physics and/or assumptions on the
evolutionary computations, as well as of uncertainties in the adopted Cepheid
metal content, distance, and reddening. Eventually, we find that the
pulsational results can be interpreted in terms of mass-loss during or before
the Cepheid phase, whose amount increases as the Cepheid original mass
decreases. It vanishes around 13M_(sun) and increases up to about 20% at
4M_(sun).",2005-05-08T10:11:58Z
Scattering properties and composition of cometary dust,"Composition of Comet dust obtained by the dust impact analyser on the Halley
probes indicated that the comet dust is a mixure of silicate and carbonaceous
material. The collected interplanetary dust particles (IDP's) are fluffy and
composite having grains of several different types stuck together. Using
Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) we study the scattering properties of
composite grains. In particular, we study the angular distribution of the
scattered intensity and linear polarization of composite grains. We assume that
the composite grains are made up of host silicate sphere/spheroid with the
inclusions of graphite. Results of our calculations on the composite grains
show that the angle of maximum polarization shifts, and the degree of
polarizaion varies with the volume fraction of inclusions. We use these results
on the composite grains to interpret the observed scattering in the cometary
dust.",2005-04-12T10:30:24Z
Dark Matter from Early Decays,"Two leading dark matter candidates from supersymmetry and other theories of
physics beyond the standard model are WIMPs and weak scale gravitinos. If the
lightest stable particle is a gravitino, then a WIMP will decay into it with a
natural lifetime of order a month ~ M_{pl}^2/M_{weak}^3. We show that if the
bulk of dark matter today came from decays of neutral particles with lifetimes
of order a year or smaller, then it could lead to a reduction in the amount of
small scale substructure, less concentrated halos and constant density cores in
the smallest mass halos. Such beneficial effects may therefore be realized
naturally, as discussed by Cembranos, Feng, Rajaraman, and Takayama, in the
case of supersymmetry.",2005-07-13T18:58:02Z
"FrogEye, the Quantum Coronagraphic mask. The Photon Orbital Angular
  Momentum and its applications to Astronomy","We propose to realize an optical device based on the properties of photon
orbital angular momentum (POAM) to detect the presence of closeby faint
companions in double systems using Laguerre-Gaussian (L-G) modes of the light.
We test also the possibility of using L-G modes to build coronagraph mask. We
realized in the laboratory a prototype using a blazed l=1 hologram to simulate
the separation between two stars, as observed with a telescope, in
Laguerre-Gaussian modes.",2005-05-27T18:35:28Z
"Asteroseismology of the planet-hosting star $μ$ Arae. I. The acoustic
  spectrum","We present HARPS spectroscopy of mu Arae (HD160691) performed for studying
the origin of the metallicity excess in this planet-hosting stars. The
asteroseismologic campaign led to the previously reported discovery of a 14
earth mass planetary companion (Santos et al. 2004). The present analysis
reinforces this interpretation by excluding other possible processes for
explaining the observed Doppler variation and leads to the identification of up
to 43 p-mode oscillations with l=0-3, frequencies in the range 1.3-2.5 mHz and
amplitudes in the range 10-40 cm/s.",2005-04-02T07:47:20Z
Spitzer view on the evolution of star-forming galaxies from z=0 to z~3,"We use a 24 micron selected sample containing more than 8,000 sources to
study the evolution of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range from z=0 to
z~3. We obtain photometric redshifts for most of the sources in our survey
using a method based on empirically-built templates spanning from ultraviolet
to mid-infrared wavelengths. The accuracy of these redshifts is better than 10%
for 80% of the sample. The derived redshift distribution of the sources
detected by our survey peaks at around z=0.6-1.0 (the location of the peak
being affected by cosmic variance), and decays monotonically from z~1 to z~3.
We have fitted infrared luminosity functions in several redshift bins in the
range 0<z<~3. Our results constrain the density and/or luminosity evolution of
infrared-bright star-forming galaxies. The typical infrared luminosity (L*)
decreases by an order of magnitude from z~2 to the present. The cosmic star
formation rate (SFR) density goes as (1+z)^{4.0\pm0.2} from z=0 to z=0.8. From
z=0.8 to z~1.2, the SFR density continues rising with a smaller slope. At
1.2<z<3, the cosmic SFR density remains roughly constant. The SFR density is
dominated at low redshift (z<0.5) by galaxies which are not very luminous in
the infrared (L_TIR<1.e11 L_sun, where L_TIR is the total infrared luminosity,
integrated from 8 to 1000 micron). The contribution from luminous and
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (L_TIR>1.e11 L_sun) to the total SFR density
increases steadily from z~0 up to z~2.5, forming at least half of the
newly-born stars by z~1.5. Ultraluminous infrared galaxies (L_TIR>1.e12 L_sun)
play a rapidly increasing role for z>~1.3.",2005-05-05T15:20:03Z
"Mid-infrared spectroscopy of two luminous submillimeter galaxies at
  z~2.8","Using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope,
we have obtained rest frame mid-infrared spectroscopy of two bright
submillimeter galaxies. SMMJ02399-0136 at z=2.81 shows a superposition of PAH
emission features and a mid-infrared continuum, indicating significant and
roughly equal contributions to its bolometric luminosity from star formation
and from a Compton-thick AGN. We derive a new redshift of z=2.80 for
MMJ154127+6616 from the IRS spectrum and find this object is dominated by
starburst PAH emission. The rest frame mid- to far-infrared spectral energy
distributions are consistent with these submillimeter galaxies being scaled up
versions of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The mid-infrared spectra
support the scenario that submillimeter galaxies are sites of extreme star
formation and represent a key phase in the formation of massive galaxies.",2005-04-20T07:47:01Z
The Dust Depletion and Extinction of the GRB 020813 Afterglow,"The Keck optical spectrum of the GRB 020813 afterglow is the best ever
obtained for GRBs. Its large spectral range and very high S/N ratio allowed for
the first time the detection of a vast variety of absorption lines, associated
with the circumburst medium or interstellar medium of the host. The remarkable
similarity of the relative abundances of 8 elements with the dust depletion
pattern seen in the Galactic ISM suggests the presence of dust. The derived
visual dust extinction A_V=0.40+/-0.06 contradicts the featureless UV spectrum
of the afterglow, very well described by a unreddened power law. The
forthcoming Swift era will open exciting opportunities to explain similar
phenomena in other GRB afterglows.",2005-06-02T15:54:14Z
Comparative Planetary Atmospheres: Models of TrES-1 and HD209458b,"We present new self-consistent atmosphere models for transiting planets
TrES-1 and HD209458b. The planets were recently observed with the Spitzer Space
Telescope in bands centered on 4.5 and 8.0 $\mu$m, for TrES-1, and 24 $\mu$m,
for HD209458b. We find that standard solar metallicity models fit the
observations for HD209458b. For TrES-1, which has an T_eff ~300 K cooler, we
find that models with a metallicity 3-5 times enhanced over solar abundances
can match the 1$\sigma$ error bar at 4.5 $\mu$m and 2$\sigma$ at 8.0$\mu$m.
Models with solar abundances that included energy deposition into the
stratosphere give fluxes that fall within the 2$\sigma$ error bars in both
bands. The best-fit models for both planets assume that reradiation of absorbed
stellar flux occurs over the entire planet. For all models of both planets we
predict planet/star flux ratios in other Spitzer bandpasses.",2005-05-17T20:13:27Z
Rotational modulation of X-ray emission in Orion Nebula young stars,"We investigate the spatial distribution of X-ray emitting plasma in a sample
of young Orion Nebula Cluster stars by modulation of their X-ray light-curves
due to stellar rotation. The study, part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project
(COUP), is made possible by the exceptional length of the observation: 10 days
of ACIS integration during a time span of 13 days, yielding a total of 1616
detected sources in the 17x17 arcmin field of view. We here focus on a
subsample of 233 X-ray-bright stars with known rotational periods. We search
for X-ray modulation using the Lomb Normalized Periodogram method.
  X-ray modulation related to the rotation period is detected in at least 23
stars with periods between 2 and 12 days and relative amplitudes ranging from
20% to 70%. In 16 cases, the X-ray modulation period is similar to the stellar
rotation period while in seven cases it is about half that value, possibly due
to the presence of X-ray emitting structures at opposite stellar longitudes.
These results constitute the largest sample of low mass stars in which X-ray
rotational modulation has been observed. The detection of rotational modulation
indicates that the X-ray emitting regions are distributed inhomogeneneously in
longitude and do not extend to distances significantly larger than the stellar
radius. Modulation is observed in stars with saturated activity levels
(L_X/L_bol ~ 10^(-3)) showing that saturation is not due to the filling of the
stellar surface with X-ray emitting regions.",2005-06-08T10:27:55Z
Cosmology with decaying tachyon matter,"We investigate the case of a homogeneous tachyon field coupled to gravity in
a spatially flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime. Assuming the field
evolution to be exponentially decaying with time we solve the field equations
and show that, under certain conditions, the scale factor represents an
accelerating universe, following a phase of decelerated expansion. We make use
of a model of dark energy (with p=-\rho) and dark matter (p=0) where a single
scalar field (tachyon) governs the dynamics of both the dark components. We
show that this model fits the current supernova data as well as the canonical
\LambdaCDM model. We give the bounds on the parameters allowed by the current
data.",2005-05-25T13:41:05Z
"X-Ray Emission and Optical Polarization of V1432 Aquilae: An
  Asynchronous Polar","A detailed analysis of X-ray data from ROSAT, ASCA, XMM and RXTE for the
asynchronous polar V1432 Aql along with Stokes polarimetry data from SAAO, is
presented. Power spectra from long-baseline ROSAT data show a spin period of
12150s along with several system related frequency components. However, the
second harmonic of the spin period dominates power spectrum in the XMM data.
For the optical circular polarization, the dominant period corresponds to half
the spin period. The ROSAT data can be explained as due to accretion onto two
hot spots that are not anti-podal. The variations seen in the optical
polarization and the ASCA and XMM data suggest the presence of at least three
accretion foot prints on the white dwarf surface. Two spectral models, a
multi-temperature plasma and a photo-ionized plasma model, are used for
spectral study. The RXTE PCA data are used to constrain the white dwarf mass to
1.2$\pm$0.1 M_odot using the multi-temperature plasma model. A strong soft
X-ray excess (<0.8 keV) in the XMM MOS data is well modeled by a blackbody
component having a temperature of 80-90 eV. The plasma emission lines seen at
6.7 and 7.0 keV are well fitted using the multi-temperature plasma model,
however an additional Gaussian is needed for the 6.4 keV line. The
multi-temperature plasma model requires a homogeneous absorber fully covering
the source and a partial absorber covering 65% of the source. The photo-ionized
plasma model, with a range of Fe column densities, gives a slightly better
overall fit and fits all emission lines. The presence of a strong blackbody
component, a spin period of 12150s, modulation of the 6.4 keV line flux with
spin period, and a very hard X-ray component suggest that V1432 Aql is a polar
with X-ray spectral properties similar to that of a soft intermediate polar.",2005-05-12T07:40:51Z
Detecting a small perturbation through its non-Gaussianity,"A highly non-gaussian cosmological perturbation with a flat spectrum has
unusual stochastic properties. We show that they depend on the size of the box
within which the perturbation is defined, but that for a typical observer the
parameters defining the perturbation `run' to compensate for any change in the
box size. Focusing on the primordial curvature perturbation, we show that an
un-correlated gaussian-squared component is bounded at around the 10% level by
the WMAP bound on the bispectrum, and we show that a competitive bound may
follow from the trispectrum when it too is bounded by WMAP. Similar
considerations apply to a highly non-gaussian isocurvature perturbation.",2005-04-04T15:35:25Z
Brief history of the metal accumulation in the intracluster medium,"We use models of the rates of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and core-collapse
supernovae, built in such a way that both are consistent with recent
observational constraints at z<1.6 and can reproduce the measured cosmic star
formation rate, to recover the history of the metals accumulation in the
intra-cluster medium. We show that these SN rates, in unit of SN number per
comoving volume and rest-frame year, provide on average a total amount of Iron
that is marginally consistent with the value measured in galaxy clusters in the
redshift range 0-1, and a relative evolution with redshift that is in agreement
with the observational constraints up to z~1.2. Moreover, we verify that the
predicted metals to Iron ratios reproduce the measurements obtained in nearby
clusters through X-ray analysis, implying that (1) about half of the Iron mass
and >75 per cent of the Nickel mass observed locally are produced by SN Ia
ejecta, (2) the SN Ia contribution to the metal budget decreases steeply with
redshift and by z~1 is already less than half of the local amount and (3) a
transition in the abundance ratios relative to the Iron is present between
redshifts ~0.5 and 1.4, with core-collapse SN products becoming dominant at
higher redshifts.",2005-06-13T14:31:24Z
"The Star Cluster Population of M51: III. Cluster disruption and
  formation history","In this work we concentrate on the evolution of the cluster population of the
interacting galaxy M51 (NGC 5194), namely the timescale of cluster disruption
and possible variations in the cluster formation rate. We present a method to
compare observed age vs. mass number density diagrams with predicted
populations including various physical input parameters like the cluster
initial mass function, cluster disruption, cluster formation rate and star
bursts. If we assume that the cluster formation rate increases at the moments
of the encounters with NGC 5195, we find an increase in the cluster formation
rate of a factor of 3, combined with a disruption timescale which is slightly
higher then when assuming a constant formation rate (t_4 = 200 Myr vs. 100
Myr). The measured cluster disruption time is a factor of 5 shorter than
expected on theoretical grounds. This implies that the disk of M51 is not a
preferred location for survival of young globular clusters, since even clusters
with masses of the order of 10^6 M_sun will be destroyed within a few Gyr.",2005-06-02T20:38:36Z
"UHE nuclei propagation and the interpretation of the ankle in the
  cosmic-ray spectrum","We consider the stochastic propagation of high-energy protons and nuclei in
the cosmological microwave and infrared backgrounds, using revised photonuclear
cross-sections and following primary and secondary nuclei in the full 2D
nuclear chart. We confirm earlier results showing that the high-energy data can
be fit with a pure proton extragalactic cosmic ray (EGCR) component if the
source spectrum is \propto E^{-2.6}. In this case the ankle in the CR spectrum
may be interpreted as a pair-production dip associated with the propagation. We
show that when heavier nuclei are included in the source with a composition
similar to that of Galactic cosmic-rays (GCRs), the pair-production dip is not
present unless the proton fraction is higher than 85%. In the mixed composition
case, the ankle recovers the past interpretation as the transition from GCRs to
EGCRs and the highest energy data can be explained by a harder source spectrum
\propto E^{-2.2} - E^{-2.3}, reminiscent of relativistic shock acceleration
predictions, and in good agreement with the GCR data at low-energy and holistic
scenarios.",2005-05-27T19:33:55Z
Halo Mass Profiles and Low Surface Brightness Galaxies Rotation Curves,"A recent study has claimed that the rotation curve shapes and mass densities
of Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies are largely consistent with
$\Lambda$CDM predictions, in contrast to a large body of observational work. I
demonstrate that the method used to derive this conclusion is incapable of
distinguishing the characteristic steep CDM mass-density distribution from the
core-dominated mass-density distributions found observationally: even
core-dominated pseudo-isothermal haloes would be inferred to be consistent with
CDM. This method can therefore make no definitive statements on the
(dis)agreement between the data and CDM simulations. After introducing an
additional criterion that does take the slope of the mass-distribution into
account I find that only about a quarter of the LSB galaxies investigated are
possibly consistent with CDM. However, for most of these the fit parameters are
so weakly constrained that this is not a strong conclusion. Only 3 out of 52
galaxies have tightly constrained solutions consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. Two
of these galaxies are likely dominated by stars, leaving only one possible dark
matter dominated, CDM-consistent candidate, forming a mere 2 per cent of the
total sample. These conclusions are based on comparison of data and simulations
at identical radii and fits to the entire rotation curves. LSB galaxies that
are consistent with CDM simulations, if they exist, seem to be rare indeed.",2005-06-30T11:19:24Z
"Water masers in the massive protostar IRAS 20126+4104: ejection and
  deceleration","We report on the first multi-epoch, phase referenced VLBI observations of the
water maser emission in a high-mass protostar associated with a disk-jet
system. The source under study, IRAS 20126+4104, has been extensively
investigated in a large variety of tracers, including water maser VLBA data
acquired by us three years before the present observations. The new findings
fully confirm the interpretation proposed in our previous study, namely that
the maser spots are expanding from a common origin coincident with the
protostar. We also demonstrate that the observed 3-D velocities of the maser
spots can be fitted with a model assuming that the spots are moving along the
surface of a conical jet, with speed increasing for increasing distance from
the cone vertex. We also present the results of single-dish monitoring of the
water maser spectra in IRAS 20126+4104. These reveal that the peak velocity of
some maser lines decreases linearly with time. We speculate that such a
deceleration could be due to braking of the shocks from which the maser
emission originates, due to mass loading at the shock front or dissipation of
the shock energy.",2005-04-25T14:49:21Z
Kink Stability of Isothermal Spherical Self-Similar Flow Revisited,"The problem of kink stability of isothermal spherical self-similar flow in
newtonian gravity is revisited. Using distribution theory we first develop a
general formula of perturbations, linear or non-linear, which consists of three
sets of differential equations, one in each side of the sonic line and the
other along it. By solving the equations along the sonic line we find
explicitly the spectrum, $k$, of the perturbations, whereby we obtain the
stability criterion for the self-similar solutions. When the solutions are
smoothly across the sonic line, our results reduce to those of Ori and Piran.
To show such obtained perturbations can be matched to the ones in the regions
outside the sonic line, we study the linear perturbations in the external
region of the sonic line (the ones in the internal region are identically
zero), by taking the solutions obtained along the line as the boundary
conditions. After properly imposing other boundary conditions at spatial
infinity, we are able to show that linear perturbations, satisfying all the
boundary conditions, exist and do not impose any additional conditions on $k$.
As a result, the complete treatment of perturbations in the whole spacetime
does not alter the spectrum obtained by considering the perturbations only
along the sonic line.",2005-04-20T20:04:16Z
"Isotopic abundances of carbon and nitrogen in Jupiter-family and Oort
  Cloud comets","The 12C14N/12C15N and 12C14N/13C14N isotopic ratios are determined for the
first time in a Jupiter-family comet, 88P/1981 Q1 Howell, and in the chemically
peculiar Oort Cloud comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR). By comparing these measurements
to previous ones derived for six other Oort Cloud comets (including one of
Halley-type), we find that both the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios are
constant within the uncertainties. The mean values are 12C/13C ~ 90 and 14N/15N
\~ 145 for the eight comets. These results strengthen the view that CN radicals
originate from refractory organics formed in the protosolar molecular cloud and
subsequently incorporated in comets.",2005-08-01T10:36:38Z
The XO Project: Searching for Transiting Extra-solar Planet Candidates,"The XO project's first objective is to find hot Jupiters transiting bright
stars, i.e. V < 12, by precision differential photometry. Two XO cameras have
been operating since September 2003 on the 10,000-foot Haleakala summit on
Maui. Each XO camera consists of a 200-mm f/1.8 lens coupled to a 1024x1024
pixel, thinned CCD operated by drift scanning. In its first year of routine
operation, XO has observed 6.6% of the sky, within six 7 deg-wide strips
scanned from 0 deg to +63 deg of declination and centered at RA=0, 4, 8, 12,
16, and 20 hours. Autonomously operating, XO records 1 billion pixels per clear
night, calibrates them photometrically and astrometrically, performs aperture
photometry, archives the pixel data and transmits the photometric data to STScI
for further analysis. From the first year of operation, the resulting database
consists of photometry of 100,000 stars at more than 1000 epochs per star with
differential photometric precision better than 1% per epoch. Analysis of the
light curves of those stars produces transiting-planet candidates requiring
detailed follow up, described elsewhere, culminating in spectroscopy to measure
radial-velocity variation in order to differentiate genuine planets from the
more numerous impostors, primarily eclipsing binary and multiple stars.",2005-05-27T16:57:06Z
BeppoSAX/PDS serendipitous detections at high galactic latitudes,"At a flux limit of ~10^(-11) erg/cm2/s in the 20-100 keV band, the PDS
instrument on-board BeppoSAX offers the opportunity to study the extragalactic
sky with an unprecedented sensitivity. In this work we report on the results of
a search in the BeppoSAX archive for serendipitous high energy sources at high
galactic latitudes (|b| > 13 deg). We have defined a set of twelve regions in
which the PDS/MECS cross-calibration constant is higher than the nominal value.
We attribute this mismatch to the presence of a serendipitous source in the PDS
field of view.In four cases the likely high energy emitter is also present in
the MECS field of view. In these cases, we have performed a broad band spectral
analysis (1.5-100 keV) so as to understand the source spectral behaviour and
compare it with previous BeppoSAX observations when available. In eight cases
the identification of the source likely to provide the PDS spectrum is based on
indirect evidence (extrapolation to lower energies and/or comparison to
previous observations). This approach leads to the discovery of six new hard
X-ray emitting objects (PKS 2356-611, 2MASX J14585116-1652223, NGC 1566, NGC
7319, PKS 0101-649 and ESO 025-G002) and to the presentation the PDS spectrum
of NGC 3227 for the first time. In the remaining five cases we provide extra
BeppoSAX observations that can be compared with measurements which are already
published and/or in the archive.",2005-06-10T13:28:15Z
A model for the infrared dust emission from forming galaxies,"In the early epoch of galaxy evolution, dust is only supplied by supernovae
(SNe). With the aid of a new physical model of dust production by SNe developed
by Nozawa et al. (2003) (N03), we constructed a model of dust emission from
forming galaxies on the basis of the theoretical framework of Takeuchi et al.
(2003) (T03). N03 showed that the produced dust species depends strongly on the
mixing within SNe. We treated both unmixed and mixed cases and calculated the
infrared (IR) spectral energy distribution (SED) of forming galaxies for both
cases. Our model SED is less luminous than the SED of T03 model by a factor of
2-3. The difference is due to our improved treatment of UV photon absorption
cross section, as well as different grain size and species newly adopted in
this work. The SED for the unmixed case is found to have an enhanced near to
mid-IR (N-MIR) continuum radiation in its early phase of the evolution (age <
10^{7.25} yr) compared with that for the mixed case. The strong N--MIR
continuum is due to the emission from Si grains, which only exist in the
species of the unmixed dust production. We also calculated the IR extinction
curves for forming galaxies. Then we calculated the SED of a local starbursting
dwarf galaxy SBS 0335-052. Our present model SED naturally reproduced the
strong N--MIR continuum and the lack of cold FIR emission of SBS 0335-052. We
found that only the SED of unmixed case can reproduce the NIR continuum of this
galaxy. We then made a prediction for the SED of another typical star-forming
dwarf, I Zw 18. We also presented the evolution of the SED of LBGs. Finally, we
discussed the possibility of observing forming galaxies at z > 5.",2005-06-25T13:51:33Z
Interstellar extinction towards open clusters and galactic structure,"We study the distribution of interstellar matter near the galactic plane on
the basis of open star clusters and reviewed the correlation of extinction with
different physical parameters of the clusters to understand the galactic
structure. It is seen from the extinction towards open clusters that about 90%
of the absorbing material lie within -5<b<5 deg of the galactic plane. The mean
thickness of the absorbing material, which is determined in terms of half-width
value \beta, is estimated to be about 125+/-21 pc. We show that the
interstellar absorption follows a sinusoidal variation with galactic longitude
and maximum and minimum absorptions occur at l ~ 48+/-4 deg and l ~ 228+/-4 deg
respectively. It is found that the galactic plane defined by the reddening
material is inclined by an angle of 0.6+/-0.4 deg to the formal galactic plane
and inclination is maximum at l ~ 54+/-6 deg. The reddening analysis has been
used to constrain the Solar offset which is found to be about 22.8+/-3.3 pc
above the reddening plane. We obtained a scale height of 53+/-5 pc for the
distribution of open clusters while it is 186+/-25 pc for the distribution of
reddening material from the reddening plane.",2005-07-04T14:28:14Z
"Time-resolved FUSE Photometric and Spectroscopic Observations:
  PG1219+534, PG1605+072, and PG1613+426","We report on the detection of pulsations in the far ultraviolet (hereafter
FUV) light curves of PG1219+534, PG1605+072, and PG1613+426 obtained with the
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) in time-tagged mode (TTAG).
Exposures of the order of a few Ksecs were sufficient to observe the main
frequencies of PG1219+534 and PG1605+072 and confirm the detection of a
pulsation mode at the surface of PG1613+426 as reported from ground. For the
first time we derive time-resolved spectroscopic FUSE data of a sdB pulsator
(PG1605+072) and comment its line profile variation diagram (hereafter lpv
diagram). We observe the phase shift between the maximum luminosity and the
maximum radius to be consistent with the model of an adiabatic pulsator. We
also present evidence that the line broadening previously reported is not
caused by rotation but is rather an observational bias due to the rapid Doppler
shift of the lines with 17 km.s-1 amplitude. Thus our observations do not
support the previous claim that PG1605+072 is (or will evolve into) an
unusually fast rotating degenerate dwarf. These results demonstrate the
asteroseismological potential of the FUSE satellite which should be viewed as
another powerful means of investigation of stellar pulsations along with the
MOST and COROT missions.",2005-06-27T14:30:07Z
"The location of the broad HI absorption in 3C305: clear evidence for a
  jet-accelerated neutral outflow","We present high-spatial resolution 21-cm HI VLA observations of the radio
galaxy 3C305 (z=0.041). These new high-resolution data show that the ~1000 km/s
broad HI absorption, earlier detected in low-resolution WSRT observations, is
occurring against the bright, eastern radio lobe, about 1.6 kpc from the
nucleus. We use new optical spectra taken with the WHT to make a detailed
comparison of the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen with that of the ionised
gas. The striking similarity between the complex kinematics of the two gas
phases suggests that both the ionised gas and the neutral gas are part of the
same outflow. Earlier studies of the ionised gas had already found evidence for
a strong interaction between the radio jet and the interstellar medium at the
location of the eastern radio lobe. Our results show that the fast outflow
produced by this interaction also contains a component of neutral atomic
hydrogen. The most likely interpretation is that the radio jet ionises the ISM
and accelerates it to the high outflow velocities observed. Our observations
demonstrate that, following this strong jet-cloud interaction, not all gas
clouds are destroyed and that part of the gas can cool and become neutral. The
mass outflow rate measured in 3C~305 is comparable, although at the lower end
of the distribution, to that found in Ultra-Luminous IR galaxies. This suggests
that AGN-driven outflows, and in particular jet-driven outflows, can have a
similar impact on the evolution of a galaxy as starburst-driven superwinds.",2005-05-18T07:45:59Z
"The detection of Class I methanol masers towards regions of low-mass
  star formation","Six young bipolar outflows in regions of low-to-intermediate-mass star
formation were observed in the 7_0-6_1A+, 8_0-7_1A+, and 5_{-1}-4_0E methanol
lines at 44, 95, and 84 GHz, respectively. Narrow features were detected
towards NGC 1333IRAS4A, HH 25MMS, and L1157 B1. Flux densities of the detected
lines are no higher than 11 Jy, which is much lower than the flux densities of
strong maser lines in regions of high-mass star formation. Analysis shows that
most likely the narrow features are masers.",2005-05-11T10:37:14Z
"Difficulty of detecting minihalos via $γ$-rays from dark matter
  annihilation","Analytical calculations and recent numerical experiments have shown that a
sizable of the mass in our Galaxy is in a form of clumpy, virialized
substructures that, according to \cite{dms:05}, can be as light as $10^{-6}
\msun$. In this work we estimate the gamma-rays flux expected from dark matter
annihilation occurring within these minihalos, under the hypothesis that the
bulk of dark matter is composed by neutralinos. We generate mock sky maps
showing the angular distribution of the expected gamma-ray signal. We compare
them with the sensitivities of satellite-borne experiments such as GLAST and
find that a possible detection of minihalos is indeed very challenging.",2005-05-17T19:36:00Z
"An unexpectedly rapid decline in the X-ray afterglow emission of long
  gamma-ray bursts","Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are commonly accepted to originate in the
explosion of particularly massive stars, which gives rise to a highly
relativistic jet. Internal inhomogeneities in the expanding flow give rise to
internal shock waves that are believed to produce the gamma-rays we see. As the
jet travels further outward into the surrounding circumstellar medium
`external' shocks give rise to the afterglow emission seen in the X-ray,
optical and radio bands. Here we report on the early phases of the X-ray
emission of five GRBs. Their X-ray light curves are characterised by a rapid
fall-off for the first few hundred seconds, followed by a less rapid decline
lasting several hours. This steep decline, together with detailed spectral
properties of two particular bursts, shows that violent shock interactions take
place in the early jet outflows.",2005-06-16T13:08:38Z
"A Measurement of the Angular Power Spectrum of the CMB Temperature
  Anisotropy from the 2003 Flight of Boomerang","We report on observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) obtained
during the January 2003 flight of Boomerang . These results are derived from
195 hours of observation with four 145 GHz Polarization Sensitive Bolometer
(PSB) pairs, identical in design to the four 143 GHz Planck HFI polarized
pixels. The data include 75 hours of observations distributed over 1.84% of the
sky with an additional 120 hours concentrated on the central portion of the
field, itself representing 0.22% of the full sky. From these data we derive an
estimate of the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations of the CMB
in 24 bands over the multipole range (50 < l < 1500). A series of features,
consistent with those expected from acoustic oscillations in the primordial
photon-baryon fluid, are clearly evident in the power spectrum, as is the
exponential damping of power on scales smaller than the photon mean free path
at the epoch of last scattering (l > 900). As a consistency check, the
collaboration has performed two fully independent analyses of the time ordered
data, which are found to be in excellent agreement.",2005-07-21T15:06:12Z

Observational Tests of Intergalactic Enrichment Models,"We summarize recent results assessing the carbon and silicon abundances of
the intergalactic medium (IGM) using the `pixel optical depth' technique. We
briefly discuss the implications of these results for models of intergalactic
enrichment, focusing on distinguishing `early' z >> 4 enrichment by the first
generations of stars and objects from `late' enrichment by 2 < z < 5 Ly-break
galaxies. We then discuss the comparison of observed QSO spectra to simulated
spectra generated from cosmological simulations that self-consistently include
enrichment, and draw qualitative implications for the general picture of
intergalactic enrichment at z > 2.",2005-04-19T23:19:02Z
"A Catalogue of Field Horizontal Branch Stars Aligned with High Velocity
  Clouds","We present a catalogue of 430 Field Horizontal Branch (FHB) stars, selected
from the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), which fortuitously align with high column
density neutral hydrogen (HI) High-Velocity Cloud (HVC) gas. These stars are
ideal candidates for absorption-line studies of HVCs, attempts at which have
been made for almost 40 years with little success. A parent sample of 8321 HES
FHB stars was used to extract HI spectra along each line-of-sight, using the HI
Parkes All-Sky Survey. All lines-of-sight aligned with high velocity HI
emission with peak brightness temperatures greater than 120mK were examined.
The HI spectra of these 430 probes were visually screened and cross-referenced
with several HVC catalogues. In a forthcoming paper, we report on the results
of high-resolution spectroscopic observations of a sample of stars drawn from
this catalogue.",2005-06-27T09:36:40Z
Flavoring Astrophysical Neutrinos: Flavor Ratios Depend on Energy,"Electromagnetic (and adiabatic) energy losses of pions and muons modify the
flavor ratio (measured at Earth) of neutrinos produced by pion decay in
astrophysical sources, $\Phi_{\nu_e}:\Phi_{\nu_\mu}:\Phi_{\nu_\tau}$, from
1:1:1 at low energy to 1:1.8:1.8 at high energy. The transition occurs over 1-2
decades of nuetrino energy, and is correlated with a modification of the
neutrino spectrum. For gamma-ray bursts, e.g., the transition is expected at
\~100 TeV, and may be detected by km-scale neutrino telescopes. Measurements of
the transition energy and energy-width will provide unique probes of the
physics of the sources. pion and muon energy losses also affect the ratio of
$\bar\nu_e$ flux to total neutrino flux, which may be measured at the
W-resonance (6.3 PeV): It is modified from 1/6 (1/15) at low energy to 1/9
(practically 0) at high energy for neutrinos produced in pp ($p\gamma$)
interactions.",2005-07-26T16:21:25Z
"About the correlation between solar micro bursts and the change of the
  solar wind parameters","The Sun is the closest star to our planet and it is the most studied,
perhaps, there exist too much procesess not-understood. One of the solar
processes that have a direct interaction with the earth is the solar wind. The
solar wind is defined as the plasma expulsed from the solar atmosphere, this
wind was cataloged and is considered that have three components:
  - Passive solar wind: Is the constant component of the solar wind. -
Supersonic and quasistady flux. - Sporadic supersonic flux.
  We present and brief explanation of the Parker's model of the solar wind and
a correlation analysis between solar micro radio bursts and the change of the
solar wind parameters.",2005-08-02T20:02:00Z
Discovery of pulsations in the X-ray transient 4U 1901+03,"We describe observations of the 2003 outburst of the hard-spectrum X-ray
transient 4U 1901+03 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. The outburst was
first detected in 2003 February by the All-Sky Monitor, and reached a peak
2.5-25 keV flux of 8x10^-9 ergs/cm^2/s (around 240 mCrab). The only other known
outburst occurred 32.2 yr earlier, likely the longest presently known
recurrence time for any X-ray transient. Proportional Counter Array (PCA)
observations over the 5-month duration of the 2003 outburst revealed a 2.763 s
pulsar in a 22.58 d orbit. The detection of pulsations down to a flux of
3x10^-11 ergs/cm^2/s (2.5-25 keV), along with the inferred long-term accretion
rate of 8.1x10^-11 M_sun/yr (assuming a distance of 10 kpc) suggests that the
surface magnetic field strength is below ~5x10^11 G. The corresponding
cyclotron energy is thus below 4 keV, consistent with the non-detection of
resonance features at high energies. Although we could not unambiguously
identify the optical counterpart, the lack of a bright IR candidate within the
1' RXTE error circle rules out a supergiant mass donor. The neutron star in 4U
1901+03 probably accretes from the wind of a main-sequence O-B star, like most
other high-mass binary X-ray pulsars. The almost circular orbit e=0.036
confirms the system's membership in a growing class of wide, low-eccentricity
systems in which the neutron stars may have received much smaller kicks as a
result of their natal supernova explosions.",2005-06-10T19:51:29Z
Scalar Dark Matter and Cold Stars,"In a medium composed of scalar particles with non-zero mass, the range of
Van-der-Waals-type scalar mediated interactions among nucleons becomes infinite
when the medium makes a transition to a Bose-Einstein condensed phase. We
explore this phenomenon in an astrophysical context. Namely, we study the
effect of a scalar dark matter background on the equilibrium of degenerate
stars.In particular we focus on white dwarfs and the changes induced in their
masses and in their radii.",2005-05-30T14:49:41Z
"Thermal Dust Emission from Proplyds, Unresolved Disks, and Shocks in the
  Orion Nebula","We present a new 11.7 micron mosaic image of the Orion nebula obtained with
T-ReCS on Gemini South. The map includes the BN/KL region, the Trapezium, and
OMC-1 South. Excluding BN/KL, we detect 91 point sources, with 27 known
proplyds and over 30 ``naked'' stars showing no extended structure in HST
images. Within the region we surveyed, 80 percent of known proplyds show
detectable emission, almost 40 percent of naked stars are detected at 11.7
micron, and the fraction of all visible sources with IR excess emission is
roughly 50 percent. Thermal dust emission from stars with no extended structure
in HST images means that they have dust disks comparable to the size of our
solar system. Proplyds and stars with IR excess show a clear anti-correlation
in their spatial distribution, with proplyds clustered close to theta1C, and
other infrared sources found farther away. We suspect that the clustered
proplyds trace the youngest 0.5 Myr age group associated with the Trapezium,
while the more uniformly-distributed sources trace the older 1-2 Myr population
of the ONC. This suggests that small disks persist for a few Myr in irradiated
environments, and hints that hierarchical sub-clustering has been important.
Within 30 arcsec of theta1C, all proplyds are detected at 11.7 micron. The star
theta1D is associated with the most prominent mid-IR dust arc in the nebula. We
propose that this arc is the consequence of theta1D being the closest member of
the Trapezium to the background cloud. Finally, we detect dust emission from HH
jets in Orion, including HH202, HH529, HH513, and HH514. This is the first
detection of mid-IR continuum emission from dust in the body of a collimated HH
jet or bow shock.",2005-06-20T20:00:05Z
"The Redshift Distribution of Distant Supernovae and its Use in Probing
  Reionization","We model the number of detectable supernovae (SNe) as a function of redshift
at different flux thresholds, making use of the observed properties of local
SNe, such as their lightcurves, fiducial spectra, and peak magnitude
distributions. We obtain a rate of 0.4-2.3 SNe/arcmin^2/yr at z > 5 at the near
infrared (4.5 micron) flux density threshold of 3 nJy (achievable with the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in a 10^5 s integration). In a hypothetical
one-year survey, it should be possible to detect up to several thousand SNe per
unit redshift at z > 6. We discuss the possible application of such a large
sample of distant SNe as a probe of the epoch of reionization. By heating the
intergalactic medium and raising the cosmological Jeans mass, the process of
reionization can suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies. This could have
produced a relatively sharp drop in the SNR around the redshift of
reionization. We quantify the detectability of this feature in future surveys
of distant SNe by varying the redshift and duration of the feature, as well as
its impact on the SFR in low-mass halos, which results in different redshifts,
widths, and sizes of the drop in the expected SFR. We find that the drop can be
detected out to z_re ~ 13, as long as (i) the reionization history contains a
relatively rapid feature which is synchronized over different regions to within
\Delta z < 1 - 3, (ii) the star-formation efficiency in halos that dominate
reionization is ~ 10%, and (iii) reionization significantly suppresses the star
formation in low-mass halos. Depending on the details of (i) - (iii), this
could be achieved with a survey lasting less than two weeks. Detecting this
signature would also help elucidate the feedback mechanism that regulates
reionization.",2005-05-06T19:50:00Z
Relic abundance of mass-varying cold dark matter particles,"In models of coupled dark energy and dark matter the mass of the dark matter
particle depends on the cosmological evolution of the dark energy field. In
this note we exemplify in a simple model the effects of this mass variation on
the relic abundance of cold dark matter.",2005-04-05T18:10:05Z
Constraining Cosmological Parameters by the Cosmic Inversion Method,"We investigate the question of how tightly we can constrain the cosmological
parameters by using the ``cosmic inversion'' method in which we directly
reconstruct the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations, $P(k)$,
from the temperature and polarization spectra of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). In a previous paper, we suggested that it may be possible to
constrain the cosmological parameters using the fact that the reconstructed
$P(k)$ does not depend on how many polarization data we incorporate in our
inversion procedure if and only if the correct values of the cosmological
parameters are used. The advantage of this approach is that we need no
assumption regarding the functional form of $P(k)$. In this paper, we estimate
typical errors in the determination of the cosmological parameters when our
method is applied to the PLANCK observation. We investigate constraints on $h$,
$\Omega_b$, $\Omega_m$, and $\Omega_\Lambda$ through Monte Carlo simulations.",2005-04-21T14:22:43Z
"A Statistically Robust 3-Sigma Detection of Non-Gaussianity in the WMAP
  Data Using Hot and Cold Spots","We present a careful frequentist analysis of one- and two-point statistics of
the hot and cold spots in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data obtained
by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Our main result is the
detection of a new anomaly at the 3-sigma level using temperature-weighted
extrema correlation functions. We obtain this result using a simple hypothesis
test which reduces the maximum risk of a false detection to the same level as
the claimed significance of the test. We further present a detailed study of
the robustness of our earlier claim (Larson and Wandelt 2004) under variations
in the noise model and in the resolution of the map. Free software which
implements our test is available online.",2005-05-03T19:31:11Z
"The dynamical influence of cooling in the envelope of prestellar and
  protostellar cores","We compute numerical simulations of spherical collapse triggered by a slow
increase in external pressure. We compare isothermal models to models including
cooling with a simple but self-consistent treatment of the coupling between
gas, grains and radiation field temperatures. The hydrostatic equilibrium
appears to hold past the marginally stable state, until the collapse proceeds.
The last hydrostatic state before collapse has a lower central gas temperature
in the centre due to the enhanced coupling between gas, grains and radiation
field. This results in slightly lower pressure gradients in the bulk of the
envelope which is hence slightly more extended than in the isothermal case. Due
to the sensitivity of the collapse on these initial conditions, protostellar
infall velocities in the envelope turn out to be much slower in the case with
cooling.Our models also compute the radiative transfer and a rather large
chemical network coupled to gas dynamics. However, we note that the
steady-state chemisorption of CO is sufficient to provide an accurate cooling
function of the gas. This justifies the use of post-processing techniques to
account for the abundance of observed molecules. Existing observations of
infall signatures put very stringent constraints on the kinematics and
temperature profile of the class 0 protostar IRAM 04191+1522. We show that
isothermal models fail to account for the innermost slow infall motions
observed, even with the most hydrostatic initial conditions. In contrast,
models with cooling reproduce the general shape of the temperature profile
inferred from observations and are in much better agreement with the infall
signatures in the inner 3000 AU.",2005-08-05T16:22:53Z
"On how much X-ray and UV radiation processes are coupled in accretion
  disks: AGN case","Within the standard accretion disk theory for active galactic nuclei (AGN),
the observed X-rays are often modeled by Compton up-scattering of ultraviolet
(UV) disk photons inside a hot disk corona. Here, we point out that for many
AGN, radiation pressure due to the very same UV disk photons can drive a flow
from the disk into the corona and couple the processes producing X-rays and UV
photons. This coupling could lead to quenching of the disk corona because the
regions above the UV disk will be too dense, too opaque, and consequently too
cold. We discuss various consequences of this new type of the X-ray/UV coupling
on the dynamical and radiative properties of AGN.",2005-07-06T21:39:39Z
"VLT-FORS1 Imaging Polarimetry of M83 (NGC 5236) - I. Search for Light
  Echoes from Historical Supernovae","We have used FORS1 at the ESO VLT to search for light echoes in imaging
polarimetry from four historical supernovae in the face-on nearby spiral galaxy
M83 (NGC 5236). No echoes were detected around our targets (SN 1923A, SN 1945B,
SN 1950B and SN 1957D). This implies that the interstellar medium in their
environs is rather tenuous (a few particles/cm^3), possibly as a result of
previous supernova explosions that could have cleared the immediate vicinities
of our targets. The merits and limitations of searching for light echoes in
imaging polarimetry are discussed. From the photometry of the sources detected
at the supernova locations, we estimate star cluster masses of 720, 400, 300 Mo
for the cluster progenitors of SN 1957D, SN 1923A, and SN 1950B, respectively,
and an upper limit of few tens of solar masses for SN 1945B.",2005-05-05T15:00:14Z
Stellar disk truncations at high-z: probing inside-out galaxy formation,"We have conducted a systematic search for stellar disk truncations in
disk-like galaxies at intermediate redshift (z<1.1) using the Hubble Ultra Deep
Field (UDF) data. We use the position of the truncation as a direct estimator
of the size of the stellar disk. After accounting for the surface brightness
evolution of the galaxies, our results suggest that the radial position of the
truncations has increased with cosmic time by ~1-3 kpc in the last ~8 Gyr. This
result indicates a small to moderate (~25%) inside-out growth of the disk
galaxies since z~1.",2005-07-22T09:03:06Z
"Morphologies in a Cluster of Extremely Red Galaxies with Old Stellar
  Populations at z=1.34","We have identified a clustering of red galaxies from deep optical/IR images
obtained as part of the Institute for Astronomy Deep Survey. Photometric
spectral-energy distributions indicate that most of these galaxies comprise
nearly pure old stellar populations at a redshift near 1.4, and Keck
spectroscopy of the three brightest red galaxies confirm this interpretation
and give redshifts ranging from 1.335 to 1.338. Four of the galaxies are close
together on the sky and less than 30"" from an R=13.5 star, and we have obtained
deep adaptive-optics imaging of this group. Detailed analysis and modeling of
the surface-brightness profiles of these galaxies shows that two are normal
ellipticals, one is an S0, and one appears to be an essentially pure disk of
old stars, with no significant bulge. All four are highly relaxed, symmetric
systems. While the old, bulgeless disk galaxy represents a type that is rare at
the present epoch, the other three galaxies have structural parameters that are
essentially indistinguishable from those of present-day galaxies and differ
only in the age of their stellar populations.",2005-06-29T00:45:38Z
Theoretical Isochrones with Extinction in the K Band,"We calculate theoretical isochrones in a consistent way for five filters (K,
K', Ks, F205W, and F222M) in the atmospheric window between 1.9 and 2.5 micron
using the Padova stellar evolutionary models by Girardi et al. Even when
displayed in the same Vega magnitude system, the near-infrared colors of the
same isochrone can differ by up to 0.18 mag at its bright end, depending on the
filter. We present magnitude transformations between K-band filters as a
function of color from H and K band filters. Isochrones with extinction at K of
up to 6 mag are also presented. We find that care is needed when comparing
extinction values that are estimated using different filter sets in the K band,
in particular when comparing those of atmospheric and space filter sets:
extinction values for space filters can be in error by up to 0.3 mag. To reduce
this error, we introduce an ""effective extinction slope"" for each filter set
and isochrone model, which describes the extinction behavior of isochrones in
the color-magnitude diagram more correctly than the actual extinction law. Our
calculation also suggests that the extinction law implied by the observations
of Rieke et al. for wavelengths between the H and K bands is better described
by a power-law function with an exponent of 1.61 instead of 1.55, which is
commonly used with an assumption that the transmission functions of H and K
filters are Dirac delta functions.",2005-05-05T07:10:02Z
"Spitzer Observations of CO2 Ice Towards Field Stars in the Taurus
  Molecular Cloud","We present the first Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations of the 15.2
micron bending mode of CO2 ice towards field stars behind a quiescent dark
cloud. CO2 ice is detected towards 2 field stars (Elias 16, Elias 3) and a
single protostar (HL Tau) with anabundance of ~15-20% relative to water ice.
CO2 ice is not detected towards the source with lowest extinction in our
sample, Tamura 17 (A_V = 3.9m). A comparison of the Elias 16 spectrum with
laboratory data demonstrates that the majority of CO2 ice is embedded in a
polar H2O-rich ice component, with ~15% of CO2 residing in an apolar H2O-poor
mantle. This is the first detection of apolar CO2 towards a field star. We find
that the CO2 extinction threshold is A_V = 4m +/- 1m, comparable to the
threshold for water ice, but significantly less than the threshold for CO ice,
the likely precursor of CO2. Our results confirm CO2 ice forms in tandem with
H2O ice along quiescent lines of sight. This argues for CO2 ice formation via a
mechanism similar to that responsible for H2O ice formation, viz. simple
catalytic reactions on grain surfaces.",2005-05-17T11:21:19Z
Stellar populations and Lya emission in two lensed z>~6 galaxies,"We present an analysis of two strongly lensed galaxies at z=6.56 and z ~ 7
for which multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations are available.
For one source the data include recent HST and Spitzer observations. Using an
SED fitting technique considering a number of parameters we attempt to
constrain the properties of their stellar populations and their intrinsic Lya
emission. The following main results are obtained for the individual galaxies:
* Triple arc in Abell 2218: The most likely redshift of this source is z ~
6.0-7.2. SED fits indicate generally a low extinction but do not strongly
constrain the star formation (SF) history. Best fits have typical ages of ~3 to
400 Myr. The apparent 4000Ang break observed recently from combination of
IRAC/Spitzer and HST observations, can also equally well be reproduced with the
template of a young (~3-5 Myr). The estimated SFR is typically ~1 Msun/yr, in
agreement with previous estimates. The unknowns on the age and star formation
history could easily explain the apparent absence of Lya in this galaxy. *
Abell 370 HCM 6A: The available Lya and continuum observations indicate two
possible solutions: 1) a young burst or ongoing constant SF with non-negligible
extinction or 2) a composite young+""old"" stellar population. In the first case
one obtains a best fit A_V ~ 0.5-1.8 at a 1 sigma level. In consequence we
obtain SFR ~ 11-41 Msun/yr, higher than earlier estimates, and we estimate a
fairly high total luminosity (L ~ (1-4)*10^{11} Lsun) for this galaxy, in the
range LIRG. A Lya transmission of ~23-90% is estimated from our best fit
models. Other properties remain largely unconstrained. In case of composite
stellar populations the SFR, mass, and luminosity estimate is lower. The two
scenarios may be distinguishable with IRAC/Spitzer observations at 3.6 and 4.5
micron.",2005-06-28T07:53:58Z
"Stars beyond Galaxies: The Origin of Extended Luminous Halos around
  Galaxies","(Abridged) We use numerical simulations to investigate the origin and
structure of the luminous halos that surround isolated galaxies. These stellar
structures extend out to several hundred kpc away from a galaxy, and consist of
stars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion events that
characterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies. Such origin suggests that
outer luminous halos are ubiquitous and that they should appear as an excess of
light over extrapolations of the galaxy's inner profile beyond its traditional
luminous radius. The mass profile of the accreted stellar component is well
approximated by a model where the logarithmic slope steepens monotonically with
radius; from -3 at the luminous edge of the galaxy to -4 or steeper near the
virial radius of the system. Such spatial distribution is consistent with that
of Galactic and M31 globular clusters, suggesting that many of the globulars
were brought in by accretion events, in a manner akin to the classic
Searle-Zinn scenario. The outer stellar spheroid is supported by a velocity
dispersion tensor with a substantial and radially increasing radial anisotropy.
These properties distinguish the stellar halo from the dark matter component,
which is more isotropic in velocity space, as well as from some tracers of the
outer spheroid such as satellite galaxies. Most stars in the outer halo formed
in progenitors that have since merged with the central galaxy; very few stars
in the halo are contributed by satellites that survive as self-bound entities
at the present. These features are in reasonable agreement with recent
observations of the outer halo of the MW, of M31, and of other isolated
spirals, and suggest that all of these systems underwent an early period of
active merging, as envisioned in hierarchical models of galaxy formation.",2005-06-27T19:56:00Z
XMM-Newton 13H Deep field - I. X-ray sources,"We present the results of a deep X-ray survey conducted with XMM-Newton,
centred on the UK ROSAT 13H deep field area. This region covers 0.18 deg^2 and
is the first of two areas covered with XMM-Newton as part of an extensive
multi-wavelength survey designed to study the nature and evolution of the faint
X-ray source population. We have produced detailed Monte-Carlo simulations to
obtain a quantitative characterisation of the source detection procedure and to
assess the reliability of the resultant sourcelist. We use the simulations to
establish a likelihood threshold above which we expect less than 7 (3%) of our
sources to be spurious. We present the final catalogue of 225 sources. Within
the central 9 arcmin, 68 per cent of source positions are accurate to 2 arcsec,
making optical follow-up relatively straightforward. We construct the N(>S)
relation in four energy bands: 0.2-0.5 keV, 0.5-2 keV, 2-5 keV and 5-10 keV. In
all but our highest energy band we find that the source counts can be
represented by a double powerlaw with a bright end slope consistent with the
Euclidean case and a break around 10^-14 cgs. Below this flux the counts
exhibit a flattening. Our source counts reach densities of 700, 1300, 900 and
300 deg^-2 at fluxes of 4.1x10^-16, 4.5x10^-16, 1.1x10^-15 and 5.3x10^-15 cgs
in the 0.2-0.5, 0.5-2, 2-5 and 5-10 keV energy bands respectively. We have
compared our source counts with those in the two Chandra deep fields and
Lockman hole and find our source counts to be amongst the highest of these
fields in all energy bands. We resolve >51% (>50%) of the X-ray background
emission in the 1-2 keV (2-5 keV) energy bands.",2005-07-18T18:27:49Z
Robust Reconstruction from Chopped and Nodded Images,"In ground based infrared imaging a well-known technique to reduce the
influence of thermal and background noise is chopping and nodding, where four
different signals of the same object are recorded from which the object is
reconstructed numerically. Since noise in the data can severely affect the
reconstruction, regularization algorithms have to be implemented. In this paper
we propose to combine iterative reconstruction algorithms with robust
statistical methods. Moreover, we study the use of multiple chopped data sets
with different chopping amplitudes and the according numerical reconstruction
algorithm. Numerical simulations show robustness of the proposed methods with
respect to noisy data.",2005-08-08T09:46:57Z
"Relativistic solutions to the problem of jets with time-dependent
  injection velocities","We present a ballistic description of the propagation of the working surface
of a relativistic jet. Using simple laws of conservation of mass and linear
momentum at the working surface, we obtain a full description of the jet flow
parametrised by the initial velocity and mass injection. This analysis will
soon be applied to particular cases of time-dependent injection of mass and
velocity into the jet.",2005-03-15T03:45:49Z
"Three-dimensional modeling of Type Ia supernovae - The power of late
  time spectra","Late time synthetic spectra of Type Ia supernovae, based on three-dimensional
deflagration models, are presented. We mainly focus on one
model,""c3_3d_256_10s"", for which the hydrodynamics (Roepke 2005) and
nucleosynthesis (Travaglio et al. 2004) was calculated up to the homologous
phase of the explosion. Other models with different ignition conditions and
different resolution are also briefly discussed. The synthetic spectra are
compared to observed late time spectra. We find that while the model spectra
after 300 to 500 days show a good agreement with the observed Fe II-III
features, they also show too strong O I and C I lines compared to the observed
late time spectra. The oxygen and carbon emission originates from the
low-velocity unburned material in the central regions of these models. To get
agreement between the models and observations we find that only a small mass of
unburned material may be left in the center after the explosion. This may be a
problem for pure deflagration models, although improved initial conditions, as
well as higher resolution decrease the discrepancy. The relative intensity from
the different ionization stages of iron is sensitive to the density of the
emitting iron-rich material. We find that clumping, with the presence of low
density regions, is needed to reproduce the observed iron emission, especially
in the range between 4000 and 6000 AA. Both temperature and ionization depend
sensitively on density, abundances and radioactive content. This work therefore
illustrates the importance of including the inhomogeneous nature of realistic
three-dimensional explosion models. We briefly discuss the implications of the
spectral modeling for the nature of the explosion.",2005-04-14T10:05:52Z
"An Efficient Numerical Scheme for Simulating Particle Acceleration in
  Evolving Cosmic-Ray Modified Shocks","We have developed a new, very efficient numerical scheme to solve the CR
diffusion convection equation that can be applied to the study of the nonlinear
time evolution of CR modified shocks for arbitrary spatial diffusion
properties. The efficiency of the scheme derives from its use of coarse-grained
finite momentum volumes. This approach has enabled us, using $\sim 10 - 20$
momentum bins spanning nine orders of magnitude in momentum, to carry out
simulations that agree well with results from simulations of modified shocks
carried out with our conventional finite difference scheme requiring more than
an order of magnitude more momentum points. The coarse-grained, CGMV scheme
reduces execution times by a factor approximately half the ratio of momentum
bins used in the two methods. Depending on the momentum dependence of the
diffusion, additional economies in required spatial and time resolution can be
utilized in the CGMV scheme, as well. These allow a computational speed-up of
at least an order of magnitude in some cases.",2005-06-09T18:55:48Z
"Physical Conditions in the Dwarf Local Group Irregular Galaxy IC10. I-
  Diffuse Ionized Gas","A detailed analysis on the physical conditions of the Interstellar Medium in
the main body of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10 is carried out
using long-slit spectroscopy. Maps of the excitation, the H$\alpha$ flux,
[NII]/H$\alpha$ and [SII]/H$\alpha$ are presented. The Diffuse Ionized Gas
inside the galaxy is studied. We found that the spectral characteristics are
not similar to those for spiral galaxies: the values of the ratios
[NII]/H$\alpha$ and [SII]/H$\alpha$ are not as large as in spiral galaxies but
the excitation is much larger. These values, especially the large excitation,
can be explained by proposing an extra source of ionization. Different sources
are studied but any of the models at hand could be really fitted except a
combination of photons leaking from the HII regions in addition to the
ionization provided by the WR stars present in this galaxy. Shocks are not
needed for explaining the line intensity ratios except in a small part in the
west side of the galaxy.",2005-06-24T18:37:02Z
Inflationary spectra and violations of Bell inequalities,"In spite of the macroscopic character of the primordial fluctuations, the
standard inflationary distribution (that obtained using linear mode equations)
exhibits inherently quantum properties, that is, properties which cannot be
mimicked by any stochastic distribution. This is demonstrated by a Gedanken
experiment for which certain Bell inequalities are violated. These violations
are {\it in principle} measurable because, unlike for Hawking radiation from
black holes, in inflationary cosmology we can have access to both members of
correlated pairs of modes delivered in the same state. We then compute the
effect of decoherence and show that the violations persist provided the
decoherence level (and thus the entropy) lies below a certain non-vanishing
threshold. Moreover, there exists a higher threshold above which no violation
of any Bell inequality can occur. In this regime, the distributions are
``separable'' and can be interpreted as stochastic ensembles of fluctuations.
Unfortunately, the precision which is required to have access to the quantum
properties is so high that, {\it in practice}, an observational verification
seems excluded.",2005-05-18T13:49:01Z
"Extragalactic Globular Clusters: Old Spectroscopic Ages and New Views on
  Their Formation","We present the results of a meta-analysis of Keck spectra of extragalactic
globular clusters (GCs) in a sample of eight galaxies, ranging from dwarfs to
massive ellipticals. We infer ages for the metal-poor and metal-rich GCs in
these galaxies through comparisons to Galactic GCs. Both subpopulations appear
to be no younger than their Galactic counterparts, with ages ~> 10 Gyr. This is
the largest sample of galaxies for which ages have been constrained
spectroscopically. Our results support the formation of most GCs in massive
galaxies at high redshift. We propose a scenario for the formation of GC
subpopulations that synthesizes aspects of both accretion and in situ
approaches in the context of galaxy formation through hierarchical merging.",2005-06-13T20:00:01Z
The thinnest cold HI clouds in the diffuse interstellar medium?,"We confirm and discuss recently discovered cold HI clouds with column
densities among the lowest ever detected. The column densities of Cold Neutral
Medium (CNM) towards 3C286 and 3C287 are ~10^18 cm^-2, below an observational
lower limit, and also below tiny-scale-atomic clouds detected by VLBI and
time-variable profiles against pulsars. These column densities are close to the
minimum imposed by thermal evaporation. The fractions of the CNM to total HI
towards 3C286 and 3C287 are ~4% and <2%, respectively. We discuss the CNM
fraction and the CNM clouds in relation to several theoretical models.",2005-05-05T19:14:39Z
Secular Evolution in Mira Variable Pulsations,"Stellar evolution theory predicts that asymptotic giant branch stars undergo
a series of short thermal pulses that significantly change their luminosity and
mass on timescales of hundreds to thousands of years. Secular changes in these
stars resulting from thermal pulses can be detected as measurable changes in
period if the star is undergoing Mira pulsations. The American Association of
Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) International Database currently contains
visual data for over 1500 Mira variables. Light curves for these stars span
nearly a century in some cases, making it possible to study the secular
evolution of the pulsation behavior on these timescales. In this paper, we
present the results of our study of period change in 547 Mira variables using
data from the AAVSO. We find non-zero rates of period change, dlnP/dt, at the
2-sigma significance level in 57 of the 547 stars, at the 3-sigma level in 21
stars, and at the level of 6-sigma or greater in eight of the 547. The latter
eight stars have been previously noted in the literature, and our derived rates
of period changes largely agree with published values. The largest and most
statistically significant dlnP/dt are consistent with the rates of period
change expected during thermal pulses on the AGB. A number of other stars
exhibit non-monotonic period changes on decades-long timescales, the cause of
which is not yet known.",2005-04-24T13:11:52Z
Do Large-Scale Inhomogeneities Explain Away Dark Energy?,"Recently, new arguments (astro-ph/0501152, hep-th/0503117) for how
corrections from super-Hubble modes can explain the present-day acceleration of
the universe have appeared in the literature. However, in this letter, we argue
that, to second order in spatial gradients, these corrections only amount to a
renormalization of local spatial curvature, and thus cannot account for the
negative deceleration. Moreover, cosmological observations already put severe
bounds on such corrections, at the level of a few percent, while in the context
of inflationary models, these corrections are typically limited to ~ 10^{-5}.
Currently there is no general constraint on the possible correction from higher
order gradient terms, but we argue that such corrections are even more
constrained in the context of inflationary models.",2005-03-25T01:31:33Z
"Fully Degenerate Self-Gravitating Fermionic Dark Matter: Implications to
  the Density Profile of the Cluster of Galaxies A1689, and the Mass Hierarchy
  of Black Holes","Equilibrium configurations of weakly interacting fully degenerate fermionic
dark matter are considered at various scales in the Universe. We treat the
general situations for the gravity from Newtonian to general relativity and the
degeneracy from nonrelativistic to relativistic. A dimensionless equilibrium
configuration is specified by a single parameter regardless of particle
properties, the Fermi velocity at the center, and the scalings of mass and
length are specified by the rest mass and statistical weight of the dark matter
particle. We focus our attention to the flat-top nature of the mass column
density profile of the cluster of galaxies, A1689, recently reported by
Broadhurst et al. using gravitational lensing. We convert the column density
profile to a volume density profile assuming spherical symmetry and derive a 3D
encircled mass profile of A1689, which is compared with the model profiles of
degenerate fermion structures. The flat-top profile is reproduced. The
corresponding fermion mass ranges from 2 eV to 30 eV depending on the actual
scale of the degenerate structure. If massive neutrinos are the dominant dark
matter, the rest mass will be about 4.7 or 2.3 eV respectively for Majorana or
Dirac neutrinos. The mass and size of the degenerate structure are
$10^{14}M_\odot$ and 100 kpc for Majorana neutrinos, and
5$\times10^{14}M_\odot$ and 300 kpc for Dirac neutrinos. If we identify the
fermions as heavier sterile neutrinos, they yield the characteristic mass
hierarchy of black holes; giant black hole at the center of a galaxy and the
intermediate mass black holes. Thus we propose the possibility that the mass
hierarchy of fermions determines that of black holes in the Universe.",2005-06-25T10:11:14Z
Observation of small scale structure using sextupole lensing,"Weak gravitational lensing seeks to determine shear by measuring induced
quadrupole (elliptical) shapes in background galaxy images. Small impact
parameter (a few kpc) gravitational lensing by foreground core masses between 2
10^{9} and 2 10^{12} M_\odot will additionally induce a sextupole shape with
the quadrupole and sextupole minima aligned. This correlation in relative
orientation of the quadrupole and sextupole provides a sensitive method to
identify images which have been slightly curved by lensing events. A general
theoretical framework for sextupole lensing is developed which includes several
low order coefficients in a general lensing map. Tools to impute map
coefficients from the galaxy images are described and applied to the north
Hubble deep field. Instrumental PSFs, camera charge diffusion, and image
composition methods are modelled in the coefficient determination process.
Estimates of Poisson counting noise for each galaxy are used to cut galaxies
with signals too small to reliably establish curvature. Curved galaxies are
found to be spatially clumped, as would be expected if the curving were due to
small impact parameter lensing by localized ensembles of dark matter haloes.
Simulations provide an estimate of the total required lensing mass and the
acceptable mass range of the constituent haloes. The overdensities and
underdensities of visible galaxies and their locations in the Hubble foreground
is found to be consistent with our observations and their interpretation as
lensing events.",2005-04-08T19:51:11Z
"Near-UV Observations of CS29497-030: New Constraints on Neutron-Capture
  Nucleosynthesis Processes","Employing spectra obtained with the new Keck I HIRES near-UV sensitive
detector, we have performed a comprehensive chemical composition analysis of
the binary blue metal-poor star CS29497-030. Abundances for 29 elements and
upper limits for an additional seven have been derived, concentrating on
elements largely produced via neutron-capture nucleosynthesis. Included in our
analysis are the two elements that define the termination point of the slow
neutron-capture process, lead and bismuth. We determine an extremely high value
of [Pb/Fe] = +3.65 +/- 0.07 (sigma = 0.13) from three features, supporting the
single-feature result obtained in previous studies. We also detect Bi for the
first time in a metal-poor star. Our derived Bi/Pb ratio is in accord with
those predicted from the most recent FRANEC calculations of the slow
neutron-capture process in low-mass AGB stars. We find that the neutron-capture
elemental abundances of CS29497-030 are best explained by an AGB model that
also includes very significant amounts of pre-enrichment of rapid
neutron-capture process material in the protostellar cloud out of which the
CS29497-030 binary system formed. Thus, CS29497-030 is both an ``r+s'' and
``extrinsic AGB'' star. Furthermore, we find that the mass of the AGB model can
be further constrained by the abundance of the light odd-element [Na/Fe] which
is sensitive to the neutron excess.",2005-04-29T22:45:35Z
Spin-Induced Disk Precession in Sagittarius A*,"In Sgr A* at the Galactic center, by far the closest and easiest supermassive
black hole we can study, the observational evidence is increasingly pointing to
the presence of a compact, hot, magnetized disk feeding the accretor. In such
low-Mach-number plasmas, forces arising, e.g., from pressure gradients in the
plasma, can altogether negate the warping of disks around Kerr black holes
caused by the Bardeen-Petterson effect and can lead to coherent precession of
the entire disk. In this Letter, we present for the first time highly detailed
3D SPH simulations of the accretion disk evolution in Sgr A*, guided by
observational constraints on its physical characteristics, and conclude that
indeed the Bardeen-Petterson effect is probably absent in this source. Given
what we now understand regarding the emission geometry in this object, we
suggest that a ~ 50-500-day modulation in Sgr A*'s spectrum, arising from the
disk precession, could be an important observational signature; perhaps the ~
106-day period seen earlier in its radio flux, if confirmed, could be due to
this process. On the other hand, if future observations do not confirm this
long modulation in Sgr A*'s spectrum, this would be an indication that either
the disk size or orientation is very different from current estimates, or that
the black hole is not spinning at all (unlikely), or that our current
understanding of how it produces its radiative output is incorrect.",2005-07-12T21:12:08Z
Kaon condensation in the quark-meson coupling model and compact stars,"The properties of neutron stars constituted of a crust of hadrons and an
internal part of hadrons and kaon condensate are calculated within the
quark-meson-coupling model. We have considered stars with nucleons only in the
hadron phase and also stars with hyperons as well. The results are compared
with the ones obtained from the non-linear Walecka model for the hadronic
phase.",2005-06-09T09:38:55Z
"Early optical-IR emission from GRB 041219a: neutron-rich internal shocks
  and a mildly magnetized external reverse shock","Very early optical and near infrared (IR) emission was discovered
accompanying the long gamma-ray burst (GRB) 041219a. We show that the
optical/IR flash tracking the gamma-ray lightcurve during the prompt emission
could be understood as emission from neutron-rich internal shocks, as has been
suggested by Fan & Wei. The early K_s-band afterglow lightcurve after the
prompt phase could be well-modeled as the superposition of a reverse shock and
a forward shock component. The radio data also support the reverse shock
interpretation.",2005-04-06T22:36:48Z
The Impact of Hydrodynamic Mixing on Supernova Progenitors,"Recent multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated the
importance of hydrodynamic motions in the convective boundary and radiative
regions of stars to transport of energy, momentum, and composition. The impact
of these processes increases with stellar mass. Stellar models which
approximate this physics have been tested on several classes of observational
problems. In this paper we examine the implications of the improved treatment
on supernova progenitors. The improved models predict substantially different
interior structures. We present pre-supernova conditions and simple explosion
calculations from stellar models with and without the improved mixing treatment
at 23 solar masses. The results differ substantially.",2005-07-05T18:23:24Z
Exploring the Hard X-/soft gamma-ray Continuum Spectra with Laue Lenses,"The history of X-ray astronomy has shown that any advancement in our
knowledge of the X-ray sky is strictly related to an increase in instrument
sensitivity. At energies above 60 keV, there are interesting prospects for
greatly improving the limiting sensitivity of the current generation of direct
viewing telescopes (with or without coded masks), offered by the use of Laue
lenses. We will discuss below the development status of a Hard X-Ray focusing
Telescope (HAXTEL) based on Laue lenses with a broad bandpass (from 60 to 600
keV) for the study of the X-ray continuum of celestial sources. We show two
examplesof multi-lens configurations with expected sensitivity orders of
magnitude better ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-8}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$
at 200 keV) than that achieved so far. With this unprecedented sensitivity,
very exciting astrophysical prospects are opened.",2005-07-07T15:44:57Z
High-Energy Cosmic Rays and Neutrinos from Gamma-Ray Bursts,"A complete model for the origin of high-energy >~10^{14} eV) cosmic rays from
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and implications of this hypothesis are described.
Detection of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs provide an unambiguous test of the
model. Evidence for cosmic-ray acceleration in GRBs is suggested by the
detection of anomalous gamma-ray components such as that observed from GRB
941017. Neutron beta-decay halos around star-forming galaxies such as the Milky
Way are formed as a consequence of this model. Cosmic rays from GRBs in the
Galaxy are unlikely to account for the ~10^{18} eV cosmic-ray excess reported
by the Sydney University Giant Air Shower Recorder (SUGAR), but could
contribute to past extinction events.",2005-06-16T17:37:03Z
"The first chemical enrichment in the universe and the formation of hyper
  metal-poor stars","The recent discovery of a hyper metal-poor (HMP) star, whose metallicity Fe/H
is smaller than 1/100,000 of the solar ratio, together with one earlier HMP
star, has raised a challenging question if these HMP stars are the actual first
generation, low mass stars in the Universe. We argue that these HMP stars are
the second generation stars being formed from gases which were chemically
enriched by the first generation supernovae. The key to this solution is the
very unusual abundance patterns of these HMP stars with important similarities
and differences. We can reproduce these abundance features with the
core-collapse ``faint'' supernova models which undergo extensive matter mixing
and fallback during the explosion.",2005-05-26T01:00:10Z

"Corrections of Errors in `The First Detections of the Extragalactic
  Background Light at 3000, 5500, and 8000 Å. I, II, and III'","We correct errors in Bernstein, Freedman & Madore (2002abc), a series of
papers in which we described observations of the optical extragalactic
background light (EBL). These errors pertain to the measurement of zodiacal
light, given in the second paper of this series. Making these corrections leads
to a net decrease of 0.5($\pm$0.6)% in our zodiacal light measurement and a
corresponding increase in the inferred extragalactic background light of
roughly $0.5 (\pm 0.6) \times 10^{-9}$ ergs sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$
\AA$^{-1}$. For comparison, the originally--quoted EBL flux at 5500\AA was $2.7
(\pm1.4) \times 10^{-9}$ in the same units ($1\sigma$ combined systematic and
statistical uncertainty). We provide a detailed discussion of these errors and
also discuss the evolution of this work prior to the (2002) papers. We note
that corrections of the factual errors in our (2002) papers yield a result that
is consistent with the results and errors quoted there. However, this is not
intended to be a new or updated analysis, and it does not address some
methodological objections which have been raised to our prior work.",2005-07-01T16:52:09Z
Further Wolf-Rayet stars in the starburst cluster Westerlund 1,"We present new low and intermediate-resolution spectroscopic observations of
the Wolf Rayet (WR) star population in the massive starburst cluster Westerlund
1. Finding charts are presented for five new WRs - four WNL and one WCL -
raising the current total of known WRs in the cluster to 19. We also present
new spectra and correct identifications for the majority of the 14 WR stars
previously known, notably confirming the presence of two WNVL stars. Finally we
briefly discuss the massive star population of Westerlund 1 in comparison to
other massive young galactic clusters.",2005-03-14T21:22:51Z
Gravoturbulent formation of planetesimals,"We explore the effect of magnetorotational turbulence on the dynamics and
concentrations of boulders in local box simulations of a sub-Keplerian
protoplanetary disc. The solids are treated as particles each with an
independent space coordinate and velocity. We find that the turbulence has two
effects on the solids. 1) Meter and decameter bodies are strongly concentrated,
locally up to a factor 100 times the average dust density, whereas decimeter
bodies only experience a moderate density increase. The concentrations are
located in large scale radial gas density enhancements that arise from a
combination of turbulence and shear. 2) For meter-sized boulders, the
concentrations cause the average radial drift speed to be reduced by 40%. We
find that the densest clumps of solids are gravitationally unstable under
physically reasonable values for the gas column density and for the dust-to-gas
ratio due to sedimentation. We speculate that planetesimals can form in a dust
layer that is not in itself dense enough to undergo gravitational
fragmentation, and that fragmentation happens in turbulent density fluctuations
in this sublayer.",2005-04-28T09:55:18Z
"VLBA Identification of the Milliarcsecond Active Nucleus in the Seyfert
  Galaxy NGC 4151","The Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 has been imaged at resolution better than 0.1 pc
using a VLBI array consisting of the VLBA and three 100m-class telescopes. A
flat-spectrum 3-mJy source with a monochromatic radio power of ~10^{37} ergs/s
has been detected, apparently at the location of the active galactic nucleus
(AGN) and its central black hole. The radio source has a minimum brightness
temperature of 2.1 x 10^8 K and a size upper limit of 0.035 pc, about 10 times
the diameter of the broad-line region and 15,000 times the diameter of the
black hole's event horizon. An additional flat-spectrum component located
within a parsec of the apparent nucleus is likely to be a knot in the inner
radio jet. The presence of some steep-spectrum radio emission within 0.1 pc of
the galaxy nucleus limits the emission measure of a possible ionized torus to a
maximum value of 10^8 cm^{-6}pc. If the hard X-ray source in NGC 4151 is
associated with the radio AGN, its radio to X-ray ratio is less than 10^{-5},
putting NGC 4151 securely in the radio-quiet class of AGNs. The radio image
reveals a 0.2 pc two-sided base to the well-known arcsecond radio jet. Apparent
speeds of jet components relative to the radio AGN are <0.050c and <0.028c at
respective nuclear distances of 0.16 pc and 6.8 pc. These are the lowest speed
limits yet found for a Seyfert galaxy, and indicate non-relativistic jet
motions, possibly due to thermal plasma, on a scale only an order of magnitude
larger than the broad-line region.",2005-05-07T04:53:30Z
"GRBs Optical follow-up observation at Lulin observatory, Taiwan","The Lulin GRB program, using the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) in Taiwan

Likelihood Estimation of Gamma Ray Bursts Duration Distribution,"Two classes of Gamma Ray Bursts have been identified so far, characterized by
T90 durations shorter and longer than approximately 2 seconds. It was shown
that the BATSE 3B data allow a good fit with three Gaussian distributions in
log T90. In the same Volume in ApJ. another paper suggested that the third
class of GRBs is may exist. Using the full BATSE catalog here we present the
maximum likelihood estimation, which gives us 0.5% probability to having only
two subclasses. The MC simulation confirms this probability.",2005-06-15T06:55:51Z
"Observations Supporting the Existence of an Intrinsic Magnetic Moment
  Inside the Central Compact Object Within the Quasar Q0957+561","Recent auto-correlation and fluctuation analysis of time series data in the
brightness curves and micro-lensing size scales seen in Q0957+561 A,B has
produced important information about the existence and characteristic physical
dimensions of a new non-standard internal structure contained within this
quasar. We find that the new internal quasar structure, which we shall call the
Schild-Vakulik Structure, can be consistently explained in terms of a new class
of gravitationally collapsing solutions to the Einstein field equations which
describe highly redshifted, Eddington limited, Magnetospheric Eternally
Collapsing Objects (MECO) that contain intrinsic magnetic moments. Since
observation of the Schild-Vakulik structure within Q0957+561 implies that this
quasar contains an observable intrinsic magnetic moment, this represents strong
evidence that this quasar does not have an event horizon",2005-05-25T17:37:09Z
The pressure distribution in thermally bistable turbulent flows,"We present a systematic numerical study of the effect of turbulent velocity
fluctuations on the thermal pressure distribution in thermally bistable flows.
The simulations employ a random turbulent driving generated in Fourier space
rather than star-like heating. The turbulent fluctuations are characterized by
their rms Mach number M and the energy injection wavenumber, k_for. Our results
are consistent with the picture that as either of these parameters is
increased, the local ratio of turbulent crossing time to cooling time
decreases, causing transient structures in which the effective behavior is
intermediate between the thermal-equilibrium and adiabatic regimes. As a
result, the effective polytropic exponent gamma_ef ranges between ~0.2 to ~1.1.
The fraction of high-density zones with P>10^4 Kcm^-3 increases from roughly
0.1% at k_for=2 and M=0.5 to roughly 70% for k_for=16 and M=1.25. A preliminary
comparison with the pressure measurements of Jenkins (2004) favors our case
with M=0.5 and k_for=2. In all cases, the dynamic range of the pressure summed
over the entire density range, typically spans 3-4 orders of magnitude. The
total pressure histogram widens as the Mach number is increased, and develops
near-power-law tails at high (resp.low) pressures when gamma_ef<~ 0.5 (resp.
gamma_ef>~ 1), which occurs at k_for=2 (resp.k_for=16) in our simulations. The
opposite side of the pressure histogram decays rapidly, in an approx. lognormal
form. Our results show that turbulent advection alone can generate large
pressure scatters, with power-law high-P tails for large-scale driving, and
provide validation for approaches attempting to derive the shape of the
pressure histogram through a change of variable from the known form of the
density histogram, such as that performed by MacLow et al.(2004).",2005-04-20T16:27:26Z
"The X-ray binary population in M33: I. Source list and luminosity
  function","In this paper we present the source list for 3 Chandra observations of the
Local Group galaxy M33. The observations are centered on the nucleus and on the
star forming region NGC 604. We detect a total of 261 sources in an area of
\~0.2 square degree down to a flux limit of 3*10^{-16} erg/s/cm^2 which
corresponds to a luminosity of ~2*10^34 erg/s at a distance of 840 kpc. From
the source list we construct the luminosity functions of sources observed in
M33. Taking into account background contamination the luminosity functions are
consistent with those of other star forming galaxies. In addition, the
combination of X-ray color analysis and the existence of ``blue'' optical
counterparts strongly indicate that the X-ray point source population in M33
consists of young objects. Above 3*10^35 erg/s there are few X-ray sources in

"Physical Conditions in the Dwarf Local Group Irregular Galaxy IC10. I-
  Diffuse Ionized Gas","A detailed analysis on the physical conditions of the Interstellar Medium in
the main body of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10 is carried out
using long-slit spectroscopy. Maps of the excitation, the H$\alpha$ flux,
[NII]/H$\alpha$ and [SII]/H$\alpha$ are presented. The Diffuse Ionized Gas
inside the galaxy is studied. We found that the spectral characteristics are
not similar to those for spiral galaxies: the values of the ratios
[NII]/H$\alpha$ and [SII]/H$\alpha$ are not as large as in spiral galaxies but
the excitation is much larger. These values, especially the large excitation,
can be explained by proposing an extra source of ionization. Different sources
are studied but any of the models at hand could be really fitted except a
combination of photons leaking from the HII regions in addition to the
ionization provided by the WR stars present in this galaxy. Shocks are not
needed for explaining the line intensity ratios except in a small part in the
west side of the galaxy.",2005-06-24T18:37:02Z
511 KeV photons from superconducting cosmic strings,"We show that a tangle of light superconducting strings in the Milky Way could
be the source of the observed 511 KeV emission from electron-positron
annihilation in the Galactic bulge. The scenario predicts a flux that is in
agreement with observations if the strings are at the ~ 1 TeV scale making the
particle physics within reach of planned accelerator experiments. The emission
is directly proportional to the galactic magnetic field and future observations
should be able to differentiate the superconducting string scenario from other
proposals.",2005-05-03T20:00:34Z
"Multi-seeded multi-mode formation of embedded clusters in the RMC:
  Clusters baked in swept-up shells","This is the first of a series of three papers on clustered star formation in
the Rosette Molecular Complex. Here we investigate star formation in the
interfacing layers between the expanding Rosette Nebula and its surrounding
cloud, based on an analysis of the spatially complete and unbiased 2MASS data.
Two medium-mass infrared clusters with ages of around 1 Myr are identified in
the south and south-east arcs of the fragmented shell. The majority of the
candidate cluster members in these radiation and pressure-confined regions are
found to be almost uniformly distributed, roughly following the compression
layers traced by the distribution of optical depth at 100 $\mu$m, and may well
develop into gravitationally unbound systems upon their emergence from the
parental cloud. These expanding shells are believed to be playing important
roles in impeding the emerging young open cluster NGC 2244 from intruding
immediately and deeply into the ambient molecular cloud, where sequential
formation of massive clusters is taking place.",2005-04-01T08:14:35Z
The Lithium Content of the Galactic Halo Stars,"Thanks to the accurate determination of the baryon density of the universe by
the recent cosmic microwave background experiments, updated predictions of the
standard model of Big Bang nucleosynthesis now yield the initial abundance of
the primordial light elements with an unprecedented precision. In the case of
$^7$Li, the CMB+SBBN value is significantly higher than the generally reported
abundances for Pop II stars along the so-called Spite plateau. In view of the
crucial importance of this disagreement which has cosmological, galactic and
stellar implications, we decided to tackle the most critical issues of the
problem by revisiting a large sample of literature Li data in halo stars that
we assembled following some strict selection criteria on the quality of the
original analyses. [Abridged]",2005-05-12T10:11:58Z
"Color--Magnitude Diagrams and Luminosity Functions down to the Hydrogen
  Burning Limit. III. A Preliminary HST Study of NGC6791","Using HST ACS/WFC images, we derive the color--magnitude diagram of the old,
metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791 to nearly 29th magnitude in V, which is the
neighborhood of the hydrogen-burning limit.Comparison with isochrones leads to
a discussion of the distance modulus, the reddening, and the age of the
cluster. By making a statistical correction for field stars we derive a
preliminary luminosity function, and a very tentative mass function. The white
dwarf sequence is clearly shown, and has been discussed in a separate paper.",2005-04-28T09:32:13Z
"X-Ray Spectra of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxy Ton S180 in Comparison
  with Galactic Black Holes","An analysis was made of 0.3-15 keV X-ray spectra of a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
Galaxy, Ton S180, using archival data from ASCA, RXTE, and XMM-Newton. At
energies above 2.5 keV, a power-law with a photon index of ~ 2.3 successfully
and consistently reproduced the spectra from all of these observatories.
Assuming this power-law component to extend toward lower energies, a soft
excess, which is one of the most remarkable features of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
Galaxies, is explained by another power-law multiplied by a thermal cutoff at ~
0.4 keV. Some similarities have been observed between this object and Galactic
black hole binaries in very high state, the latter being realized under high
accretion rates. Attempts have been made to interpret the soft excess in terms
of Comptonization of the disk photons by an electron cloud surrounding the
accretion disk, like BHBs in a very high state.",2005-04-05T09:17:32Z
Core and Conal Component Analysis of Pulsar B1237+25,"The paper provides a new analysis of this famous five-component ({\bf M})
pulsar. In addition to the star's core-active ``abnormal'' mode, we find two
distinct behaviors within its ``normal'' mode, a ``quiet-normal'' mode with
regular 2.8-period subpulse modulation and little or no core activity, and a
``flare-normal'' mode, where the core is regularly bright and a nearly 4-period
modulation is maintained. The ``flare-normal'' mode appears to be an
intermediate state between the ``quiet normal'' and ``abnormal'' behaviors.
Short 5--15-pulse ``flare-normal''-mode ``bursts'' and ``quiet normal''
intervals alternate with each other quasi-periodically, making a cycle some
60--80 pulses in duration. ``Abnormal''-mode intervals are interspersed within
this overall cycle, usually persisting for only a few pulses, but occasionally
lasting for scores or even many hundreds of pulses. Within subsequences where
the core is exceptionally quiet, the pulsar provides a nearly ``textbook''
example of a central PA sightline traverse--with a PA rate measured to be at
least some 180$\deg/\deg$. On this basis it is shown that the sightline impact
angle $\beta$ must be about 0.25\degr or some 5% of the outer conal beam
radius. The star's core component is found to be incomplete, despite the fact
that the core's full antisymmetric circularly polarized signature is present.
We find that the star's PA traverse is disrupted through the action of
orthogonally polarized linear power in the longitude range of the core
component. This behavior is modeled to show its effect. Finally, the star
provides two well defined fiducial points from which emission-height estimates
can be computed, the respective centers of both the linear PA traverse and the
zero-crossing point of the circular polarization signature.",2005-06-30T20:56:02Z
"The nature of Composite Seyfert/Star-forming galaxies revealed by X-ray
  observations","This paper presents new Chandra and BeppoSAX observations aimed at
investigating the optical/X-ray mismatch in the enigmatic class of the
Composite galaxies, discovered by a cross-correlation of IRAS and ROSAT all sky
survey catalogues. These galaxies have been classified as star-forming objects
on the basis of their optical spectra, while the detection of weak broad wings
in the H(alpha) emission in a few of them and their high X-ray luminosity in
the ROSAT band indicated the presence of an active nucleus. The analysis of
Chandra observations for 4 Composites has revealed nuclear point-like sources,
with a typical AGN spectrum (Gamma = 1.7-1.9) and little intrinsic absorption.
A strong flux variability has been observed on different time scales, in
particular most of the sources were brighter at the ROSAT epoch. Although of
relative low luminosity for the AGN class (L(2-10 keV) = 3-60 x 10^{41} erg/s),
the active nucleus is nevertheless dominant in the X-ray domain. At other
wavelengths it appears to be overwhelmed by the starburst and/or host galaxy
light, yielding the Composite classification for these objects.",2005-06-06T13:13:40Z
"The Evolution of the Optical and Near-Infrared Galaxy Luminosity
  Functions and Luminosity Densities to z~2","Using Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based U through K- band photometry
from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), we measure the
evolution of the luminosity function and luminosity density in the rest-frame
optical (UBR) to z ~ 2, bridging the poorly explored ``redshift desert''
between z~1 and z~2. We also use deep near-infrared observations to measure the
evolution in the rest-frame J-band to z~1. Compared to local measurements from
the SDSS, we find a brightening of the characteristic magnitude, (M*), by ~2.1,
\~0.8 and ~0.7 mag between z=0.1 and z=1.9, in U, B, and R bands, respectively.
The evolution of M* in the J-band is in the opposite sense, showing a dimming
between redshifts z=0.4 and z=0.9. This is consistent with a scenario in which
the mean star formation rate in galaxies was higher in the past, while the mean
stellar mass was lower, in qualitative agreement with hierarchical galaxy
formation models. We find that the shape of the luminosity function is strongly
dependent on spectral type and that there is strong evolution with redshift in
the relative contribution from the different spectral types to the luminosity
density.
  We find good agreement in the luminosity function derived from an R-selected
and a K-selected sample at z~1, suggesting that optically selected surveys of
similar depth (R < 24) are not missing a significant fraction of objects at
this redshift relative to a near-infrared-selected sample. We compare the
rest-frame B-band luminosity functions from z~0--2 with the predictions of a
semi-analytic hierarchical model of galaxy formation, and find qualitatively
good agreement. In particular, the model predicts at least as many optically
luminous galaxies at z~1--2 as are implied by our observations.",2005-05-13T19:54:06Z
The Compression of Dark Matter Halos by Baryonic Infall,"The initial radial density profiles of dark matter halos are laid down by
gravitational collapse in hierarchical structure formation scenarios and are
subject to further compression as baryons cool and settle to the halo centers.
We here describe an explicit implementation of the algorithm, originally
developed by Young, to calculate changes to the density profile as the result
of adiabatic infall in a spherical halo model. Halos with random motion are
more resistant to compression than are those in which random motions are
neglected, which is a key weakness of the simple method widely employed.
Young's algorithm results in density profiles in excellent agreement with those
from N-body simulations. We show how the algorithm may be applied to determine
the original uncompressed halos of real galaxies, a step which must be computed
with care in order to enable a confrontation with theoretical predictions from
theories such as LCDM.",2005-07-26T18:17:22Z
"A Statistically Robust 3-Sigma Detection of Non-Gaussianity in the WMAP
  Data Using Hot and Cold Spots","We present a careful frequentist analysis of one- and two-point statistics of
the hot and cold spots in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data obtained
by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Our main result is the
detection of a new anomaly at the 3-sigma level using temperature-weighted
extrema correlation functions. We obtain this result using a simple hypothesis
test which reduces the maximum risk of a false detection to the same level as
the claimed significance of the test. We further present a detailed study of
the robustness of our earlier claim (Larson and Wandelt 2004) under variations
in the noise model and in the resolution of the map. Free software which
implements our test is available online.",2005-05-03T19:31:11Z
Cosmology with Gamma Ray Bursts,"Apparently, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are all but standard candles. Their
emission is collimated into a cone and the received flux depends on the cone
aperture angle. Fortunately we can derive the aperture angle through an
achromatic steepening of the lightcurve of the afterglow, and thus we can
measure the ""true"" energetics of the prompt emission. Ghirlanda et al. (2004)
found that this collimation-corrected energy correlates tightly with
thefrequency at which most of the radiation of the prompt is emitted. Through
this correlation we can infer the burst energy accurately enough for a
cosmological use. Using the best known 15 GRBs we find very encouraging results
that emphasize the cosmological GRB role. Probing the universe with high
accuracy up to high redshifts, GRBs establish a new insight on the cosmic
expanding acceleration history and accomplish the role of ""missing link""
between the Cosmic Microwave Background and type Ia supernovae, motivating the
most optimistic hopes for what can be obtained from the bursts detected by
SWIFT.",2005-04-13T20:02:11Z
"Fluorine Abundance Variations in Red Giants of the Globular Cluster M4
  and Early-Cluster Chemical Pollution","We present fluorine abundances in seven red-giant members of the globular
cluster M4 (NGC 6121). These abundances were derived from the HF (1--0) R9 line
at 2.3357 microns in high-resolution infrared spectra obtained with the Phoenix
spectrograph on Gemini-South. Many abundances in the target stars have been
studied previously, so that their overall abundance distributions are
well-mapped. The abundance of fluorine is found to vary by more than a factor
of 6, with the F-19 variations being correlated with the already established
oxygen variations, and anti-correlated with the sodium and aluminium
variations. In this paper we thus add fluorine to the list of elements known to
vary in globular cluster stars, and this provides further evidence that
H-burning is the root cause of the chemical inhomegeneities. The fact that F-19
is found to decrease in the M4 stars, as the signature of H-burning appears,
indicates that the polluting stars must have masses greater than about 3.5
solar masses, as less massive stars than this should produce, not destroy,
fluorine.",2005-06-30T16:45:35Z
"Supermassive Black Holes in Elliptical Galaxies: Switching from Very
  Bright to Very Dim","Relativistic outflows (mainly observed in the radio) are a characteristic
feature of both Galactic stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes
(SMBHs). Simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of Galactic sources have
shown that the outflow is strong at low accretion rates, but it weakens
dramatically or disappears completely at high accretion rates, manifesting
structural changes in the accretion flow. It is reasonable to assume that SMBHs
follow the same trend. For low luminosity SMBHs in nearby elliptical galaxies
and clusters, recent observations strongly suggest that the outflows play the
central role in keeping the gas hot (mechanical feedback). If the outflow is
quenched in SMBHs at high accretion rates similarly to the behavior of galactic
sources, then the straightforward consequence is a relatively weak feedback of
rapidly accreting SMBHs. We argue that elliptical galaxies and their central
engines should then evolve through two stages. Early on, the central SMBH
rapidly grows by accreting cooling gas at a near-Eddington rate with high
radiative efficiency but with weak feedback on the infalling gas. This stage
terminates when the black hole has grown to a sufficiently large mass that its
feedback (radiative and/or mechanical), despite the low gas heating efficiency,
is able to suppress gas cooling. After that the system switches to a stable
state corresponding to passively evolving ellipticals, when the accretion rate
and radiative efficiency are very low, but the gas heating efficiency is high
and energy input from the relativistic outflow keeps the gas hot.",2005-07-04T15:55:08Z
Iron-Line Emission as a Probe of Bardeen-Petterson Accretion Disks,"In this work we show that Bardeen-Petterson accretion disks can exhibit
unique, detectable features in relativistically broadened emission line
profiles. Some of the unique characteristics include inverted line profiles
with sharper red horns and softer blue horns and even profiles with more than 2
horns from a single rest-frame line. We demonstrate these points by
constructing a series of synthetic line profiles using simple two-component
disk models. We find that the resultant profiles are very sensitive to the two
key parameters one would like to constrain, namely the Bardeen-Petterson
transition radius r_{BP} and the relative tilt \beta between the two disk
components over a range of likely values [10 < r_{BP}/(GM/c^2) < 40 ; 15deg <
\beta < 45deg]. We use our findings to show that some of the ``extra'' line
features observed in the spectrum of the Seyfert-I galaxy MCG--6-30-15 may be
attributable to a Bardeen-Petterson disk structure. Similarly, we apply our
findings to two likely Bardeen-Petterson candidate Galactic black holes - GRO
J1655-40 and XTE J1550-564. We provide synthetic line profiles of these systems
using observationally constrained sets of parameters. Although we do not
formally fit the data for any of these systems, we confirm that our synthetic
spectra are consistent with current observations.",2005-07-12T22:40:08Z
"The Origin of T Tauri X-ray Emission: New Insights from the Chandra
  Orion Ultradeep Project","We use the data of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) to study the
nearly 600 X-ray sources that can be reliably identified with optically well
characterized T Tauri stars (TTS) in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We detect X-ray
emission from more than 97% of the optically visible late-type (spectral types
F to M) cluster stars. This proofs that there is no ``X-ray quiet'' population
of late-type stars with suppressed magnetic activity. All TTS with known
rotation periods lie in the saturated or super-saturated regime of the relation
between activity and Rossby numbers seen for main-sequence (MS) stars, but the
TTS show a much larger scatter in X-ray activity than seen for the MS stars.
Strong near-linear relations between X-ray luminosities, bolometric
luminosities and mass are present. We also find that the fractional X-ray
luminosity rises slowly with mass over the 0.1 - 2 M_sun range. The plasma
temperatures determined from the X-ray spectra of the TTS are much hotter than
in MS stars, but seem to follow a general solar-stellar correlation between
plasma temperature and activity level. The large scatter about the relations
between X-ray activity and stellar parameters seems to be related to the
influence of accretion on the X-ray emission. While the X-ray activity of the
non-accreting TTS is consistent with that of rapidly rotating MS stars, the
accreting stars are less X-ray active (by a factor of ~2-3 on average) and
produce much less well defined correlations than the non-accretors. We discuss
possible reasons for the suppression of X-ray emission by accretion and the
implications of our findings on long-standing questions related to the origin
of the X-ray emission from young stars.",2005-06-22T07:28:39Z
"Light and heavy metal abundances in hot central stars of planetary
  nebulae","We present new results from our spectral analyses of very hot central stars
achieved since the last IAU Symposium on planetary nebulae held in Canberra
2001. The analyses are mainly based on UV and far-UV spectroscopy performed
with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer
but also on ground-based observations performed at the Very Large Telescope and
other observatories. We report on temperature, gravity, and abundance
determinations for the CNO elements of hydrogen-rich central stars. In many
hydrogen-deficient central stars (spectral type PG1159) we discovered
particular neon and fluorine lines, which are observed for the very first time
in any astrophysical object. Their analysis strongly confirms the idea that
these stars exhibit intershell matter as a consequence of a late helium-shell
flash.",2005-08-03T15:19:10Z
"2D stationary resistive MHD flows: borderline to magnetic reconnection
  solutions","We present the basic equations for stationary, incompressible resistive MHD
flows in two dimensions. This leads to a system of differential equations for
two flux functions, one elliptic partial differential equation
(Grad-Shafranov-like) for the magnetic flux function and one for the stream
function of the flow. In these equations two potentials appear: one potential
is a generalized pressure. The second potential couples the magnetic and the
flow shear components of the system. With the restriction to flux or at least
line conserving flows one has to solve a modified Ohm's law. For the two
dimensional case these are two coupled differential equations, which represent
the borderline between the resistive but flux conserving (or line conserving)
case, and that of reconnective solutions. We discuss some simplified solutions
of these equations.",2005-05-27T14:00:38Z
"Probing Cosmic Acceleration Beyond the Equation of State: Distinguishing
  between Dark Energy and Modified Gravity Models","If general relativity is the correct theory of physics on large scales, then
there is a differential equation that relates the Hubble expansion function,
inferred from measurements of angular diameter distance and luminosity
distance, to the growth rate of large scale structure. For a dark energy fluid
without couplings or an unusual sound speed, deviations from this consistency
relationship could be the signature of modified gravity on cosmological scales.
We propose a procedure based on this consistency relation in order to
distinguish between some dark energy models and modified gravity models. The
procedure uses different combinations of cosmological observations and is able
to find inconsistencies when present. As an example, we apply the procedure to
a universe described by a recently proposed 5-dimensional modified gravity
model. We show that this leads to an inconsistency within the dark energy
parameter space detectable by future experiments.",2005-07-07T20:33:45Z
CO in HI Self-Absorbed Clouds in Perseus,"We have observed 12CO J = 2-1 and J = 1-0, and 13CO J = 1-0 emission in two
regions of HI Self-Absorption (HISA) in Perseus: a small, isolated HISA feature
called the globule and a more extended HISA cloud called the complex. Using
both Large Velocity Gradient and Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes we found
that, in the globule, N(12CO) < 6.0x10^15 cm-2 which, using PDR models, implies
that N(H_2) < 9.9x10^20 cm-2. In the complex we found that the H_2 column
densities ranged from 1.2 - 2.2 x 10^21 cm-2. By comparing the HISA and CO
observations we are able to constrain the physical conditions and atomic gas
fraction (f). In the globule, 8 K < T_spin < 22 K and 0.02 < f < 0.2 depending
on whether the (unknown) gas density is 10^2, 10^3, or 10^4 cm-3. In the
complex, 12 K < T_spin < 24 K, 0.02 < f < 0.05, and we were also able to
constrain the gas density (100 < n < 1200 cm-3). These results imply that the
gas in the HISA clouds is colder and denser than that usually associated with
the atomic ISM and, indeed, is similar to that seen in molecular clouds. The
small atomic gas fractions also imply that there is a significant molecular
component in these HISA clouds, even when little or no 12CO is detected. The
level of 12CO detected and the visual extinction due to dust is consistent with
the idea that these HISA clouds are undergoing a transition from the atomic to
molecular phase.",2005-06-27T20:08:24Z
"Could the 47 UMa Planetary System be a Second Solar System: predicting
  the Earth-like planets","(Abridged)We numerically investigated the dynamical architecture of 47 UMa
with the planetary configuration of the best-fit orbital solutions by Fischer
et al. We systematically studied the existence of Earth-like planets in the
region 0.05 AU $\leq a \leq 2.0$ AU for 47 UMa with numerical simulations, and
we also explored the packed planetary geometry and Trojan planets in the
system. In the simulations, we found that ""hot Earths"" at 0.05 AU $\leq a < $
0.4 AU can dynamically survive at least for 1 Myr. The Earth-like planets can
eventually remain in the system for 10 Myr in areas involved in the mean motion
resonances (MMR) (e.g., 3:2 MMR) with the inner companion. Moreover, we showed
that the 2:1 and 3:1 resonances are on the fringe of stability, while the 5:2
MMR is unstable. Additionally, the 2:1 MMR marks out a remarkable boundary
between chaotic and regular motions, inside, most of the orbits can survive,
outside, they are mostly lost in the orbital evolution. In a dynamical sense,
the most likely candidate for habitable environment is Earth-like planets with
orbits in the ranges 0.8 AU $\leq a < 1.0$ AU and 1.0 AU $ < a < 1.30$ AU
(except several unstable cases) with relatively low eccentricities. The Trojan
planets with low eccentricities and inclinations can secularly last at the
triangular equilibrium points of two massive planets. Hence, the 47 UMa
planetary system may be a close analog to our solar system.",2005-06-16T08:42:39Z
"Age spreads in star forming regions: The lithium test in the Orion
  Nebula Cluster","We present the initial results of a study of the surface lithium abundance in
a sample of low-mass members (M~0.4-1.0 Msun) of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC)
that provide an independent clock to estimate stellar ages. We report discovery
of significant depletion of lithium in four stars with estimated mass of ~0.4
Msun and age ~10Myr. Comparison with the predictions of numerical and
analytical models shows excellent agreement between the isochronal age and
lithium depletion time scale for two objects, the first case in lithium-poor
pre-main sequence stars. Our results bear on the issue of the real age spread
in the ONC and hence on the overall duration of the star formation process,
indicating that the stellar population did not came into existence in a single,
rapid burst.",2005-05-09T08:39:34Z
A Supernova Factory in Mrk 273?,"We report on 1.6 and 5.0 GHz observations of the ultraluminous infrared
galaxy (ULIRG) Mrk 273, using the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the
Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN). We also make use of
published 1.4 GHz VLBA observations of Mrk 273 by Carilli & Taylor (2000). Our
5 GHz images have a maximum resolution of 5-10 mas, which corresponds to linear
resolutions of 3.5-7 pc at the distance of Mrk 273, and are the most sensitive
high-resolution radio observations yet made of this ULIRG. Component N1, often
pinpointed as a possible AGN, displays a steep spectral index ($\alpha = 1.2
\pm 0.1; S_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$); hence it is very difficult to reconcile
with N1 being an AGN, and rather suggests that the compact nonthermal radio
emission is produced by an extremely high luminous individual radio supernova
(RSN), or a combination of unresolved emission from nested supernova remnants
(SNR), luminous RSNe, or both. Component N2 is partly resolved out into several
compact radio sources --none of which clearly dominates-- and a region of
extended emission about 30 pc in size. The integrated spectral index of this
region is flat ($\alpha = 0.15 \pm 0.1$), which can be interpreted as due to a
superposition of several unresolved components, e.g., RSNe or SNRs, whose radio
emission peaks at different frequencies and is partially free-free absorbed.
The overall extended radio emission from component N is typical of nonthermal,
optically thin radio emission ($\alpha = 0.8 \pm 0.1$), and its 1.4 GHz
luminosity ($L_{1.4 \rm GHz} = (2.2 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{23} $ WHz$^{-1}$) is
consistent with being produced by relativistic electrons diffused away from
supernova remnants in an outburst.",2005-05-18T11:13:17Z
"Pulse-phase spectroscopy of SMC X-1 with Chandra and XMM-Newton:
  reprocessing by a precessing disk?","We present pulse-phase X-ray spectroscopy of the high-mass X-ray pulsar SMC
X-1 from five different epochs, using Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-S and
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data. The X-ray spectrum consistently shows two distinct
components, a hard power law and a soft blackbody with kT_BB ~ 0.18 keV. For
all five epochs the hard component shows a simple double-peaked pulse shape,
and also a variation in the power law slope, which becomes harder at maximum
flux and softer at minimum flux. For the soft component, the pulse profile
changes between epochs, in both shape and phase relative to the power law
pulses. The soft component is likely produced by reprocessing of the hard X-ray
pulsar beam by the inner accretion disk. We use a model of a twisted inner
disk, illuminated by the rotating X-ray pulsar beam, to simulate pulsations in
the soft component due to this reprocessing. We find that for some disk and
beam geometries, precession of an illuminated accretion disk can roughly
reproduce the observed long-term changes in the soft pulse profiles.",2005-06-18T18:48:00Z
Two Pulsar Wind Nebulae: Chandra/XMM-Newton Imaging of GeV J1417-6100,"We report on Chandra ACIS and XMM-Newton MOS/PN imaging observations of two
pulsar wind nebulae (K3/PSR J1420-6048 and G313.3+0.1=`the rabbit') associated
with the Galactic unidentified gamma-ray source GeV J1417-6100. With the
excellent ACIS imaging, the very energetic pulsar PSR J1420-6048 is separated
from its surrounding nebula. This nebula has surprisingly little compact
structure, although a faint arc is seen near the pulsar. Similarly, two point
sources are resolved in the rabbit nebula. The large XMM-Newton collecting area
provides useful spectral constraints on the rabbit and the associated point
sources. Based on spectra and X-ray morphology, we identify one point source as
a plausible pulsar counterpart. Large backgrounds and low source counts limited
pulse search sensitivities, but we report pulse upper limits and a candidate
108ms period for the rabbit pulsar based on the XMM-Newton data and an ACIS CC
observation. Comparison of the X-ray images with high resolution ATCA radio
maps shows that the non-thermal X-ray emission corresponds well with the radio
structure.",2005-03-31T02:31:31Z

End-effects in rapidly rotating cylindrical Taylor-Couette flow,"We present numerical simulations of the flow in a rapidly rotating
cylindrical annulus. We show that at the rotation rates relevant to the
magneto-rotational instability, the flow is strongly constrained by the
Taylor-Proudman theorem. As a result, it is controlled almost entirely by the
end-plates. We then consider two possible options for minimizing these
end-effects, namely (i) simply taking a very long cylinder, and (ii) splitting
the end-plates into a series of differentially rotating rings. Regarding option
(i), we show that the cylinder would have to be hundreds of times as long as it
is wide before end-effects become unimportant in the interior. Since this is
clearly not feasible, we turn to option (ii), and show that in order to obtain
a smooth angular velocity profile, the end-plates would have to be split into
around ten rings. If the end-plates are split into fewer rings, perhaps 3-5,
the angular velocity profile will not be smooth, but will instead consist of a
series of Stewartson layers at the boundaries from one ring to the next. We
suggest therefore that the instabilities one obtains in this system will be the
familiar Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of these Stewartson layers, rather than
the magneto-rotational instability. At best, one might hope to obtain the MRI
superimposed on these Kelvin-Helmholtz modes. Any subsequent interpretation of
results is thus likely to be quite complicated.",2005-06-03T16:04:42Z
"Spatially resolved stellar populations in the isolated elliptical NGC
  821","We present the analysis of Lick absorption-line indices from three separate
long-slit spectroscopic observations of the nearby isolated elliptical galaxy
NGC 821. The three data sets present a consistent picture of the stellar
population within one effective radius, in which strong gradients are evident
in both luminosity-weighted age and metallicity. The central population
exhibits a young age of ~4 Gyr and a metallicity ~3 times solar. At one
effective radius the age has risen to ~12 Gyr and the metallicity fallen to
less than 1/3 solar. The low metallicity population around one effective radius
appears to have an exclusively red horizontal branch, with no significant
contribution from the blue horizontal branch evident in some globular clusters
of the same age and metallicity. Despite the strong central age gradient, we
demonstrate that only a small fraction (<10%) of the galaxy's stellar mass can
have been created in recent star formation events. We consider possible star
formation histories for NGC 821 and find that the most likely cause of the
young central population was a minor merger or tidal interaction that caused
NGC 821 to consume its own gas in a centrally concentrated burst of star
formation 1 to 4 Gyr ago.",2005-06-22T05:15:30Z
Can a photometric redshift code reliably determine dust extinction?,"Photometric redshifts can be routinely obtained to accuracies of better than
0.1 in Delta(z)/(1+z). However, the issue of dust extinction is one that has
still not been well quantified. In this paper the success of two
template-fitting photometric redshift codes (IMPZ and HYPERZ) at reliably
returning Av in addition to redshift is explored. New data on the CNOC2
spectroscopic sample of 0.2<z<0.7 galaxies are presented. These data allow us
to estimate Av values from the observed Balmer decrements. We also investigate
whether the empirical value of gamma=0.44, the ratio between gas- and star-
derived extinction, as determined by Calzetti (2001), is necessarily the best
value for this sample.
  When comparing the two codes to the Balmer-derived Av, a correlation between
the photometrically derived Av, Phot-Av, and the Balmer-Av is found. The
correlation is improved when the empirical value of gamma=0.44 is allowed to
vary. From least-squares-fitting the minimum in the reduced chi^2 distribution
is found for gamma~0.25 +/- 0.2. For the sample of galaxies here, the factor of
two difference in covering factor implied by the Calzetti ratio is found to be
plausible. The CNOC2 galaxies with detected Balmer lines have some preference
for an increased covering factor difference, which would perhaps imply they are
undergoing more rapid, `bursty' star formation than the galaxies Calzetti used
in her derivation.",2005-05-05T20:00:16Z
"Stellar Content from high resolution galactic spectra via Maximum A
  Posteriori","This paper describes STECMAP (STEllar Content via Maximum A Posteriori), a
flexible, non-parametric inversion method for the interpretation of the
integrated light spectra of galaxies, based on synthetic spectra of single
stellar populations (SSPs). We focus on the recovery of a galaxy's star
formation history and stellar age-metallicity relation. We use the high
resolution SSPs produced by PEGASE-HR to quantify the informational content of
the wavelength range 4000 - 6800 Angstroms.
  A detailed investigation of the properties of the corresponding simplified
linear problem is performed using singular value decomposition. It turns out to
be a powerful tool for explaining and predicting the behaviour of the
inversion. We provide means of quantifying the fundamental limitations of the
problem considering the intrinsic properties of the SSPs in the spectral range
of interest, as well as the noise in these models and in the data.
  We performed a systematic simulation campaign and found that, when the time
elapsed between two bursts of star formation is larger than 0.8 dex, the
properties of each episode can be constrained with a precision of 0.04 dex in
age and 0.02 dex in metallicity from high quality data (R=10 000,
signal-to-noise ratio SNR=100 per pixel), not taking model errors into account.
  The described methods and error estimates will be useful in the design and in
the analysis of extragalactic spectroscopic surveys.",2005-05-10T20:07:07Z
TeV neutrinos from microquasars in compact massive binaries,"We consider a compact binary system in which a Wolf-Rayet star supplies
matter onto a stellar mass black hole or a neutron star. This matter forms an
accretion disk which ejects a jet as observed in Galactic microquasars. A part
of the jet kinetic energy, typically 10%, can be transfered to relativistic
nuclei. These nuclei lose nucleons as a result of photo-disintegration process
in collisions with thermal photons from the accretion disk and the massive
star. Due to the head on photon-nucleus collisions most of neutrons released
from nuclei move towards the surface of the accretion disk and/or the massive
star producing neutrinos in collisions with the matter. We calculate the
spectra of muon neutrinos and expected neutrino event rates in a 1 km^2
neutrino detector of the IceCube type from a microquasar inside our Galaxy
applying, as an example, the parameters of the Cyg X-3 binary system, provided
that nuclei are accelerated to the Lorentz factors above 10^6 with the power
law spectrum with an index close to 2.",2005-05-27T07:37:52Z
Covariant Kinetic Theory with an Application to the Coma Cluster,"In this paper, we introduce a novel solution to the covariant Landau equation
for a pure electron plasma. The method conserves energy and particle number,
and reduces smoothly to the Rosenbluth potentials of non-relativistic theory.
In addition, we find that a fully relativistic plasma equilibrates in only
1/100th of a Spitzer time--much faster than in the non-relativistic limit--a
factor of significant import to situations in which distortions to a Maxwellian
distribution are produced by anomalous methods of acceleration. To demonstrate
the power of our solution in dealing with hot, astrophysical plasmas, we use
this technique to show that one of the currently considered models--continuous
stochastic acceleration--for the hard X-ray emission in the Coma cluster
actually cannot work because the energy gained by the particles is distributed
to the {\it whole} plasma on a time scale much shorter than that of the
acceleration process itself.",2005-05-02T20:27:59Z
Two extreme double-peaked line emitters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"Double-peaked Balmer lines have been observed in about 150 AGNs and were
interpreted preferably as emission from relativistic accretion disks. In this
paper, we report the discovery of extreme double-peaked lines in SDSS
J0942+0900 and SDSS J1417+6141. The FWHM of the Halpha line ~40,600 km/s in the
first object is almost twice as large as the broadest one previously known. By
comparing the line profile with accretion disk models, we find that most of the
line flux is emitted from a narrow annulus around 100Rg in SDSS J0942+0900, and
from a disk of radii between 100 and 400Rg in SDSS J1417+6141. This is the
first time that an accretion disk at radii below 100Rg can be directly probed
through optical emission lines. A certain asymmetry in the disk is required for
both objects. Another much weaker broad Halpha component (EW~20A, and FWHM
4000km/s) is also detected in both objects. Both objects show weak radio
emission and strong high-ionization narrow lines.",2005-04-14T11:01:34Z
The Fall 2004 SDSS Supernova Survey,"In preparation for the Supernova Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) II, a proposed 3-year extension to the SDSS, we have conducted an early
engineering and science run during the fall of 2004, which consisted of
approximately 20 scheduled nights of repeated imaging of half of the southern
equatorial stripe. Transient supernova-like events were detected in near
real-time and photometric measurements were made in the five SDSS filter
bandpasses with a cadence of ~2 days. Candidate type Ia supernovae (SNe) were
pre-selected based on their colors, light curve shape, and the properties of
the host galaxy. Follow-up spectroscopic observations were performed with the
Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5m telescope and the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly
Telescope to confirm their types and measure the redshifts. The 2004 campaign
resulted in 22 spectroscopically confirmed SNe, which includes 16 type Ia, 5
type II, and 1 type Ib/c. These SN Ia will help fill in the sparsely sampled
redshift interval of z = 0.05 - 0.35, the so-called 'redshift desert', in the
Hubble diagram. Detailed investigation of the spectral properties of these
moderate-redshift SNe Ia will also provide a bridge between local SNe and
high-redshift objects, and will help us understand the systematics for future
cosmological applications that require high photometric precision. Finally, the
large survey volume also provides the opportunity to select unusual supernovae
for spectroscopic study that are poorly sampled in other surveys. We report on
some of the early results from this program and discuss potential future
applications.",2005-04-20T20:34:03Z
Confinement of supernova explosions in a collapsing cloud,"We analyze the confining effect of cloud collapse on an expanding supernova
shockfront. We solve the differential equation for the forces on the shockfront
due to ram pressure, supernova energy, and gravity. We find that the expansion
of the shockfront is slowed and in fact reversed by the collapsing cloud.
Including radiative losses and a potential time lag between supernova explosion
and cloud collapse shows that the expansion is reversed at smaller distances as
compared to the non-radiative case. We also consider the case of multiple
supernova explosions at the center of a collapsing cloud. For instance, if we
scale our self-similar solution to a single supernova of energy 10^51 ergs
occurring when a cloud of initial density 10^2 H/cm^3 has collapsed by 50%, we
find that the shockfront is confined to ~15 pc in ~1 Myrs. Our calculations are
pertinent to the observed unusually compact non-thermal radio emission in blue
compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs). More generally, we demonstrate the potential of
a collapsing cloud to confine supernovae, thereby explaining how dwarf galaxies
would exist beyond their first generation of star formation.",2005-05-13T19:59:55Z
Size dependence of solar X-ray flare properties,"Non-thermal and thermal parameters of 85 solar flares of GOES class B1 to M6
(background subtracted classes A1 to M6) have been compared to each other. The
hard X-ray flux has been measured by RHESSI and a spectral fitting provided
flux and spectral index of the non-thermal emission, as well as temperature and
emission measure of the thermal emission. The soft X-ray flux was taken from
GOES measurements. We find a linear correlation in a double logarithmic plot
between the non-thermal flux and the spectral index. The higher the
acceleration rate of a flare, the harder the non-thermal electron distribution.
The relation is similar to the one found by a comparison of the same parameters
from several sub-peaks of a single flare. Thus small flares behave like small
subpeaks of large flares. Thermal flare properties such as temperature,
emission measure and the soft X-ray flux also correlate with peak non-thermal
flux. A large non-thermal peak flux entails an enhancement in both thermal
parameters. The relation between spectral index and the non-thermal flux is an
intrinsic feature of the particle acceleration process, depending on flare
size. This property affects the reported frequency distribution of flare
energies.",2005-05-09T12:21:24Z
"A HST study of the stellar populations in the cometary dwarf irregular
  galaxy NGC 2366","We present V and I photometry of the resolved stars in the cometary dwarf
irregular galaxy NGC 2366, using Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images obtained
with the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting color-magnitude diagram reaches
down to I~26.0 mag. It reveals not only a young population of blue
main-sequence stars (age <30 Myr) but also an intermediate-age population of
blue and red supergiants (20 Myr<age<100 Myr), and an older evolved populations
of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (age >100 Myr) and red giant branch
(RGB) stars (age >1 Gyr). The measured magnitude I=23.65+/-0.10 mag of the RGB
tip results in a distance modulus m-M=27.67+/-0.10, which corresponds to a
distance of 3.42+/-0.15 Mpc, in agreement with previous distance
determinations. The youngest stars are associated with the bright complex of
HII regions NGC 2363=Mrk 71 in the southwest extremity of the galaxy. As a
consequence of the diffusion and relaxation processes of stellar ensembles, the
older the stellar population is, the smoother and more extended is its spatial
distribution. An underlying population of older stars is found throughout the
body of NGC 2366. The most notable feature of this older population is the
presence of numerous relatively bright AGB stars. The number ratio of AGB to
RGB stars and the average absolute brightness of AGB stars in NGC 2366 are
appreciably higher than in the BCD VII Zw 403, indicating a younger age of the
AGB stars in NGC 2366. In addition to the present burst of age <100 Myr, there
has been strong star formation activity in the past of NGC 2366, from ~100 Myr
to <3 Gyr ago.",2005-03-19T22:25:08Z
"Hydrodynamic Simulations of A Moving Substructure in A Cluster of
  Galaxies: Cold Fronts and Turbulence Generation","We perform three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a moving
substructure in a cluster of galaxies. We investigate dynamical evolution of
the intracluster medium (ICM) in and around the substructure moving radially in
the larger cluster's gravitational potential, and its observational
consequences. After the substructure passes the larger cluster's center, a bow
shock and clear contact discontinuity form in front of it. The contact
discontinuity looks like a sharp cold front in the X-ray image synthesized from
the simulation results. This agrees with a structure found in 1E 0657-56. The
flow structure remains laminar before the first turnaround because the
ram-pressure stripping is dominant over the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities on the boundary between the substructure and the ambient ICM.
  When a subcluster oscillates radially around the larger cluster's center,
both Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop well and the
flow structure becomes highly turbulent. Around the turnaround, the
subcluster's cold gas is pushed out of its potential well.
  Therefore, the cold gas component appears to be in front of the subcluster. A
relatively blunt cold front appears in the simulated
  X-ray image because the contact discontinuity is perturbed by Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities. This can explain the ICM structure found in A168.",2005-05-13T05:14:59Z
The zero-crossing scale and the problem of galaxy bias,"One of the main problems in the studies of large scale galaxy structures
concerns the relation of the correlation properties of a certain population of
objects with those of a selected subsample of it, when the selection is
performed by considering physical quantities like luminosity or mass. I
consider the case where the sampling is defined as in the simplest thresholding
selection scheme of the peaks of a Gaussian random field as well as the case of
the extraction of point distributions in high density regions from
gravitational N-body simulations. I show that an invariant scale under sampling
is represented by the zero-crossing scale of \xi(r). By considering recent
measurements in the 2dF and SDSS galaxy surveys I note that the zero-point
crossing length has not yet been clearly identified, while a dependence on the
finite sample size related to the integral constraint is manifest. I show that
this implies that other length scales derived from \xi(r) are also affected by
finite size effects. I discuss the theoretical implications of these results,
when considering the comparison of structures formed in N-body simulations and
observed in galaxy samples, and different tests to study this problem.",2005-07-12T09:58:02Z
"Chemical Composition in the Globular Cluster M71 from Keck/HIRES Spectra
  of Turn-Off Stars","We have made observations with the Keck I telescope and HIRES at a resolution
of $\sim$45,000 of five nearly identical stars at the turn-off of the
metal-rich globular cluster M 71. Our mean Fe abundance, [Fe/H]=-0.80 +-0.02,
is in excellent agreement with previous cluster determinations from both giants
and near-turnoff stars. There is no clear evidence for any star-to-star
abundance differences or correlations in our sample. Abundance ratios of the
Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni) are similar to Fe. The turn-off stars in M71 have
remarkably consistent enhancements of 0.2 - 0.3 dex in [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe] and
[Ti/Fe] -- like the red giants. Our [Mg/Fe] ratio is somewhat lower than that
suggested by other studies. We compare our mean abundances for the five M 71
stars with field stars of similar [Fe/H] -- 8 with halo kinematics and 17 with
disk kinematics. The abundances of the alpha-fusion products (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti)
agree with both samples, but seem a closer match to the disk stars. The Mg
abundance in M71 is at the lower edge of the disk and halo samples. The
neutron-capture elements, Y and Ba, are enhanced relative to solar in the M71
turn-off stars. Our ratio [Ba/Fe] is similar to that of the halo field stars
but a factor of two above that for the disk field stars. The important [Ba/Y]
ratio is significantly lower than M71 giant values. The Na content of the M71
turn-off stars is remarkably similar to that in the disk field stars, but more
than a factor of two higher than the halo field star sample. We find [Na/Fe] =
+0.14 $\pm$0.04 with a spread less than half of that found in the red giants in
M71. Excluding Mg, the lack of intracluster $\alpha$-element variations
(turn-off vs giants) suggests the polluting material arose in a more
traditional $s$-process environment such as AGB stars.",2005-05-06T22:09:51Z
Pairwise velocities in the Halo Model: Luminosity and Scale Dependence,"We investigate the properties of the pairwise velocity dispersion as a
function of galaxy luminosity in the context of a halo model. We derive the
distribution of velocities of pairs at a given separation taking into account
both one-halo and two-halo contributions. We show that pairwise velocity
distribution in real space is a complicated mixture of host-satellite,
satellite-satellite and two-halo pairs. The peak value is reached at around
1$h^{-1}$Mpc and does not reflect the velocity dispersion of a typical halo
hosting these galaxies, but is instead dominated by the satellite-satellite
pairs in high mass clusters. This is true even for cross-correlations between
bins separated in luminosity. As a consequence the velocity dispersion at a
given separation can decrease with luminosity, even if the underlying typical
halo host mass is increasing, in agreement with recent observations. We compare
our findings to numerical simulations and find a good agreement. Numerical
simulations also suggest a luminosity dependent velocity bias, which depends on
the subhalo mass. We develop models of the auto- and cross-correlation function
of luminosity subsamples of galaxies in the observable $r_\proj - \pi$ space
and calculate the inferred velocity dispersion as a function of wave vector if
dispersion model is fit to the redshift space power spectrum. We find that so
derived pairwise velocity dispersion also exhibits a bump at $k\sim 1 h/{\rm
Mpc}$.",2005-07-08T12:14:57Z
Spectroscopy with Multichannel Correlation Radiometers,"Correlation radiometers make true differential measurements in power with
high accuracy and small systematic errors. This receiver architecture has been
used in radio astronomy for measurements of continuum radiation for over 50
years; this article examines spectroscopy over broad bandwidths using
correlation techniques. After general discussions of correlation and the choice
of hybrid phase, experimental results from tests with a simple laboratory
multi-channel correlation radiometer are shown. Analysis of the effect of the
input hybrid's phase shows that a 90 degree hybrid is likely to be the best
general choice for radio astronomy, depending on its amplitude match and phase
flatness with frequency. The laboratory results verify that the combination of
the correlation architecture and an analog lag correlator is an excellent
method for spectroscopy over very wide bandwidths.",2005-04-20T18:59:35Z
Lyman alpha emission from local starburst galaxies and high-z objects,"We review the history and the current status of the understanding of the
processes that regulate Lyman alpha emission from star-forming galaxies. We
present some of the most recent results of our study to image local starburst
galaxies in the Lyman alpha emission line using the Advanced Camera for Surveys
on the Hubble Space Telescope. Particular attention is dedicated to our study
of the low-metallicity, dust-poor Blue Compact Galaxy ESO338-IG04. We discuss
some of our local observational results with reference to the interpretation of
results of high-redshift Lyman alpha surveys and recent simulations of the
detection properties of high-z Lyman alpha emitting objects performed by our
group.",2005-07-15T13:05:18Z
"Measuring the primordial power spectrum: Principal component analysis of
  the cosmic microwave background","We implement and investigate a method for measuring departures from
scale-invariance, both scale-dependent as well as scale-free, in the primordial
power spectrum of density perturbations using cosmic microwave background (CMB)
C_l data and a principal component analysis technique. The primordial power
spectrum is decomposed into a dominant scale-invariant Gaussian adiabatic
component plus a series of orthonormal modes whose detailed form only depends
the noise model for a particular CMB experiment. However, in general these
modes are localised across wavenumbers with 0.01 < k < 0.2 Mpc^-1, displaying
rapid oscillations on scales corresponding the acoustic peaks where the
sensitivity to primordial power spectrum is greatest. The performance of this
method is assessed using simulated data for the Planck satellite, and the full
cosmological plus power spectrum parameter space is integrated out using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo. As a proof of concept we apply this data compression
technique to the current CMB data from WMAP, ACBAR, CBI and VSA. We find no
evidence for the breaking of scale-invariance from measurements of four PCA
mode amplitudes, which is translated to a constraint on the scalar spectral
index n_S(k_0=0.04 Mpc^-1)=0.94+-0.04 in accordance with WMAP studies.",2005-06-16T17:48:08Z
"The Cross-Correlation between Galaxies and Groups: Probing the Galaxy
  Distribution in and around Dark Matter Haloes","We determine the cross-correlation function between galaxies and galaxy
groups, using both the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We study the cross-correlation as a function
of group mass, and as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass, colour,
spectral type and specific star formation rate of the galaxies. All these
cross-correlation functions show a clear transition from the `1-halo' to the
`2-halo' regimes on a scale comparable to the virial radius of the groups in
consideration. On scales larger than the virial radius, all cross-correlation
functions are roughly parallel, consistent with the linear bias model. In
particular, the large scale correlation amplitudes are higher for more massive
groups, and for brighter and redder galaxies. In the `1-halo' regime, the
cross-correlation function depends strongly on the definition of the group
center. We consider both a luminosity-weighted center (LWC) and a center
defined by the location of the brightest group galaxy (BGC). With the first
definition, the bright early-type galaxies in massive groups are found to be
more centrally concentrated than the fainter, late-type galaxies. Using the
BGC, and excluding the brightest galaxy from the cross correlation analysis, we
only find significant segregation in massive groups ($M \gta
10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$) for galaxies of different spectral types (or colours or
specific star formation rates). In haloes with masses $\la 10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$,
there is a significant deficit of bright satellite galaxies. Comparing the
results from the 2dFGRS with those obtained from realistic mock samples, we
find that the distribution of galaxies in groups is much less concentrated than
dark matter haloes predicted by the current $\Lambda$CDM model. (Abridged)",2005-04-21T17:03:26Z
"On the nature of two low M-dot X-ray bursters: 1RXS J170854.4-321857 and
  1RXS J171824.2-402934","We carried out Chandra observations of two low-luminosity low-mass X-ray
binaries, 1RXS J170854.4-321857 and 1RXS J171824.2-402934, for which previously
single X-ray bursts had been detected with the Wide Field Cameras (WFCs) on
board BeppoSAX. Both were detected in our Chandra observations in an actively
accreting state three to eight years after the X-ray bursts, with 0.5-10 keV
luminosities between 5x10^34 and 2x10^36 erg/s. The apparently persistent
nature is remarkable for 1RXS J171824.2-402934 given its low luminosity of
0.001L_Edd. The persistence of both sources also distinguishes them from 5
other low-L bursters, which have also been seen during bursts with the WFCs but
were not detected during Chandra observations above a luminosity of 10^33
erg/s. Those are probably transient rather than persistent sources.",2005-05-25T16:33:53Z
Formation of Structure in Molecular Clouds: A Case Study,"Molecular clouds (MCs) are highly structured and ``turbulent''. Colliding gas
streams of atomic hydrogen have been suggested as a possible source of MCs,
imprinting the filamentary structure as a consequence of dynamical and thermal
instabilities. We present a 2D numerical analysis of MC formation via
converging HI flows. Even with modest flow speeds and completely uniform
inflows, non-linear density perturbations as possible precursors of MCs arise.
Thus, we suggest that MCs are inevitably formed with substantial structure,
e.g., strong density and velocity fluctuations, which provide the initial
conditions for subsequent gravitational collapse and star formation in a
variety of galactic and extragalactic environments.",2005-07-24T18:26:08Z
"Correlation between radio luminosity and X-ray timing frequencies in
  neutron star and black hole X-ray binaries","We report on correlations between radio luminosity and X-ray timing features
in X-ray binary systems containing low magnetic field neutron stars and black
holes. The sample of neutron star systems consists of 4U 1728-34, 4U 1820-34,
Ser X-1, MXB 1730-335, GX 13+1, the millisecond X-ray pulsars SAX J1808.4-3658
and IGR J00291+5934, and these are compared with the black hole system GX
339-4. The analysis has been done using data from pointed observations of the
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer coordinated with radio observations. In the neutron
star systems the radio luminosity L_{R} is correlated with the characteristic
frequency of the L_{h} Lorentzian component detected contemporaneously in the
power spectrum, and anticorrelated with its strength. Similarly, in the black
hole system GX 339-4 L_{R} is correlated with the frequency of the L_{\ell}
component in the power spectrum, and anti-correlated with its strength. The
index of a power-law fit to the correlation is similar in both cases, L_{R}
\propto \nu^{~1.4} and L_{R} \propto (rms)^{-2.3}. At lower timing frequencies,
the radio luminosity is further found to be correlated with the characteristic
(break) frequency of the L_{b} component of the power spectra in the neutron
stars and, marginally, with the equivalent break frequency in GX 339-4. We
briefly discuss the coupling between the innermost regions of the accretion
disc and the production of the jet and, from the behaviour of the ms accreting
X-ray pulsars, the possible role of the NS magnetic field.",2005-07-11T16:53:50Z
XMM-Newton observations of AM CVn binaries,"We present the results of XMM-Newton observations of four AM CVn systems --
AM CVn, CR Boo, HP Lib and GP Com. Their light curves show very different
characteristics. The X-ray light curves show no coherent pulsations, suggesting
the accreting white dwarfs have relatively low magnetic field strengths. Their
spectra were best modelled using a multi-temperature emission model and a
strong UV component. We find that CR Boo and HP Lib have X-ray spectra with
abundances consistent with relatively low temperature CNO processed material,
while AM CVn and GP Com show an enhancement of nitrogen. A large fraction of
the accretion luminosity is emitted in the UV. We determine accretion
luminosities of ~1.6x10^{33} ergs/s and 1.7x10^{31} ergs/s for AM CVn and GP
Com respectively. Comparing the implied mass transfer rates with that derived
using model fits to optical and UV spectra, we find evidence that in the case
of AM CVn, we do not detect a significant proportion of the accretion energy.
This missing component could be lost in the form of a wind.",2005-05-27T09:27:54Z
Blank Field Sources in the ROSAT HRI Brera Multiscale Wavelet catalog,"The search for Blank Field Sources (BFS), i.e. X-ray sources without optical
counterparts, paves the way to the identification of unusual objects in the
X-ray sky. Here we present four BFS detected in the Brera Multiscale Wavelet
catalog of ROSAT HRI observations. This sample has been selected on the basis
of source brightness, distance from possible counterparts at other wavelengths,
point-like shape and good estimate of the X-ray flux (f_X). The observed f_X
and the limiting magnitude of the optical catalogs fix a lower limit for our
BFS on f_X/f_opt~40. This value puts them well beyond 90% threshold for usual
source classes once HRI energy band and proper spectral shape are taken into
account, leaving room for speculation on their nature. Three BFS show also
evidence of a transient behaviour.",2005-05-13T16:06:19Z
"The Infrared Array Camera component of the Spitzer Space Telescope
  Extragalactic First Look Survey","We present Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) data and source catalogs from the
Spitzer Space Telescope Extragalactic First Look Survey. The data were taken in
four broad bands centered at nominal wavelengths of 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0
microns. A set of mosaics and catalogs have been produced which are ~80%
complete and ~99% reliable to their chosen flux density limits. The main field
survey covers 3.8 deg^2, and has flux density limits of 20muJy, 25muJy, 100muJy
and 100muJy at wavelengths of 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 microns,respectively. The
deeper ``verification'' survey covers 0.25 deg^2 with limits of 10muJy, 10muJy,
30muJy and 30muJy, respectively. We also include deep data in the ELAIS-N1
field which covers 0.041deg^2 with limits of 4muJy, 3muJy, 10muJy and 10muJy,
respectively, but with only two wavelength coverage at a given sky position.
The final bandmerged catalogs contain 103193 objects in the main field, 12224
in the verification field and 5239 in ELAIS-N1. Flux densities of high
signal-to-noise objects are accurate to about 10%, and the residual systematic
error in the absolute flux density scale is ~2-3%. We have successfully
extracted sources at source densities as high as 100000 deg^-2 in our deepest
3.6 and 4.5 micron data. The mosaics and source catalogs will be made available
through the Spitzer Science Center archive and the Infrared Science Archive.",2005-07-06T18:07:20Z
Evolution of Field Dwarf Galaxies with GEMS,"We present a study of the evolution of late-type field dwarfs over the last ~
1.9 Gyr, based on HST ACS observations carried out as part of the GEMS survey.
This study is amongst the first to probe the evolution of dwarfs over such a
large timescale. The comparison of structural properties, particularly size and
scale length, indicates that the dwarfs in the redshift range z ~ 0.01 to 0.15
(look-back times up to 1.9 Gyr) are more extended than local dwarfs. We argue
that this difference is due to the star formation activity becoming more
centrally concentrated in late-type dwarfs over the last ~ 1.9 Gyr. We discuss
several possible causes for this evolution. We also find a lack of blue compact
dwarfs in the GEMS sample and interpret this as indicative of the fact that
strong, centrally concentrated star formation is a feature of evolved dwarfs
that are entering their final stages of evolution.",2005-05-25T16:23:24Z
"Red-sequence galaxies with young stars and dust: The cluster Abell
  901/902 seen with COMBO-17","We report the discovery of a rich component of dusty star-forming galaxies
contaminating the red-sequence in the supercluster system comprising Abell
901a, 901b and A902 at redshift ~0.17. These galaxies do not fit into the
colour-density relation, because their preferred habitat is different from that
of regular red-sequence galaxies, which are typically dust-poor, old and
passively evolving. The dusty red galaxies prefer the medium-density outskirts
of clusters while being rare in both the low-density field and the high-density
cluster cores. This new result is based on the information content in the
medium-band photometry of the COMBO-17 survey. The photo-z accuracy of the ~800
brightest cluster galaxies is <0.01 and of the order of the velocity dispersion
of the cluster. This enables us to select a rich and clean cluster sample, in
which we can trace age-sensitive and dust-sensitive spectral features
independently with the detailed medium-band SED data. We find the red colour of
the dusty galaxies to be a result of dust extinction combined with relatively
old stellar ages. We speculate that the dusty red galaxies could either be a
product of minor mergers between established old red cluster galaxies with

"X-ray Emission from Wind Blown Bubbles. III. ASCA SIS Observations of
  NGC6888","We present ASCA SIS observations of the wind-blown bubble NGC6888. Owing to
the higher sensitivity of the SIS for higher energy photons compared to the
ROSAT PSPC, we are able to detect a T ~ 8x10^6 K plasma component in addition
to the T ~ 1.3x10^6 K component previously detected in PSPC observations. No
significant temperature variations are detected within NGC6888. Garcia-Segura &
Mac Low's (1995) analytical models of WR bubbles constrained by the observed
size, expansion velocity, and mass of the nebular shell under-predict the
stellar wind luminosity, and cannot reproduce simultaneously the observed X-ray
luminosity, spectrum, surface brightness profile, and SIS count rate of
NGC6888's bubble interior. The agreement between observations and expectations
from models can be improved if one or more of the following ad hoc assumptions
are made: (1) the stellar wind luminosity was weaker in the past, (2) the
bubble is at a special evolutionary stage and the nebular shell has recently
been decelerated to 1/2 of its previous expansion velocity, and (3) the heat
conduction between the hot interior and the cool nebular shell is suppressed.
Chandra and XMM-Newton observations with high spatial resolution and high
sensitivity are needed to determine accurately the physical conditions
NGC6888's interior hot gas for critical comparisons with bubble models.",2005-07-17T18:08:47Z
"Chandra HETGS Multi-Phase Spectroscopy of the Young Magnetic O Star
  theta^1 Orionis C","We report on four Chandra grating observations of the oblique magnetic
rotator theta^1 Ori C (O5.5 V) covering a wide range of viewing angles with
respect to the star's 1060 G dipole magnetic field. We employ line-width and
centroid analyses to study the dynamics of the X-ray emitting plasma in the
circumstellar environment, as well as line-ratio diagnostics to constrain the
spatial location, and global spectral modeling to constrain the temperature
distribution and abundances of the very hot plasma. We investigate these
diagnostics as a function of viewing angle and analyze them in conjunction with
new MHD simulations of the magnetically channeled wind shock mechanism on
theta^1 Ori C. This model fits all the data surprisingly well, predicting the
temperature, luminosity, and occultation of the X-ray emitting plasma with
rotation phase.",2005-04-13T14:03:15Z
A survey of NB921 dropouts in the Subaru Deep Field,"In order to search for high-redshift galaxies beyond $z = 6.6$ in the Subaru
Deep Field, we have investigated NB921-dropout galaxies where NB921 is the
narrowband filter centered at 919.6 nm with FWHM of 13.2 nm for the Suprime-Cam
on the Subaru Telescope. There are no secure NB921-dropout candidates brighter
than $z^\prime = 25.5$. Based on this result, we discuss the UV luminosity
function of star-forming galaxies at $z > 6.6$.",2005-07-12T05:25:27Z
"Quality studies of the data taking conditions for the Auger Fluorescence
  Detector","As more than half of the Fluorescence Detector (FD) of the Auger Observatory
is completed, data taking is becoming a routine job. It is then necessary to
follow strict procedures to assure the quality of the data. An overview of the
data taking methods is given. The nature of the FD background signal is due to
the night sky brightness (stars and planet faint light, moonlight, twilight,
airglow, zodiacal and artificial light) and to the electronic background
(photomultiplier and electronic noise). The analysis of the fluctuations in the
FADC signal (variance analysis), directly proportional to the background mean
light level, performed for each night of data taking is used to monitor the FD
background signal. The data quality is analysed using different techniques,
described in detail. Examples of trigger rates, number of stereo events, dead
time due to moonlight, weather or hardware problems are given. The analysis
comprises several months of data taking, giving an overview of the FD
capabilities, performance and allowing a systematic study of data and their
correlation with the environment.",2005-07-06T13:02:14Z
Some statistics of Galactic SNRs,"The selection effects applicable to the identification of Galactic supernova
remnants (SNRs) at radio wavelengths are discussed. Low surface brightness
remnants are missing, as are those with small angular sizes (including young
but distant SNRs). Several statistical properties of Galactic SNRs are
discussed, including the surface-brightness/diameter (Sigma-D) relation. The
wide range of intrinsic properties of Galactic remnants with known distances,
and the observational selection effects, means that the Sigma-D relation is of
limited use to derive diameters and hence distances for individual SNRs, or for
statistical studies.",2005-05-20T08:24:03Z
Blueshifted [O III] Emission: Indications of a Dynamic NLR,"The [O III] 5007 line is commonly used as an indicator of the systemic
redshift of AGNs. Also, recent studies have used the width of this emission
line as a proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy. This
paper calls both of these assumptions into question by analyzing a sample of
approximately 400 AGN spectra from the first data release of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. These spectra show that the low-ionization forbidden lines ([O II],
[N II], [S II]) define a consistent redshift, but that the peak of the [O III]
line is blueshifted in approximately half of the AGNs with respect to that
redshift. For the sample studied here, the average shift is 40 km/s, with the
largest shift being over 400 km/s. The magnitude of this shift is found to be
correlated with a number of properties, including the width of the [O III] line
and the Eddington ratio (L/L$_{Edd}$), derived from the luminosity and width of
H-beta.",2005-05-06T15:30:09Z
Effects of Inhomogeneities on Cosmic Expansion,"We evaluate the effect of inhomogeneity energy on the expansion rate of the
universe. Our method is to expand to Newtonian order in potential and velocity
but to take into account fully nonlinear density inhomogeneities. To linear
order in density, kinetic and gravitational potential energy contribute to the
total energy of the universe with the same scaling with expansion factor as
spatial curvature. In the strongly nonlinear regime, growth saturates, and the
net effect of the inhomogeneity energy on the expansion rate remains negligible
at all times. In particular, inhomogeneity contributions never mimic the
effects of dark energy or induce an accelerated expansion.",2005-04-19T19:38:29Z
The formation of DA white dwarfs with thin hydrogen envelopes,"We study the formation and evolution of DA white dwarfs, the progenitors of
which have experienced a late thermal pulse (LTP) shortly after the departure
from the thermally pulsing AGB. To this end, we compute the complete evolution
of an initially 2.7 Mo star all the way from the zero-age main sequence to the
white dwarf stage. We find that most of the original H-rich material of the
post-AGB remnant is burnt during the post-LTP evolution, with the result that,
at entering its white dwarf cooling track, the remaining H envelope becomes
10^-6 Mo in agreement with asteroseismological inferences for some ZZ Ceti
stars.",2005-07-18T19:38:04Z
"""PAH"" emission bands in selected planetary nebulae: a study of the
  behaviour with gas phase C/O ratio","Airborne and space-based low-resolution spectroscopy in the 1980s discovered
tantalizing quantitative relationships between the gas phase C/O abundance
ratio in planetary nebulae (PNe) and the fractions of total far-infrared
luminosity radiated by the 7.7 and 11.3 micron bands (the C=C stretch and C-H
bend, respectively), of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Only a very small
sample of nebulae was studied in this context, limited by airborne observations
of the 7.7 micron band, or the existence of adequate IRAS Low Resolution
Spectrometer data for the 11.3 micron band. To investigate these trends
further, we have expanded the sample of planetaries available for this study
using Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) low-resolution spectra secured with the
Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) and the Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS).
The new sample of 43 PNe, of which 17 are detected in PAH emission, addresses
the range from C/O=0.2-13 with the objective of trying to delineate the
pathways by which carbon dust grains might have formed in planetaries. For the
7.7-micron and 11.3- micron bands, we confirm that the ratio of band strength
to total infrared luminosity is correlated with the nebular C/O ratio.
Expressed in equivalent width terms, the cut-on C/O ratio for the 7.7-micron
band is found to be 0.6(+0.2,-0.4), in good accord with that found from
sensitive ground-based measurements of the 3.3-micron band too.",2005-07-08T16:56:17Z
The Current Flows in Pulsar Magnetospheres,"The global structure of the current flows in pulsar magnetospheres is
investigated, with rough calculations of the elements in the magnetospheric
circuit. It is emphasized that the potential of critical field lines is the
same as that of interstellar medium, and that the pulsars whose rotation axes
and magnetic dipole axes are parallel should be positively charged, in order to
close the pulsar's current flows. The statistical relation between the radio
luminosity and pulsar's electric charge (or the spindown power) may hint that
the millisecond pulsars could be low-mass bare strange stars.",2005-07-19T04:21:40Z
Formation of HD molecules in merging dark matter haloes,"HD molecules can be an important cooling agent of the primordial gas behind
the shock waves originated through mergings of the dark matter haloes at epochs
when first luminous objects were to form. We study the necessary conditions for
the HD cooling to switch on in the low temperature range $T<200$ K. We show
that these conditions are fulfiled in merging haloes with the total (dark
matter and baryon) mass in excess of $M_{\rm cr}\sim 10^7[(1+z)/20]^{-2}\msun$.
Haloes with masses $M>M_{\rm cr}$ may be the sites of low-mass star formation.",2005-05-31T11:28:48Z
"The IMF in Extreme Star-Forming Environments: Searching for Variations
  vs. Initial Conditions","Any predictive theory of star formation must explain observed variations (or
lack thereof) in the initial mass function. Recent work suggests that we might
expect quantitative variations in the IMF as a function of metallicity (Larson
2005) or magnetic field strength (Shu et al. 2004). We summarize results from
several on-going studies attempting to constrain the ratio of high to low mass
stars, as well as stars to sub- stellar objects, in a variety of different
environments, all containing high mass stars.
  First, we examine the ratio of stars to sub--stellar objects in the nearby
Mon R2 region utilizing NICMOS/HST data. We compare our results to the IMF by
Kroupa (2002)]} and to the observed ratios for IC 348 and Orion. Second, we
present preliminary results for the ratio of high to low mass stars in W51, the
most luminous HII region in the galaxy. Based on ground--based multi--colour
images of the cluster obtained with the MMT adaptive optics system, we derive a
lower limit to the ratio of high-mass to low-mass stars and compare it to the
ratios for nearby clusters.
  Finally, we present the derived IMF for the R136 region in the LMC where the
metallicity is 1/4 solar using HST/NICMOS data. We find that the IMF is
consistent with that characterizing the field (Chabrier 2003), as well as
nearby star--forming regions, down to 1.0 Msun outside 2 pc. Whereas the
results for both Mon R2 and R136 are consistent with the nearby clusters, the
ratio of high to low mass stars in W51 tentatively indicates a lack of
low--mass objects.",2005-06-14T21:12:10Z
"Pair winds in Schwarzschild space-time with application to hot bare
  strange stars","We consider a time dependent, spherically outflowing wind, in Schwarzschild
space-time, consisting of electron-positron pairs and photons . Without
assuming thermal equilibrium, we account for the microphysics, including
two-body processes and their radiative three-body variants. We present a
finite-difference scheme for solving the general relativistic kinetic Boltzmann
equations for electron-positron pairs and photons. We apply this to the
concrete example of a wind from a hot, bare, strange star, predicted to be a
powerful source of hard X-ray photons and pairs created by the Coulomb barrier
at the quark surface. We study the kinetics of the wind particles and the
emerging emission in photons and pairs for stationary winds with total
luminosities in the range 10^{34}-10^{39} ergs/s, for different values of the
injected photon-to-pair ratio. The wind parameters--such as the mean optical
depth for photons, the rates of particle number and energy outflows, bulk
velocity, and number density of the pair plasma--are presented as functions of
the distance from the stellar surface, as well as characteristics of the
emergent radiation. We find that photons dominate in the emerging emission, and
the emerging photon spectrum is rather hard and differs substantially from the
thermal spectrum expected from a neutron star with the same luminosity. This
might help distinguish the putative bare strange stars from neutron stars.",2005-06-27T14:35:28Z
"Stellar Winds and Embedded Star Formation in the Galactic Center
  Quintuplet and Arches Clusters: Multifrequency Radio Observations","A multi-frequency, multi-configuration study has been made of the compact
radio sources in the Galactic Center Quintuplet and Arches stellar clusters
using the Very Large Array. Ten radio sources have been detected in the
Quintuplet cluster. The majority of these radio sources have rising spectral
indices and are positionally coincident with young massive stars that are known
to have powerful stellar winds. We conclude that the three most compact of
these sources are produced by stellar wind emission; thus, mass-loss rates can
be derived and have an average value of 3 x 10^-5 solar masses/year. The
remainder of the sources are likely to be a combination of stellar wind
emission and free-free emission from surrounding ionized gas. In three cases,
the radio sources have no stellar counterpart and the radio emission is thought
to arise from compact or ultra-compact HII regions. If so, these sources would
be the first detections of embedded massive stars to be discovered in the
Galactic center clusters. The radio nebula associated with the Pistol star
resembles the nebula surrounding the LBV star Eta Carina and may be related to
the stellar wind of the Pistol star. Ten compact radio sources are detected in
the Arches cluster and are interpreted to be stellar wind sources, consistent
with previous findings. Several of the sources show moderate variability
(10-30%) in their flux density, possibly related to a nonthermal component in
the wind emission. A number of radio sources in both clusters have X-ray
counterparts, which have been interpreted to be the shocked, colliding winds of
massive binary systems.",2005-08-08T16:47:09Z
The Low-Redshift Lyman Alpha Forest toward PKS 0405-123,"We present STIS 7km/s resolution data of the Ly-a forest toward PKS0405-123
(z=0.574). We make two samples. The strong sample (60 systems) has column
density logNHI>13.3 over 0.002<z<0.423, and the weak sample (44) has
logNHI>13.1 at 0.020<z<0.234; 7 absorbers show metals, all with OVI, but often
offset in velocity from HI. The strong sample Doppler parameters show
<b>=47+-22km/s; for the weak, <b>=44+-21km/s. Line blending and s/n effects
likely inflate b. The redshift density dN/dz is consistent with previous, lower
resolution results for logNHI>14.0. For 13.1<logNHI<14.0, we find a dN/dz
overdensity of ~0.2-0.3 dex at 0.127<z<0.234, which we believe arises from
cosmic variance. We find Ly-a clustering over Delta v<250km/s for logNHI>13.3,
consistent with a numerical model. There is a void in the strong sample at
0.0320<z<0.0814. We detect radial velocity correlations for Delta v<250km/s
between Ly-a absorbers and 39 galaxies in a 10' field. The correlation grows
with minimum NHI, peaking for logNHI ~> 13.5-14.0. The strength is similar to
that of the galaxy-galaxy correlation for our sample, implying that such Ly-a
systems have mass log M/Msun= 11.3+1.0-0.6. Including lower column density
systems in the sample shows correlations only out to Delta v <125km/s, as would
be expected for smaller density perturbations. Galaxy counts and local HI
column density appear correlated, peaking at ~5000km/s. We also give column
densities for Galactic species. (Abridged)",2005-05-29T21:40:21Z
"The same physics underlying SGRs, AXPs, and radio pulsars","Unexpected sign, significant magnitude and time-variation of frequency second
derivative exist not only in singular radio pulsars but also in Soft Gamma
repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). This paper shows that the
these phenomena are related, and can be interpreted by a simple unified model,
long-term orbital effect. Thus many of previous ``isolated'' pulsars may be
binary pulsars, i.e., orbital period
  $P_b\approx(47, 72)$min for AXP 1E 2259+586, and $P_b\approx (20, 34)$min for
PSR J1614-5047, $P_b\approx (3.6, 6.4)$min for SGR 1900+14, and $P_b\approx
(1.5, 5.8)$min for SGR 1806-20. In addition to X-ray pulsar, 1E 1207.4-5209,
these two SGRs may be the new ultra-compact binary pulsars with orbital period
of a few minutes. There might be more binary pulsars that suitable for
gravitational wave detection than we had thought.",2005-04-07T03:07:10Z
Anti-solar differential rotation,"The differential rotation of anti-solar type detected by observations for
several stars may result from a fast meridional flow. The sufficiently
intensive meridional circulation may be caused by large-scale thermal
inhomogeneities or, perhaps, by tidal forcing from a companion star. First
results of simulations of the anti-solar rotation of a giant star with
magnetically induced thermal inhomogeneities are presented. Perspectives for
observational check of the theory are discussed.",2005-04-07T08:48:17Z
Swift observations of GRB050128: the early X-ray afterglow,"Swift discovered GRB050128 with the Burst Alert Telescope and promptly
pointed its narrow field instruments to monitor the afterglow. X-ray
observations started 108 s after the trigger time. The early decay of the
afterglow is relatively flat with a temporal decay modeled with a power law
with index ~ -0.3. A steepening occurs at later times (~ 1500 s) with a power
law index of ~ -1.3. During this transition, the observed X-ray spectrum does
not change. We interpret this behaviour as either an early jet break or
evidence for a transition from the fast cooling regime to the slow cooling
regime in a wind environment.",2005-04-14T15:53:48Z
"IRAC Mid-Infrared Imaging of the Hubble Deep Field South: Star Formation
  Histories and Stellar Masses of Red Galaxies at z>2","We present deep 3.6 - 8 micron imaging of the Hubble Deep Field South with
IRAC on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We study Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs) at
z>2 selected by Js - Ks > 2.3 and compare them to a sample of Lyman Break
Galaxies (LBGs) at z=2-3. The observed UV-to-8 micron spectral energy
distributions are fit with stellar population models to constrain star
formation histories and derive stellar masses. We find that 70% of the DRGs are
best described by dust-reddened star forming models and 30% are very well fit
with old and ``dead'' models. Using only the I - Ks and Ks - 4.5 micron colors
we can effectively separate the two groups. The dead systems are among the most
massive at z~2.5 (mean stellar mass <M*> = 0.8 x 10^11 Msun) and likely formed
most of their stellar mass at z>5. To a limit of 0.5 x 10^11 Msun their number
density is ~10 x lower than that of local early-type galaxies. Furthermore, we
use the IRAC photometry to derive rest-frame near-infrared J, H, and K fluxes.
The DRGs and LBGs together show a large variation (a factor of 6) in the
rest-frame K-band mass-to-light ratios (M/L_K), implying that even a Spitzer 8
micron-selected sample would be very different from a mass-selected sample. The
average M/L_K of the DRGs is about three times higher than that of the LBGs,
and DRGs dominate the high-mass end. The M/L_K ratios and ages of the two
samples appear to correlate with derived stellar mass, with the most massive
galaxies being the oldest and having the highest mass-to-light ratios, similar
as found in the low-redshift universe.",2005-04-08T23:53:26Z
"A Link between Prompt Optical and Prompt Gamma-Ray Emission in Gamma-Ray
  Bursts","The prompt optical emission that arrives with gamma-rays from a cosmic
gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a signature of the engine powering the burst, the
properties of the ultra-relativistic ejecta of the explosion, and the ejecta's
interactions with the surroundings. Until now, only GRB 990123 had been
detected at optical wavelengths during the burst phase. Its prompt optical
emission was variable and uncorrelated with the prompt gamma-ray emission,
suggesting that the optical emission was generated by a reverse shock arising
from the ejecta's collision with the surrounding material. Here we report
prompt optical emission from GRB 041219a. It is variable and correlated with
the prompt gamma-rays, indicating a common origin for the optical light and the
gamma-rays. Within the context of the standard fireball model of GRBs, we
attribute this new optical component to internal shocks driven into the burst
ejecta by variations of the inner engine. The correlated optical emission is a
direct probe of the jet isolated from the medium. The timing of the
uncorrelated optical emission is strongly dependent on the nature of the
medium.",2005-03-23T22:59:26Z
"Long-Term Radio Modulation in Sagittarius A* from Spin-Induced Disk
  Precession","There is some evidence, though yet unconfirmed, that Sagittarius A*--the
supermassive black hole at the Galactic center--emits its radio waves modulated
with a ~100-day period. What is intriguing about this apparent
quasi-periodicity is that, though the amplitude of the modulation increases
with decreasing wavelength (from 3.6 to 1.3 cm), the quasi-period itself does
not seem to depend on the frequency of the radiation. It is difficult to
imagine how a binary companion, were that the cause of this modulation, could
have escaped detection until now. Instead, it has been suggested that the
spin-induced precession of a disk surrounding a slowly rotating black hole
could have the right period to account for this behavior. In this paper, we
examine how Sagittarius A*'s light curve could be modulated by this mechanism.
We demonstrate that the partial occultation of a nonthermal halo by a compact,
radio-opaque disk does indeed produce the observed frequency-dependent
amplitude. This appears to be in line with other observational arguments
suggesting that Sagittarius A*'s mm/sub-mm spectrum is produced by a ~10
Schwarzschild-radius disk, whereas its cm-waves originate from a nonthermal
particle distribution in a halo extending out to over 20 Schwarzschild radii.
Interestingly, this model suggests that the observed period corresponds to half
the precession period and that a non-axisymmetric disk could produce a second
period roughly twice as long as the first.",2005-05-17T20:56:32Z
Hot Neutron and Quark Star Evolution,"The physics of compact objects is one of the very actively developing
branches of theoretical investigations, since the careful analysis of different
models for the internal structure of these objects, their evolutionary
characteristics and the comparison with modern observational data give access
to discriminate among various speculations about the state of matter under
extreme conditions.
  The lecture provides an overview to the problem of neutron star cooling
evolution. We discuss the scheme and necessary inputs for neutron star cooling
simulations from the background of a microscopic modeling in order to present
the surface temperature - age characteristics of hybrid neutron stars including
the determination of main regulators of the cooling process, the question of
neutrino production and diffusion.",2005-06-16T23:19:01Z
"Black Hole Masses and Host Galaxy Evolution of Radio-loud Active
  Galactic Nuclei","We report stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of 28 AGN
host galaxies including our previous work. Using the mass-dispersion
($M_{\bullet}-\sigma$) and the fundamental plane relations, we estimate the
black hole mass for a sample of 66 BL Lac objects and investigate the role of
black hole mass in the energetics of BL Lac objects. The black hole mass range
for different BL Lac spectral types is similar, $10^{7} < M_{\bullet} < 4
\times 10^{9}$. Neither X-ray nor radio luminosity correlates with black hole
mass. Low-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects have higher Eddington ratios on
average, because of either more beaming or higher intrinsic power. For the
black hole mass range $3 \times 10^{7} < M_{\bullet} < 10^{9}$, the radio
luminosity of BL Lac objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars spans over 4
orders of magnitude, with BL Lac objects being low-power AGNs. We also
investigate the evolution of host galaxies for 39 AGNs out to $z \approx 0.5$
with measuredstellar velocity dispersions. Comparing the mass-to-light ratio
evolution in the observed frame with population synthesis models, we find that
single burst star formation models with $z_{form} = 1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.2} $ are
consistent with the observations. From our $z_{form}=1.4$ model, we estimated
the intrinsic mass-to-light ratio evolution in the Cousins $R$ band, $\Delta
log (M/L)/ \Delta z = -0.502 \pm 0.08$, consistent with that of normal early
type galaxies.",2005-06-14T19:16:41Z
"Closing in on a Short-Hard Burst Progenitor: Constraints from Early-Time
  Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy of a Possible Host Galaxy of GRB 050509b","The localization of the short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 050509b was a
watershed event. Thanks to the nearly immediate relay of the GRB position by
Swift, we began imaging the GRB field 8 minutes after the burst and continued
for the following 8 days. No convincing optical/infrared candidate afterglow or
supernova was found for the object. We present a re-analysis of the XRT
afterglow and find an absolute position that is ~4"" to the west of the XRT
position reported previously. Close to this position is a bright elliptical
galaxy with redshift z=0.2248, about 1' from the center of a rich cluster of
galaxies. Based on positional coincidences, the GRB and the bright elliptical
are likely to be physically related. We thus have discovered evidence that at
least some short-duration, hard-spectra GRBs arise at cosmological distances.
However, while GRB 050509b was underluminous compared to long-duration GRBs, we
demonstrate that the ratio of the blast-wave energy to the gamma-ray energy is
consistent with that of long-duration GRBs. Based on this analysis, on the
location of the GRB (40 +- 13 kpc from a bright galaxy), on the galaxy type
(elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there is
now observational consistency with the hypothesis that short-hard bursts arise
during the merger of a compact binary. We limit the properties of a
Li-Paczynski ''mini-supernova.'' Other progenitor models are still viable, and
additional rapidly localized bursts from the Swift mission will undoubtedly
help to further clarify the progenitor picture. (abridged)",2005-05-24T18:27:28Z
"Photometric Periodicities of Be/X-ray Pulsars in the Small Magellanic
  Cloud","Analysis of the longterm photometric variability of 7 Be/X-ray-pulsar systems
in the Small Magellanic Cloud has been carried out. We find a variety of types
of variability are present, including: longterm irregular changes, periodic
orbital outbursts due to interaction between the stars (weeks to months),
low-amplitude quasi-periodic variations of the equatorial disk (days), and
nonradial pulsations of the Be primary star (hours). This is the first time
nonradial pulsations have been identified in Be/X-ray binaries, although they
were previously known in some single Be stars.",2005-06-29T16:06:40Z
Flavoring Astrophysical Neutrinos: Flavor Ratios Depend on Energy,"Electromagnetic (and adiabatic) energy losses of pions and muons modify the
flavor ratio (measured at Earth) of neutrinos produced by pion decay in
astrophysical sources, $\Phi_{\nu_e}:\Phi_{\nu_\mu}:\Phi_{\nu_\tau}$, from
1:1:1 at low energy to 1:1.8:1.8 at high energy. The transition occurs over 1-2
decades of nuetrino energy, and is correlated with a modification of the
neutrino spectrum. For gamma-ray bursts, e.g., the transition is expected at
\~100 TeV, and may be detected by km-scale neutrino telescopes. Measurements of
the transition energy and energy-width will provide unique probes of the
physics of the sources. pion and muon energy losses also affect the ratio of
$\bar\nu_e$ flux to total neutrino flux, which may be measured at the
W-resonance (6.3 PeV): It is modified from 1/6 (1/15) at low energy to 1/9
(practically 0) at high energy for neutrinos produced in pp ($p\gamma$)
interactions.",2005-07-26T16:21:25Z
"Cooling of Quark Stars in the Color Superconductive Phase: Effect of
  Photons from Glueball decay","The cooling history of a quark star in the color superconductive phase is
investigated. Here we specifically focus on the 2-flavour color (2SC) phase
where novel process of photon generation via glueball (GLB) decay have been
already investigated (Ouyed & Sannino 2001). The picture we present here can in
principle be generalized to quark stars entering a superconductive phase where
similar photon generation mechanisms are at play. As much as 10^{45}-10^{47}
erg of energy is provided by the GLB decay in the 2SC phase. The generated
photons slowly diffuse out of the quark star keeping it hot and radiating as a
black-body (with possibly a Wien spectrum in gamma-rays) for millions of years.
We discuss hot radio-quiet isolated neutron stars in our picture (such as RX
J185635-3754 and RX J0720.4-3125) and argue that their nearly blackbody spectra
(with a few broad features) and their remarkably tiny hydrogen atmosphere are
indications that these might be quark stars in the color superconductive phase
where some sort of photon generation mechanism (reminiscent of the GLB decay)
has taken place. Fits to observed data of cooling compact stars favor models
with superconductive gaps of Delta_2SC = 15-35 MeV and densities
rho_2SC=(2.5-3.0)rho_N (rho_N being the nuclear matter saturation density) for
quark matter in the 2SC phase. If correct, our model combined with more
observations of isolated compact stars could provide vital information to
studies of quark matter and its exotic phases.",2005-04-18T14:41:46Z
"Nuclear Properties of Nearby Spiral Galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope
  NICMOS imaging and STIS Spectroscopy","We investigate the central regions of 23 spiral galaxies using archival
NICMOS imaging and STIS spectroscopy. The sample is taken from our program to
determine the masses of central massive black holes (MBH) in 54 nearby spiral
galaxies. Stars are likely to contribute significantly to any dynamical central
mass concentration that we find in our MBH program and this paper is part of a
series to investigate the nuclear properties of these galaxies. We use the
Nuker law to fit surface brightness profiles, derived from the NICMOS images,
to look for nuclear star clusters and find possible extended sources in 3 of
the 23 galaxies studied (13 per cent). The fact that this fraction is lower
than that inferred from optical Hubble Space Telescope studies is probably due
to the greater spatial resolution of those studies. Using R-H and J-H colors
and equivalent widths of H-alpha emission (from the STIS spectra) we
investigate the nature of the stellar population with evolutionary models.
Under the assumption of hot stars ionizing the gas, as opposed to a weak AGN,
we find that there are young stellar populations (~10-20 Myr) however these
data do not allow us to determine what percentage of the total nuclear stellar
population they form. Also, in an attempt to find any unknown AGN we use [N II]
and [S II] line flux ratios (relative to H-alpha) and find tentative evidence
for weak AGN in NGC 1300 and NGC 4536.",2005-03-31T12:22:12Z
The tidal stripping of satellites,"We present an improved analytic calculation for the tidal radius of
satellites and test our results against N-body simulations.
  The tidal radius in general depends upon four factors: the potential of the
host galaxy, the potential of the satellite, the orbit of the satellite and
{\it the orbit of the star within the satellite}. We demonstrate that this last
point is critical and suggest using {\it three tidal radii} to cover the range
of orbits of stars within the satellite. In this way we show explicitly that
prograde star orbits will be more easily stripped than radial orbits; while
radial orbits are more easily stripped than retrograde ones. This result has
previously been established by several authors numerically, but can now be
understood analytically. For point mass, power-law (which includes the
isothermal sphere), and a restricted class of split power law potentials our
solution is fully analytic. For more general potentials, we provide an equation
which may be rapidly solved numerically. Over short times ($\simlt 1-2$ Gyrs
$\sim 1$ satellite orbit), we find excellent agreement between our analytic and
numerical models. Over longer times, star orbits within the satellite are
transformed by the tidal field of the host galaxy. In a Hubble time, this
causes a convergence of the three limiting tidal radii towards the prograde
stripping radius. Beyond the prograde stripping radius, the velocity dispersion
will be tangentially anisotropic.",2005-06-28T09:45:49Z
"Further empirical evidence for the non-linearity of the
  period-luminosity relations as seen in the Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids","(abridged) Recent studies, using OGLE data for LMC Cepheids in the optical,
strongly suggest that the period-luminosity (PL) relation for the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids shows a break or non-linearity at a period of
10 days. In this paper we apply statistical tests, the chi-square test and the
F-test, to the Cepheid data from the MACHO project to test for a non-linearity
of the V- and R-band PL relations at 10 days, and extend these tests to the
near infrared (JHK-band) PL relations with 2MASS data. We correct the
extinction for these data by applying an extinction map towards the LMC. The
statistical test we use, the F-test, is able to take account of small numbers
of data points and the nature of that data on either side of the period cut at
10 days. With our data, the results we obtained imply that the VRJH-band PL
relations are non-linear around a period of 10 days, while the K-band PL
relation is (marginally) consistent with a single-line regression. The choice
of a period of 10 days, around which this non-linearity occurs, is consistent
with the results obtained when this ""break"" period is estimated from the data.
Long period Cepheids are supplemented from the literature to increase our
sample size. The photometry of these long period Cepheids is compared with our
data and no trend with period is found. Our main results remain unchanged when
we supplement our dataset with these long period Cepheids. By examining our
data at maximum light, we also suggest arguments why errors in reddening are
unlikely to be responsible for our results. The non-linearity of the mean
V-band PL relation as seen in both of the OGLE and MACHO data, using different
extinction maps, suggests that this non-linearity is real.",2005-07-26T13:34:44Z
"Rights and wrongs of the Hipparcos data: A critical assessment of the
  Hipparcos catalogue","A critical assessment of the quality of the Hipparcos data, partly supported
by a completely new analysis of the raw data, is presented with the aim of
clarifying reliability issues that have surfaced since the publication of the
Hipparcos catalogue in 1997. A number of defects in the data are identified,
such as scan-phase discontinuities and effects of external hits. These defects
can be repaired when re-reducing the raw data. Instabilities in the
great-circle reduction process are recognised and identified in a number of
data sets. These resulted mainly from the difficult observing conditions
imposed by the anomalous orbit of the satellite. The stability of the basic
angle over the mission is confirmed, but the connectivity between the two
fields of view has been less than optimal for some parts of the sky. Both are
fundamental conditions for producing absolute parallaxes. Although there is
clear room for improvement of the Hipparcos data, the catalogue as published
remains generally reliable within the quoted accuracies. Some of the findings
presented here are also relevant for the forthcoming Gaia mission.",2005-05-20T09:03:32Z
"The metal enrichment of elliptical galaxies in hierarchical galaxy
  formation models","We investigate the metal enrichment of elliptical galaxies in the framework
of hierarchical models of galaxy formation. The semi-analytical model we use in
this Letter, which has been used to study the metal enrichment of the
intracluster medium (ICM) by Nagashima et al., includes the effects of flows of
gas and metals both into and out of galaxies and the processes of metal
enrichment due to both type Ia and type II supernovae. We adopt a solar
neighbourhood IMF for star formation in discs, but consider models in which
starbursts have either a solar neighbourhood IMF or a top-heavy IMF. We find
that the alpha-element abundance in ellipticals is consistent with observed
values only if the top-heavy IMF is used. This result is consistent with our
previous study on the metal enrichment of the ICM. We also discuss the
abundance ratio of alpha elements to iron as a function of velocity dispersion
and metallicity. We find that models with a top-heavy IMF match the alpha/Fe
ratios observed in typical L_* ellipticals, but none of the models reproduce
the observed increase of alpha/Fe with velocity dispersion.",2005-04-27T20:47:21Z
"New photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk
  315","We present new important results about the intermediate-type Seyfert galaxy
Mrk 315, recently observed through optical imaging and integral-field
spectroscopy. Broad-band images were used to study the morphology of the host
galaxy, narrow-band H-alpha images to trace the star forming regions, and
middle-band [O III] images to evidence the distribution of the highly ionised
gas. Some extended emission regions were isolated and their physical properties
studied by means of flux calibrated spectra. High resolution spectroscopy was
used to separate different kinematic components in the velocity fields of gas
and stars. Some peculiar features characterise this apparently undisturbed and
moderately isolated active galaxy. Such features, already investigated by other
authors, are re-analysed and discussed in the light of these new observations.
The most relevant results we obtained are: the multi-tiers structure of the
disc; the presence of a quasi-ring of regions with star formation much higher
than previous claims; a secondary nucleus confirmed by a stellar component
kinematically decoupled by the main galaxy; a new hypothesis about the
controversial nature of the long filament, initially described as hook-shaped,
and more likely made of two independent filaments caused by interaction events
between the main galaxy and two dwarf companions.",2005-03-22T11:04:21Z
Branes in Supernova Shells,"This paper is firstly intended to review shortly the most recent developments
and ideas resulting from the necessity of having a scale at which gravitation
to unify the other fundamental forces. With the declared intention of
predicting an {\it in situ} distinct possibility for Kaluza-Klein gravitons
formation in the supernova shell we are using state of the art simulations
\citep{langer,ud1,ud2,ud3} for massive stellar winds to infer that the
supernova shock which will hit such winds will meet a non-isotropic and
non-homogeneous matter distribution with a very distinct geometry. By linking
this to the mechanism of particle shock acceleration at cosmic ray energies
(Fermi acceleration) and the related spallation in the wind shell, the result
is the creation of proper conditions for Kaluza-Klein gravitons formation in
the supernova shell from neutrino secondary particles (cosmic ray spallation
products) interacting with $\sim 10^{18}$ eV cosmic rays.",2005-05-25T11:24:47Z
"GRBs Optical follow-up observation at Lulin observatory, Taiwan","The Lulin GRB program, using the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) in Taiwan
started in July 2003. Its scientific aims are to discover optical counterparts
of XRFs and short and long GRBs, then to quickly observe them in multiple
bands. Thirteen follow-up observations were provided by LOT between July 2003
and Feb. 2005. One host galaxy was found at GRB 031203. Two optical afterglows
were detected for GRB 040924 and GRB 041006. In addition, the optical
observations of GRB 031203 and a discussion of the non-detection of the optical
afterglow of GRB 031203 are also reported in this article.",2005-06-10T15:45:08Z
"Transrelativistic Synchrotron Emissivity, Cross-Section, and
  Polarization","The spectrum and polarization produced by particles spiraling in a magnetic
field undergo dramatic changes as the emitters transition from nonrelativistic
to relativistic energies. However, none of the currently available methods for
calculating the characteristics of this radiation field are adequate for the
purpose of sustaining accuracy and speed of computation in the intensity, and
none even attempt to provide a means of determining the polarization fraction
other than in the cyclotron or synchrotron limits. But the transrelativistic
regime, which we here find to lie between $5\times 10^7$ K and $5\times 10^9$ K
for a thermal plasma, is becoming increasingly important in high-energy
astrophysical environments, such as in the intra-cluster medium, and in the
accretion flows of supermassive black holes. In this paper, we present simple,
yet highly accurate, fitting formulae for the magnetobremsstrahlung (also known
as cyclo-synchrotron) emissivity, its polarization fraction (and content), and
the absorption cross-section. We demonstrate that both the harmonic and
high-energy limiting behavior are well represented, incurring at most an error
of $\sim 5%$ throughout the transition region.",2005-05-06T22:39:43Z
Hubble Space Telescope Spectroscopy of the Balmer lines in Sirius B,"Sirius B is the nearest and brightest of all white dwarfs, but it is very
difficult to observe at visible wavelengths due to the overwhelming scattered
light contribution from Sirius A. However, from space we can take advantage of
the superb spatial resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope to resolve the A
and B components. Since the closest approach in 1993, the separation between
the two stars has become increasingly favourable and we have recently been able
to obtain a spectrum of the complete Balmer line series for Sirius B using
HST?s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The quality of the STIS
spectra greatly exceed that of previous ground-based spectra, and can be used
to provide an important determination of the stellar temperature (Teff =
25193K) and gravity (log g = 8.556). In addition we have obtained a new, more
accurate, gravitational red-shift of 80.42 +/- 4.83 km s-1 for Sirius B.
Combining these results with the photometric data and the Hipparcos parallax we
obtain new determinations of the stellar mass for comparison with the
theoretical mass-radius relation. However, there are some disparities between
the results obtained independently from log g and the gravitational redshift
which may arise from flux losses in the narrow 50x0.2arcsec slit. Combining our
measurements of Teff and log g with the Wood (1995) evolutionary mass-radius
relation we get a best estimate for the white dwarf mass of 0.978 M. Within the
overall uncertainties, this is in agreement with a mass of 1.02 M obtained by
matching our new gravitational red-shift to the theoretical M/R relation.",2005-06-24T15:25:20Z
"The environment of dwarf spheroidal satellites; ram pressure, tides and
  external radiation fields","We discuss the role of environmental mechanisms in the evolution of dwarf
galaxy satellites using high-resolution N-Body+SPH simulations that include
simultaneously tidal forces, ram pressure and heating from ionizing radiation
fields. Tidally induced bar-buckling instabilities can transform a rotating
disky dwarf into a pressure supported spheroidal. Efficient gas removal
requires instead a combination of tidal mass loss and ram pressure stripping in
a diffuse gaseous corona around the primary system. The efficiency of ram
pressure depends strongly on how extended the gas remains during the evolution.
Bar driven inflows that tend to drive the gas to the bottom of the potential
well can be opposed by the heating from ultraviolet radiation. We show that
even fairly massive dwarfs ($V_{peak} >$ 30 km/s) would be stripped of their
gas over a few Gyr if they enter the Milky Way halo at $z > 2$ thanks to the
effect of the cosmic UV background. Gas mass loss can be much faster, occurring
in less than 1 Gyr, if dwarf satellites have their first close approach with
the primary at the epoch of bulge formation. Indeed at that time the primary
galaxy should have a FUV luminosity comparable to that of major present-day
starbursts, resulting in a local radiation field even more intense than the
cosmic background.",2005-05-04T12:40:57Z
"Astrophysical Implications of Turbulent Reconnection: from cosmic rays
  to star formation","Turbulent reconnection allows fast magnetic reconnection of astrophysical
magnetic fields. This entails numerous astrophysical implications and opens new
ways to approach long standing problems. I briefly discuss a model of turbulent
reconnection within which the stochasticity of 3D magnetic field enables rapid
reconnection through both allowing multiple reconnection events to take place
simultaneously and by restricting the extension of current sheets. In fully
ionized gas the model in Lazarian and Vishniac 99 predicts reconnection rates
that depend only on the intensity of turbulence. In partially ionized gas a
modification of the original model in Lazarian, Vishniac and Cho 04 predicts
the reconnection rates that, apart from the turbulence intensity depend on the
degree of ionization. In both cases the reconnection may be slow and fast
depending on the level of turbulence in the system. As the result, the
reconnection gets bursty, which provides a possible explanation to Solar flares
and possibly to gamma ray busts. The implications of the turbulent reconnection
model have not been yet studied in sufficient detail. I discuss first order
Fermi acceleration of cosmic ray that takes place as the oppositely directed
magnetic fluxes move together. This acceleration would work in conjunction with
the second order Fermi acceleration that is caused by turbulence in the
reconnection region. In partially ionized gas the stochastic reconnection
enables fast removal of magnetic flux from star forming molecular clouds.",2005-05-28T22:52:54Z

"Runaway electromagnetic cascade in shear flows and high energy radiation
  of astrophysical jets","We propose a straightforward and efficient mechanism of the high energy
emission of astrophysical jets associated with an exchange of interacting high
energy photons between the jet and external environment and vice versa.
Interactions which play the main role in this mechanism, are e^+ e^- pair
production by photons and inverse Compton scattering. The process has been
studied with numerical simulations demonstrating that under reasonable
conditions it has a supercritical character: high energy photons breed
exponentially being fed directly by the bulk kinetic energy of the jet.
Eventually, there is a feedback of particles on the fluid dynamics and the jet
partially decelerates.",2005-06-15T17:02:48Z
Non-Gaussianity from Cosmic Magnetic Fields,"Magnetic fields in the early universe could have played an important role in
sourcing cosmological perturbations. While not the dominant source, even a
small contribution might be traceable through its intrinsic non-Gaussianity.
Here we calculate analytically the one, two and three point statistics of the
magnetic stress energy resulting from tangled Gaussian fields, and confirm
these with numerical realizations of the fields. We find significant
non-Gaussianity, and importantly predict higher order moments that will appear
between the scalar, vector and tensor parts of the stress energy (e.g.
scalar-tensor-tensor moments). Such higher order cross correlations are a
generic feature of non-linear theories and could prove to be an important probe
of the early universe.",2005-06-24T11:06:12Z
"Measurement of the Energy Release Rate and the Reconnection Rate in
  Solar Flares","By using the method presented by Isobe et al. (2002), the non-dimensional
reconnection rate Vin/Va has been determined for the impulsive phase of three
two-ribbon flares, where Vin is the velocity of the reconnection inflow and Va
is the Alfven velocity. The non-dimensional reconnection rate is important to
make a constraint on the theoretical models of magnetic reconnection. In order
to reduce the uncertainty of the reconnection rate, it is important to
determine the energy release rate of the flares from observational data as
accurately as possible. To this end, we have carried out one dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of a flare loop and synthesized the count rate
detected by the soft X-ray telescope (SXT) aboard Yohkoh satellite. We found
that the time derivative of the thermal energy contents in a flare arcade
derived from SXT data is smaller than the real energy release rate by a factor
of 0.3 - 0.8, depending on the loop length and the energy release rate. The
result of simulation is presented in the paper and used to calculate the
reconnection rate. We found that reconnection rate is 0.047 for the X2.3 flare
on 2000 November 24, 0.015 for the M3.7 flare on 2000 July 14, and 0.071 for
the C8.9 flare on 2000 November 16. These values are similar to that derived
from the direct observation of the reconnection inflow by Yokoyama et al.
(2001), and consistent with the fast reconnection models such as that of
Petschek (1964).",2005-07-13T16:42:05Z
"Gamma-Ray Bursts and the Earth: Exploration of Atmospheric, Biological,
  Climatic and Biogeochemical Effects","Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are likely to have made a number of significant
impacts on the Earth during the last billion years. We have used a
two-dimensional atmospheric model to investigate the effects on the Earth's
atmosphere of GRBs delivering a range of fluences, at various latitudes, at the
equinoxes and solstices, and at different times of day. We have estimated DNA
damage levels caused by increased solar UVB radiation, reduction in solar
visible light due to $\mathrm{NO_2}$ opacity, and deposition of nitrates
through rainout of $\mathrm{HNO_3}$. For the ``typical'' nearest burst in the
last billion years, we find globally averaged ozone depletion up to 38%.
Localized depletion reaches as much as 74%. Significant global depletion (at
least 10%) persists up to about 7 years after the burst. Our results depend
strongly on time of year and latitude over which the burst occurs. We find DNA
damage of up to 16 times the normal annual global average, well above lethal
levels for simple life forms such as phytoplankton. The greatest damage occurs
at low to mid latitudes. We find reductions in visible sunlight of a few
percent, primarily in the polar regions. Nitrate deposition similar to or
slightly greater than that currently caused by lightning is also observed,
lasting several years. We discuss how these results support the hypothesis that
the Late Ordovician mass extinction may have been initiated by a GRB.",2005-05-23T13:14:53Z

The XMM-LSS survey: The XMDS/VVDS 4 sigma catalogue,"We present a first catalogue of X-ray sources resulting from the central area
of the XMM-LSS (Large Scale Structure survey). We describe the reduction
procedures and the database tools we developed and used to derive a well
defined catalogue of X-ray sources. The present catalogue is limited to a
sub-sample of 286 sources detected at 4 sigma in the 1 deg^2 area covered by
the photometric VVDS (VIRMOS VLT Deep Survey), which allows us to provide
optical and radio identifications. We also discuss the X-ray properties of a
larger X-ray sample of 536 sources detected at > 4 sigma in the full 3 deg^2
area of the XMM Medium Deep Survey (XMDS) independently of the optical
identification. We also derive the logN-logS relationship for a sample of more
than one thousand sources that we discuss in the context of other surveys at
similar fluxes.",2005-05-06T09:37:49Z
"The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation of Galaxies with Extended Rotation
  Curves and the Stellar Mass of Rotating Galaxies","I investigate the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for a sample of galaxies
with extended 21 cm rotation curves spanning the range 20 < Vf < 300 km/s. A
variety of scalings of the stellar mass-to-light ratio are considered. For each
prescription for M/L, I give fits of the form Md = A Vf^x. Presumably, the
prescription that comes closest to the correct value will minimize the scatter
in the relation. The fit with minimum scatter has A = 50 solar masses/(km/s)^4
and x = 4. This relation holds over five decades in mass. Galaxy color, stellar
fraction, and M/L are correlated with each other and with Md, in the sense that
more massive galaxies tend to be more evolved. There is a systematic dependence
of the degree of maximality of disks on surface brightness. High surface
brightness galaxies typically have M/L ~ 3/4 of the maximum disk value, while
low surface brightness galaxies typically attain ~ 1/4 of this amount.",2005-06-30T08:59:14Z
"VLT Spectroscopy of Globular Cluster Systems, II. Spectroscopic Ages,
  Metallicities, and [alpha/Fe] Ratios of Globular Clusters in Early-Type
  Galaxies","An analysis of ages, metallicities, and [alpha/Fe] ratios of globular cluster
systems in early-type galaxies is presented, based on Lick index measurements
summarized in Puzia et al. (2004, Paper I of this series). In the light of
calibration and measurement uncertainties, age-metallicity degeneracy, and the
relative dynamic range of Lick indices, as well as systematics introduced by
abundance ratio variations (in particular variations of [alpha/Fe] ratios), we
find that the most reliable age indicator for our dataset is a combination of
the Lick Balmer-line indices HgammaA, Hbeta, and HdeltaA. [MgFe]' is used as a
spectroscopic metallicity indicator which is least affected by [alpha/Fe]
variations. We introduce an interpolation routine to simultaneously derive
ages, metallicities, and [alpha/Fe] ratios from diagnostic grids constructed
from Lick indices. From a comparison of high-quality data with SSP model
predictions, we find that ~2/3 of the globular clusters in early-type galaxies
are older than 10 Gyr, up to 1/3 have ages in the range ~5-10 Gyr, and only a
few cluster are younger than ~5 Gyr. Our sample of globular clusters covers
metallicities from [Z/H] = -1.3 up to ~0.5 dex. We find that metal-rich
globular clusters show on average a smaller mean age and a larger age scatter
than their metal-poor counterparts. [alpha/Fe] diagnostic plots show that
globular cluster systems in early-type galaxies have super-solar alpha/Fe
abundance ratios with a mean [alpha/Fe] = 0.47+/-0.06 dex and a dispersion of
about 0.3 dex. We find evidence for a correlation between [alpha/Fe] and
metallicity, in the sense that more metal-rich clusters exhibit lower
alpha-element enhancements. [abridged]",2005-05-20T20:52:22Z
The infrared Hourglass cluster in M8,"A detailed study of the Hourglass Nebula in the M8 star forming region is
presented. The study is mainly based on recent subarcsec-resolution JHKs images
taken at Las Campanas Observatory and complemented with archival HST images and
longslit spectroscopy retrieved from the ESO Archive Facility. Using the new
numerical code CHORIZOS, we estimate the distance to the earliest stars in the
region to be 1.25 kpc. Infrared photometry of all the sources detected in the
field is given. From analysis of the JHKs colour-colour diagrams, we find that
an important fraction of these sources exhibit significant infrared excess.
These objects are candidates to be low- and intermediate-mass pre-main sequence
stars. Based on HST observations, the spatial distribution of gas, dust and
stars in the region is analyzed. The morphological analysis of these images
also reveals a rich variety of structures related to star formation (proplyds,
jets, bow shocks), similar to those observed in M16 and M42, along with the
detection of the first four Herbig-Haro objects in the region. Furthermore, a
longslit spectrum obtained with NTT confirms the identification of one of them
(HH 870) in the core of the Hourglass nebula, providing the first direct
evidence of active star formation by accretion in M8.",2005-06-22T23:53:25Z
Inflationary spectra and violations of Bell inequalities,"In spite of the macroscopic character of the primordial fluctuations, the
standard inflationary distribution (that obtained using linear mode equations)
exhibits inherently quantum properties, that is, properties which cannot be
mimicked by any stochastic distribution. This is demonstrated by a Gedanken
experiment for which certain Bell inequalities are violated. These violations
are {\it in principle} measurable because, unlike for Hawking radiation from
black holes, in inflationary cosmology we can have access to both members of
correlated pairs of modes delivered in the same state. We then compute the
effect of decoherence and show that the violations persist provided the
decoherence level (and thus the entropy) lies below a certain non-vanishing
threshold. Moreover, there exists a higher threshold above which no violation
of any Bell inequality can occur. In this regime, the distributions are
``separable'' and can be interpreted as stochastic ensembles of fluctuations.
Unfortunately, the precision which is required to have access to the quantum
properties is so high that, {\it in practice}, an observational verification
seems excluded.",2005-05-18T13:49:01Z
The Complex Wind Torus and Jets of PSR B1706-44,"We report on Chandra ACIS imaging of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) of the
young Vela-like PSR B1706-44, which shows the now common pattern of an
equatorial wind and polar jets. The structure is particularly rich, showing a
relativistically boosted termination shock, jets with strong confinement, a
surrounding radio/X-ray PWN and evidence for a quasi-static `bubble nebula'.
The structures trace the pulsar spin geometry and illuminate its possible
relation to SNR G343.1-2.3. We also obtain improved estimates of the pulsar
flux and nebular spectrum, constraining the system age and energetics.",2005-06-03T21:58:24Z
"Polarization of Quasars: Electron Scattering in the Broad Absorption
  Line Region","It is widely accepted that the broad absorption line region (BALR) exists in
most (if not all) quasars with a small covering factor. Recent works showed
that the BALR is optically thick to soft and even medium energy X-rays, with a
typical hydrogen column density of a few 10$^{23}$ to $>$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$.
The electron scattering in the thick absorber might contribute significantly to
the observed continuum polarization for both BAL QSOs and non-BAL QSOs. In this
paper, we present a detailed study of the electron scattering in the BALR by
assuming an equatorial and axisymmetric outflow model. Monte-Carlo simulations
are performed to correct the effect of the radiative transfer. Assuming an
average covering factor of 0.2 of the BALR, which is consistent with
observations, we find the electron scattering in the BALR with a column density
of $\sim$ 4 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ can successfully produce the observed
average continuum polarization for both BAL QSOs and non-BAL QSOs. The observed
distribution of the continuum polarization of radio quiet quasars (for both BAL
QSOs and non-BAL QSOs) is used to constrain the dispersal distribution of the
BALR. We find that, to match the observations, the maximum continuum
polarization produced by the BALR (while viewed edge-on) peaks at $P$ = 0.34%,
which is much smaller than the average continuum polarization of BAL QSOs ($P$
= 0.93%). The discrepancy can be explained by a selection bias that the BAL
with larger covering factor, and thus producing larger continuum polarization,
is more likely to be detected. A larger sample of radio quiet quasars with
accurate measurement of the continuum polarization will give better constraints
to the distribution of the BALR properties.",2005-08-02T08:36:08Z
"Near room temperature X-ray and Gamma ray spectroscopic detectors for

hard X-ray spectroscopy detectors for ASTROSAT and other future Indian space
science missions.We have studied a Si-PIN detector in the energy range 5 - 60
keV and CZT & CdTe Schottky diode detectors in the energy region 10 - 1330 keV.
We have studied large area (64 cm$^2$) CZT pixel detectors with pixel size
close to the small CZT detector. We have studied individual pixels as well as
CZT detector as a whole (summed over all the 1024 pixels). The energy
resolution behaviour of the large area CZT detector is similar to that of small
diode detectors in the low energy region. The change in operating temperature
from room temperature ~20 to ~70$ degree C drastically affects both the energy
resolutionas well as the peak area due to a sharp rise in the thermal
noise.These results suggest that the cooling of detector system will provide
better energy resolution as well as detection efficiency.",2005-07-07T05:17:05Z
"Probing the birth of the first quasars with the future far infrared
  mission","It is now widely recognised that massive black holes must have had a
fundamental influence on the formation of galaxies and vice versa. With current
and imminent missions we aim to unravel much of this relationship for the last
10 Gyr of cosmic history, while the quasar population waned and star formation
died down. The picture at earlier times will be more difficult to reconstruct,
but will likely be even more exciting: when the first stars shone, the first
dust was formed, and quasars were a vigorously rising population. One of the
primary goals of XEUS is to allow us to find and study the earliest quasars,
however deeply buried in gas and dust they may be. But to understand fully the
astrophysical context of these objects, their significance in the grand
picture, we must learn how they relate to their environments and their host
galaxies. The ESA future Far-InfraRed Mission (FIRM) will provide much of the
data we require, revealing the dust heated by star formation in the host
galaxy, the relative evolutionary stages of spheroid and black hole, and the
total energy budgets posessed by these first quasars. FIRM will reveal star
formation in the immediate proto-cluster environment of the quasar and so tell
us how the formation of the first galaxies and quasars coupled to the earliest
large scale structures.",2005-08-01T12:42:39Z
Molecular Hydrogen in the Damped Ly alpha Absorber of Q1331+170,"We used HST/STIS to obtain the spectrum of molecular hydrogen associated with
the damped Ly$\alpha$ system at $z_{\rm abs}=1.7765$ toward the quasar
Q1331+170 at $z_{\rm em}=2.084$. Strong ${\rm H}_2$ absorption was detected,
with a total ${\rm H}_2$ column density of $N({\rm H}_2)=(4.45\pm 0.36)\times
10^{19} {\rm cm^{-2}}$.The molecular hydrogen fraction is $f_{{\rm
H}_2}=\frac{2N_{\rm H_2}}{N_{\rm HI}+2N_{\rm H_2}}=(5.6\pm 0.7)%$, which is the
greatest value reported so far in any redshifted damped Ly$\alpha$ system. This
results from the combined effect of a relatively high dust-to-gas ratio, a low
gas temperature, and an extremely low ambient UV radiation field. Based on the
observed population of $J$ states, we estimate the photo-absorption rate to be
$R_{\rm abs}=(7.6\pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13} {\rm s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a
local UV radiation field of $J(1000{\rm \AA})\approx 2.1\times 10^{-3}
J_{1000{\rm \AA},\odot}$, where $J_{1000{\rm \AA},\odot}$ is the UV intensity
at $1000 \AA$ in the solar neighborhood. This is comparable with the
metagalactic UV background intensity at this redshift, and implies an extremely
low star formation rate in the absorber's environment. The observed CO-to-H$_2$
column density ratio is $\frac{N_{\rm CO}}{N_{\rm H_2}}<2.5\times 10^{-7}$,
which is similar to the value measured for diffuse molecular clouds in the
Galactic ISM. Finally, applying the inferred physical conditions to the
observed C I fine structure excitation (Songaila {\it et al.} 1994), we
estimate the cosmic microwave background temperature to be $T_{\rm CMB}=(7.2\pm
0.8) {\rm K}$ at $z=1.77654$, consistent with the predicted value of $7.566
{\rm K}$ from the standard cosmology.",2005-06-30T18:02:39Z
High mass X-ray binaries in the SMC: the luminosity function,"We study population of compact X-ray sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud
using the archival data of XMM-Newton observatory. The total area of the survey
is ~1.5 square degrees with the limiting sensitivity of ~10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2,
corresponding to the luminosity of ~4.3\cdot 10^{33} erg/s at the SMC distance.
Out of ~150 point sources detected in the 2--8 keV energy band, ~3/4 are
background CXB sources, observed through the SMC. Based on the properties of
the optical and near-infrared counterparts of the detected sources we
identified likely HMXB candidates, and sources, whose nature is uncertain,
thus, providing a lower and upper limits on the luminosity distribution of
HMXBs in the observed part of the SMC.
  The observed number of HMXBs is consistent with the prediction based on SFR
estimates derived from the supernovae frequency and analysis of color-magnitude
diagrams of the stellar population. If, on the contrary, the true value of the
SFR is better represented by FIR, H_alpha and UV based estimators, then the
abundance of HMXBs in the SMC may significantly (by a factor of as much as ~10)
exceed the value derived for the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies.
  The shape of the observed distribution at the bright end is consistent with
the universal HMXB XLF. At the faint end, L_X>2* 10^{34} erg/sec, the upper
limit on the luminosity function is consistent with while the lower limit is
significantly flatter than the L^{-0.6} power law.",2005-03-22T15:49:40Z
A deeper understanding of white dwarf interiors,"A detailed record of the physical processes that operate during
post-main-sequence evolution is contained in the internal chemical structure of
white dwarfs. Global pulsations allow us to probe the stellar interior through
asteroseismology, revealing the signatures of prior nuclear burning, mixing,
and diffusion in these stars. I review the rapid evolution of structural models
for helium-atmosphere variable (DBV) white dwarfs over the past five years, and
I present a new series of model-fits using recent observations to illustrate
the relative importance of various interior structures. By incorporating
physically motivated C/O profiles into double-layered envelope models for the
first time, I finally identify an optimal asteroseismic model that agrees with
both diffusion theory and the expected nuclear burning history of the
progenitor. I discuss the implications of this fundamental result, and I
evaluate the prospects for continued progress in the future.",2005-08-09T15:59:16Z
"Increase in the Absorption Length of Inclined Extensive Air Showers with
  Different Selection Types","The dependence of the number of extensive air showers (EAS) on the zenith
angle is obtained in groups with a constant solid-angle step with different
election types at separations between stations of 500 and 1000 m by using the
Yakutsk EAS array data. A bend point is formed at the zenith angle
approximately of 50 deg. This point shifts with the increasing energy in the
direction corresponding to the shift of the cascade-curve maximum depth with
the variation of energy. The boundaries of change of these dependences obtained
separately at the distances between stations of 500 and 1000 m are different
that may be caused by the uncertainty of the lateral distribution function
(LDF) used. Thereby, energies of showers detected by the stations with a
different separation are not joined.",2005-06-28T01:23:09Z
A Catalog of Distant Compact Groups Using DPOSS,"In this paper we present an objectively defined catalog of 459 small, high
density groups of galaxies out to z~0.2 in a region of 6260 square degrees in
the northern sky derived from the Digitized Second Palomar Observatory Sky
Survey. Our catalog extends down to r = 19.0 and has a median redshift of z_med
= 0.12, making it complementary to Hickson's catalog for the nearby universe
(z_med = 0.03). The depth and angular coverage of this catalog makes it
valuable for studies of the general characteristics of small groups of galaxies
and how galaxies evolve in and around them. We also examine the relationship
between compact groups and large scale structure.",2005-04-11T17:58:08Z
The SDSS-XMM Quasar Sample: First Results,"We have searched in the XMM-Newton public archive for quasars in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) First Data Release (DR1), and found 55 lying in the
field of a XMM-Newton observation with exposure times >20 ksec (as of August,
2004). The 35 quasars which yielded good X-ray spectra span redshifts from 0.5
to 2.5. The large collecting area of XMM-Newton allows us to investigate the
dependence of the X-ray spectra of quasars on luminosity, redshift and optical
colors. We find: (1) no evolution of X-ray slope Gamma with either redshift or
luminosity; (2) no correlation between Gamma or absorbing column density and
the optical to X-ray ratio, alpha_{OX}; (4) no relation between alpha_{OX} and
optical colors. The two latter results suggest that obscuration is not the
dominant cause of the spread in X-ray slope or optical color. We find four
unusual quasars, 10% of the sample: three are absorbed (N_H>10^{22} cm^{-2}),
of which one has high luminosity (1.5x10$^{44} erg/s); the fourth has
Gamma=0.6+-0.2, far flatter than the typical value of 1.8-2.0, and a strong
emission line (EW=1.2+-$0.4 keV) which, if Fe-K, implies a redshift of ~1.4.",2005-07-19T09:34:23Z
AGN-driven convection in galaxy-cluster plasmas,"This paper describes how active galactic nuclei can heat galaxy-cluster
plasmas by driving convection in the intracluster medium. A model is proposed
in which a central supermassive black hole accretes intracluster plasma at the
Bondi rate and powers a radio source. The central radio source produces cosmic
rays, which mix into the thermal plasma. The cosmic-ray luminosity is
proportional to the mass accretion rate. The cosmic-ray pressure gradient
drives convection, which causes plasma heating. It is assumed that plasma
heating balances radiative cooling. The plasma heating rate is self-regulating
because the Bondi accretion rate is a decreasing function of the specific
entropy near the cluster center; if heating exceeds cooling, then the central
entropy increases, the Bondi rate and cosmic-ray luminosity decrease, and the
convective heating rate is reduced. This paper focuses on the role of
intracluster magnetic fields, which affect convection by causing heat and
cosmic rays to diffuse primarily along magnetic field lines. A new stability
criterion is derived for convection in a thermal-plasma/cosmic-ray fluid, and
equations for the average fluid properties in a convective cluster are obtained
with the use of a nonlocal two-fluid mixing length theory. Numerical solutions
of the model equations compare reasonably well with observations without
requiring fine tuning of the model parameters.",2005-06-04T18:39:29Z
"Constraining fundamental stellar parameters using seismology.
  Application to Alpha Centauri AB","We apply the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm to seismic and
classical observables of the Alpha Cen binary system in order to derive the
fundamental parameters of Alpha Cen A+B and to analyze the dependence of these
parameters on the chosen observables, on their uncertainty and on the physics
used in stellar modelling. The seismological data are those by Bouchy & Carrier
(2002) for Alpha Cen A, and those by Carrier & Bourban (2003) for Alpha Cen B.
We show that while the fundamental stellar parameters do not depend on the
treatment of convection adopted (Mixing Length Theory -- MLT -- or ``Full
Spectrum of Turbulence'' -- FST), the age of the system depends on the
inclusion of gravitational settling, and is deeply biased by the small
frequency separation of component B.
  We try to answer the question of the universality of the mixing length
parameter, and we find a statistically reliable dependence of the
alpha--parameter on the HR diagram location (with a trend similar to the one
predicted by Ludwig et al.1999).
  We propose the frequency separation ratios introduced by Roxburgh &
Voronstsov (2003) as better observables to determine the fundamental stellar
parameters, and to use the large frequency separation and frequencies to
extract information about the stellar structure. The effects of diffusion and
equation of state on the oscillation frequencies are also studied, but present
seismic data do not allow their detection.",2005-05-26T14:04:41Z
Eruption of a Kink-Unstable Filament in Active Region NOAA 10696,"We present rapid-cadence Transition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE)
observations which show evidence of a filament eruption from active region NOAA
10696, accompanied by an X2.5 flare, on 2004 November 10. The eruptive
filament, which manifests as a fast coronal mass ejection some minutes later,
rises as a kinking structure with an apparently exponential growth of height
within TRACE's field of view. We compare the characteristics of this filament
eruption with MHD numerical simulations of a kink-unstable magnetic flux rope,
finding excellent qualitative agreement. We suggest that, while tether
weakening by breakout-like quadrupolar reconnection may be the release
mechanism for the previously confined flux rope, the driver of the expansion is
most likely the MHD helical kink instability.",2005-07-28T10:26:32Z
"Cosmic Ray Acceleration at the Forward Shock in Tycho's Supernova
  Remnant: Evidence from Chandra X-ray Observations","We present evidence for cosmic ray acceleration at the forward shock in
Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) from three X-ray observables: (1) the proximity
of the contact discontinuity to the forward shock, or blast wave, (2) the
morphology of the emission from the rim of Tycho, and (3) the spectral nature
of the rim emission. We determine the locations of the blast wave (BW), contact
discontinuity (CD), and reverse shock (RS) around the rim of Tycho's supernova
remnant using a principal component analysis and other methods applied to new
Chandra data. The azimuthal-angle-averaged radius of the BW is 251"". For the CD
and RS we find average radii of 241"" and 183"", respectively. Taking account of
projection effects, we find ratios of 1:0.93:0.70 (BW:CD:RS). We show these
values to be inconsistent with adiabatic hydrodynamical models of SNR
evolution. The CD:BW ratio can be explained if cosmic ray acceleration of ions
is occurring at the forward shock. The RS:BW ratio, as well as the strong Fe Ka
emission from the Tycho ejecta, imply that the RS is not accelerating cosmic
rays. We also extract radial profiles from ~34% of the rim of Tycho and compare
them to models of surface brightness profiles behind the BW for a purely
thermal plasma with an adiabatic shock. The observed morphology of the rim is
much more strongly peaked than predicted by the model, indicating that such
thermal emission is implausible here. Spectral analysis also implies that the
rim emission is non-thermal in nature, lending further support to the idea that
Tycho's forward shock is accelerating cosmic rays.",2005-07-20T14:57:12Z
X-ray emission from young brown dwarfs in the Orion Nebula Cluster,"We use the sensitive X-ray data from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project
(COUP) to study the X-ray properties of 34 spectroscopically-identified brown
dwarfs with near-infrared spectral types between M6 and M9 in the core of the
Orion Nebula Cluster. Nine of the 34 objects are clearly detected as X-ray
sources. The apparently low detection rate is in many cases related to the
substantial extinction of these brown dwarfs; considering only the BDs with
$A_V \leq 5$ mag, nearly half of the objects (7 out of 16) are detected in
X-rays. Our 10-day long X-ray lightcurves of these objects exhibit strong
variability, including numerous flares. While one of the objects was only
detected during a short flare, a statistical analysis of the lightcurves
provides evidence for continuous (`quiescent') emission in addition to flares
for all other objects. Of these, the $\sim$ M9 brown dwarf COUP 1255 = HC 212
is one of the coolest known objects with a clear detection of quiescent X-ray
emission. The X-ray properties (spectra, fractional X-ray luminosities, flare
rates) of these young brown dwarfs are similar to those of the low-mass stars
in the ONC, and thus there is no evidence for changes in the magnetic activity
around the stellar/substellar boundary, which lies at $\sim$ M6 for ONC
sources. Since the X-ray properties of the young brown dwarfs are also similar
to those of M6--M9 field stars, the key to the magnetic activity in very cool
objects seems to be the effective temperature, which determines the degree of
ionization in the atmosphere.",2005-06-02T08:40:21Z
The Faint End of the HI Mass Function,"We study the faint end of the HI mass function (HIMF) in order to test the
predictions of the CDM theory on the number density of objects with small
(dark) masses. The neutral hydrogen is much better tracer of the underlying
mass distribution compared to the luminous matter and can be used to test the
existence of a population of small galaxies in which the star formation has
been partially or completely suppressed during cosmic evolution. Due to
technical limitations, the existing HI surveys are not very sensitive to HI
masses below 10^8 M_sun. We designed a blind HI survey to be sensitive to
objects with small HI masses. The surveyed area is in the Canis Venatici groups
of galaxies and covers in total ~ 86 deg^2 of sky, with observed velocities in
the range -350 < cz < 1400 km/s. We detected 69 objects, 22 of them for the
first time in HI. All new HI detections fall in the lower part of the
mass-histogram, confirming our ability to detect galaxies with small HI masses.
The calculated HIMF is flat in the faint end regime (slope ~ -1), different
from the steep rise predicted by CDM models. Possible effects of the
environment on the estimated HIMF parameters are discussed.",2005-08-02T16:23:24Z
X-ray chemistry in envelopes around young stellar objects,"We present chemical models of the envelope of a young stellar object (YSO)
exposed to a central X-ray source. The models are applied to the massive
star-forming region AFGL 2591 for different X-ray fluxes. The total X-ray
ionization rate is dominated by the `secondary' ionization rate of H2 resulting
from fast electrons. The carbon, sulphur and nitrogen chemistries are
discussed. It is found that He+ and H3+ are enhanced and trigger a peculiar
chemistry. Several molecular X-ray tracers are found and compared to tracers of
the far ultraviolet (FUV) field. Like ultraviolet radiation fields, X-rays
enhance simple hydrides, ions and radicals. In contrast to ultraviolet photons,
X-rays can penetrate deep into the envelope and affect the chemistry even at
large distances from the source. Whereas the FUV enhanced species cover a
region of 200-300 AU, the region enhanced by X-rays is >1000 AU. Best-fit
models for AFGL 2591 predict an X-ray luminosity LX > 1e+31 ergs/s with a hard
X-ray spectrum TX > 3e+07 K. Furthermore, we find LX/Lbol ~ 1e-6. The chemistry
of the bulk of the envelope mass is dominated by cosmic-ray induced reactions
rather than by X-ray induced ionization for X-ray luminosities LX < 1e+33
ergs/s. The calculated line intensities of HCO+ and HCS+ show that high-J lines
are more affected than lower J lines by the presence of X-rays due to their
higher critical densities, and that such differences are detectable even with
large aperture single-dish telescopes. Future instruments such as Herschel-HIFI
or SOFIA will be able to observe X-ray enhanced hydrides whereas the
sensitivity and spatial resolution of ALMA is well-suited to measure the size
and geometry of the region affected by X-rays.",2005-06-14T13:44:56Z
"Accretion by the Secondary in Eta Carinae During the Spectroscopic
  Event: I. Flow Parameters","We examine the influence of the gravity of the companion (the secondary) to
the massive primary star Eta Carinae on the winds blown by the primary and the
secondary. The two winds collide with each other after passing through two
respective shock waves, and escape the system while strongly emitting in the
X-ray band. While during most of the 5.5 years orbital period, the companion's
gravity has a negligible effect on the winds, we find that near periastron, the
companion's gravity may significantly influence the flow and the companion
might accrete from the primary's wind under certain circumstances. Near
periastron passage, the collision region of the two winds may collapse onto the
secondary star, a process that could substantially reduce the X-ray luminosity.
We suggest that such an accretion process produces the long, almost flat, X-ray
minimum in Eta Carinae.",2005-05-11T03:37:47Z
The Spatial Orientation of Planetary Nebulae Within the Milky Way,"We analyze the spatial orientation of a homogenous sample of 440 elongated
Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in order to determine the orientation of their apparent
major axis respect to the Milky Way plane. We present some important
geometrical and statistical considerations that have been overlooked by the
previous works on the subject. The global distribution of galactic position
angles (GPA) of PNe is quantitatively not very different from a random
distribution of orientations in the Galaxy. Nevertheless we find that there is
at least one region on the sky, toward the galactic center, where a weak
correlation may exist between the orientation of the major axis of some PNe and
the Galactic equator, with an excess of axes with GPA$\sim 100^{\circ}$.
Therefore, we confirm that ``extrinsic'' phenomena (i.e., global galactic
magnetic fields, shell compression from motion relative to the Interstellar
Medium) do not determine the morphology of PNe on most of the sky, with a
possible exception towards the galactic center.",2005-05-05T11:17:24Z
"Detection of a young stellar population in the background of open
  clusters in the Third Galactic Quadrant","We report the detection of a young stellar population ($\leq$100 Myrs) in the
ba ckground of 9 young open clusters belonging to a homogenoeous sample of 30
star clusters in the Third Galactic Quadrant (at $217^o \leq l \leq 260^o$).
Deep and accurate UBVRI photometry allows us to measure model-independent age
and distance for the clusters and the background population with high
confidence. This population is exactly the same population (the Blue Plume)
recently detected in 3 intermediate-age open clusters and suggested to be a
$\leq$ 1-2 Gyr old population belonging to the Canis Major (CMa) over-density
(Bellazzini et al. 2004, Mart\'inez-Delgado et al. 2005). However, we find that
the young population in those three and in six clusters of our sample follows
remarkably well the pattern of the Norma-Cygnus spiral arm as defined by CO
clouds, while in the other three program clusters it lies in the Perseus arm.
We finally provide one example (out of 21) of a cluster which does not show any
background population, demonstrating that this population is not ubiquitous
toward CMa.",2005-08-02T21:43:46Z
Inflessence: a phenomenological model for inflationary quintessence,"We present a phenomenologically motivated model which is able to give rise
both to an inflationary epoch and to the present day cosmic acceleration. We
introduce an approach where the energy density depends on the scale factor $a$
in such a way that a smooth transition from the inflation to the matter
dominated era and then to the nowadays accelerated expansion is achieved. We
use the dimensionless coordinate distance $y(z)$ to the Gold Type Ia Supernovae
dataset and to a sample comprising 20 radio galaxies, the shift parameter
${\cal{R}}$ and the acoustic peak parameter ${\cal{A}}$ to test whether the
model is in agreement with observations and to constrain its main parameters.
As an independent cross check, we also compare model predictions with the
lookback time to galaxy clusters and the age of the universe. Although
phenomenologically inspired, the model may be theoretically motivated either
resorting to a scenario with a scalar and phantom fields (eventually
interacting) or as an effective description arising from higher order gravity
theories.",2005-06-16T07:21:46Z
"X-ray reflection in the Seyfert galaxy 1H0419-577 revealing strong
  relativistic effects in the vicinity of a Kerr black hole","We report results obtained from six XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert
galaxy 1H 0419-577. Here we show that the X-ray spectrum and variability are
well described by a two-component model comprising a power law with constant
spectral shape and variable normalisation and a much more constant ionised
reflection component from the inner accretion. One of the observations was
performed when the source was in a particularly low flux state in which the
X-ray spectrum is rather peculiar and exhibits a very flat hard spectrum with
broad residuals below 6.6 keV and a steep soft excess below about 1 keV. We
interpret the spectrum as being reflection-dominated by X-ray reprocessed
emission from the inner accretion disc. The primary continuum is almost
completely unobserved possibly because of strong light bending towards the
central black hole. The ionised reflection model simultaneously accounts for
the broad residuals and hard flat spectrum and for the soft excess. The same
model provides an excellent description of the data at all the other flux
levels, the most important difference being a variation in the power law
normalisation. Our results imply that most of the X-ray emission in this source
originates from within few gravitational radii from the central black hole and
requires that the compact object is an almost maximally spinning Kerr black
hole. (abridged)",2005-04-21T15:03:32Z
"Molecular Gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA): IV. Gravitational Torques
  and AGN Feeding","We discuss the efficiency of stellar gravity torques as a mechanism to
account for the feeding of the central engines of four low luminosity AGN:
NGC4321, NGC4826, NGC4579 and NGC6951. These galaxies have been observed as
part of the NUGA CO project, aimed at the study of AGN fueling mechanisms. Our
calculations allow us to derive the characteristic time-scales for gas flows
and discuss whether torques from the stellar potentials are efficient enough to
drain the gas angular momentum in the inner 1 kpc of these galaxies. Results
indicate paradoxically that feeding should be thwarted close to the AGN: in the
four cases analyzed, gravity torques are mostly positive inside r~200pc,
resulting in no inflow on these scales. As a possible solution for the paradox,
we speculate that the agent responsible for driving inflow to still smaller
radii is transient and thus presently absent in the stellar potential.
Alternatively, the gravity torque barrier associated with the ILR of the bars
in these galaxies could be overcome by other mechanisms that become competitive
in due time against gravity torques. We find that viscosity can counteract
moderate--to--low gravity torques on the gas if it acts on a nuclear ring of
high gas surface density contrast and a few 100pc size. We propose an
evolutionary scenario in which gravity torques and viscosity act in concert to
produce recurrent episodes of activity during the typical lifetime of any
galaxy. In this scenario the recurrence of activity in galaxies is indirectly
related to that of the bar instabilities.",2005-07-04T16:27:26Z
"Structural Parameters of Dwarf Galaxies in the Coma Cluster: On the
  Origin of dS0 Galaxies","In this paper we analyze the structural parameters of the dwarf galaxies in
the Coma cluster with $-18 \le M_{B} \le -16$ and classify them in two types:
those with surface brightness profiles well fitted by a single Sersic law were
called dwarf ellipticals (dEs), and those fitted with Sersic-plus-exponential
profiles were classified as dwarf lenticulars (dS0s). The comparison of the
structural parameters of the dwarf galaxies in the Coma and Virgo clusters
shows that they are analogous. Photometrically, the dE and dS0 galaxies in Coma
are equivalent, having similar colors and global scales. However, the scale of
the innermost parts (bulges) of dS0 galaxies is similar to the bulges of
late-type spiral galaxies. In contrast, dEs have larger scales than the bulges
of bright galaxies. This may indicate that dS0 and dE galaxies have different
origins. While dE galaxies can come from dwarf irregulars (dIs) or from similar
processes as bright Es, the origin of dS0 galaxies can be harassed bright
late-type spiral galaxies.",2005-04-25T15:40:23Z
"Gravitomagnetic Effects on Collective Plasma Oscillations in Compact
  Stars","The effects of gravitomagnetic force on plasma oscillations are investigated
using the kinetic theory of homogeneous electrically neutral plasma in the
absence of external electric or magnetic field. The random phase assumption is
employed neglecting the thermal motion of the electrons with respect to a fixed
ion background. It is found that the gravitomagnetic force reduces the
characteristic frequency of the plasma thus enhancing the refractive index of
the medium. The estimates for the predicted effects are given for a typical
white dwarf, pulsar, and neutron star.",2005-05-11T12:34:43Z
"Radiative transfer problem in dusty galaxies: iteration scaling
  approximation","We investigate the applicability and accuracy of the iteration scaling
approximation, proposed by Kylafis and Bahcall (1987). It is shown, that while
this method provides results sufficiently close to the exact solution of
radiative transfer problem, care must be taken in cases when the distribution
of interstellar dust significantly differs from that of light sources. The
problem is successfully circumvented by using the ratio of scattered light
distributions obtained in the first two iterations.",2005-04-27T19:45:33Z
"Age and Metallicity Estimations in Old Stellar Populations from
  Stromgren Photometry","We present a new technique to determine age and metallicity of old stellar
populations (globular clusters and elliptical galaxies) using an iterative
principal component analysis on narrow band (Str\""omgren) colors. Our technique
is capable of reproducing globular cluster [Fe/H] values to 0.02 dex and CMD
ages to 1.0 Gyrs. We also present preliminary results on the application of our
technique to a sample of high mass, field ellipticals and low mass, cluster
dwarf ellipticals. We confirm the results of earlier studies which find that
globular clusters increase in metallicity with age and that age and metallicity
increase with galaxy mass. However, we find that dwarf ellipticals deviate from
the elliptical sequence by having little to no correlation between age and
metallicity.",2005-04-29T19:41:28Z
A closer look at the spectrum and small scale anisotropies of UHECRs,"We present results of numerical simulations of the propagation of ultra high
energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) over cosmological distances, aimed at quantifying
the statistical significance of the highest energy data on the spectrum and
small scale anisotropies as detected by the AGASA experiment. We assess the
significance of the lack of a GZK feature and its compatibility with the
reported small scale anisotropies.
  Assuming that UHECRs are protons from extragalactic sources, we find that the
small scale anisotropies are incompatible with the reported spectrum at a
probability level of $2 \times 10^{-5}$. Our analysis of the AGASA results
shows the power of combining spectrum and small scale anisotropy data in future
high statistics experiments, such as Auger.",2005-07-13T15:37:46Z
Cosmic rays at ultra high energies (Neutrinos!),"Resonant photopion production with the cosmic microwave background predicts a
suppression of extragalactic protons above the famous Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin
cutoff at about E_{GZK} ~ 5 x 10^10 GeV. Current cosmic ray data measured by
the AGASA and HiRes Collaborations do not unambiguously confirm the GZK cutoff
and leave a window for speculations about the origin and chemical composition
of the highest energy cosmic rays. In this work we analyze the possibility of
strongly interacting neutrino primaries and derive model-independent
quantitative requirements on the neutrino-nucleon inelastic cross section for a
viable explanation of the cosmic ray data. Search results on weakly interacting
cosmic particles from the AGASA and RICE experiments are taken into account
simultaneously. Using a flexible parameterization of the inelastic
neutrino-nucleon cross section we find that a combined fit of the data does not
favor the Standard Model neutrino-nucleon inelastic cross section, but
requires, at 90 % confidence level, a steep increase within one energy decade
around E_{GZK} by four orders of magnitude. We illustrate such an enhancement
within some extensions of the Standard Model. The impact of new cosmic ray data
or cosmic neutrino search results on this scenario, notably from the Pierre
Auger Observatory soon, can be immediately evaluated within our approach.",2005-06-28T15:00:23Z
"Stellar Content from high resolution galactic spectra via Maximum A
  Posteriori","This paper describes STECMAP (STEllar Content via Maximum A Posteriori), a
flexible, non-parametric inversion method for the interpretation of the
integrated light spectra of galaxies, based on synthetic spectra of single
stellar populations (SSPs). We focus on the recovery of a galaxy's star
formation history and stellar age-metallicity relation. We use the high
resolution SSPs produced by PEGASE-HR to quantify the informational content of
the wavelength range 4000 - 6800 Angstroms.
  A detailed investigation of the properties of the corresponding simplified
linear problem is performed using singular value decomposition. It turns out to
be a powerful tool for explaining and predicting the behaviour of the
inversion. We provide means of quantifying the fundamental limitations of the
problem considering the intrinsic properties of the SSPs in the spectral range
of interest, as well as the noise in these models and in the data.
  We performed a systematic simulation campaign and found that, when the time
elapsed between two bursts of star formation is larger than 0.8 dex, the
properties of each episode can be constrained with a precision of 0.04 dex in
age and 0.02 dex in metallicity from high quality data (R=10 000,
signal-to-noise ratio SNR=100 per pixel), not taking model errors into account.
  The described methods and error estimates will be useful in the design and in
the analysis of extragalactic spectroscopic surveys.",2005-05-10T20:07:07Z
Regularized energy-dependent solar flare hard x-ray spectral index,"The deduction from solar flare X-ray photon spectroscopic data of the energy
dependent model-independent spectral index is considered as an inverse problem.
Using the well developed regularization approach we analyze the energy
dependency of spectral index for a high resolution energy spectrum provided by
Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The regularization
technique produces much smoother derivatives while avoiding additional errors
typical of finite differences. It is shown that observations imply a spectral
index varying significantly with energy, in a way that also varies with time as
the flare progresses. The implications of these findings are discussed in the
solar flare context.",2005-06-05T18:22:56Z
A New delta N Formalism for Multi-Component Inflation,"The delta N formula that relates the final curvature perturbation on comoving
slices to the inflaton perturbation on flat slices after horizon crossing is a
powerful and intuitive tool to compute the curvature perturbation spectrum from
inflation. However, it is customarily assumed further that the conventional
slow-roll condition is satisfied, and satisfied by all components, during
horizon crossing. In this paper, we develop a new delta N formalism for
multi-component inflation that can be applied in the most general situations.
This allows us to generalize the idea of general slow-roll inflation to the
multi-component case, in particular only applying the general slow-roll
condition to the relevant component. We compute the power spectrum of the
curvature perturbation in multi-component general slow-roll inflation, and find
that under quite general conditions it is invertible.",2005-06-13T05:29:51Z
AGN feedback and gas mixing in the core of NGC 4636,"Chandra observations of NGC 4636 show disturbances in the galaxy X-ray halo,
including arm-like high surface brightness features (tentatively identified as
AGN driven shocks) and a possible cavity on the west side of the galaxy core.
We present Chandra and XMM spectral maps of NGC 4636 which confirm the presence
of the cavity and show it to be bounded by the arm features. The maps also
reveal a ~15 kpc wide plume of low temperature, high abundance gas extending
25-30 kpc to the southwest of the galaxy. The cavity appears to be embedded in
this plume, and we interpret the structure as being entrained gas drawn out of
the galaxy core during previous episodes of AGN activity. The end of the plume
is marked by a well defined edge, with significant falls in surface brightness,
temperature and abundance, indicating a boundary between galaxy and
group/cluster gas. This may be evidence that as well as preventing gas cooling
through direct heating, AGN outbursts can produce significant gas mixing,
disturbing the temperature structure of the halo and transporting metals out
from the galaxy into the surrounding intra-group medium.",2005-03-25T16:51:37Z
High-energy Astrophysics and the Virtual Observatory,"The Virtual Observatory (VO) will revolutionise the way we do Astronomy by
allowing easy access to all astronomical data and by making the handling and
analysis of datasets at various locations across the globe much simpler and
faster. I report here on the need for the VO and its status in Europe,
concentrating on the recently started EURO-VO project, and then give two
specific applications of VO tools to high-energy astrophysics.",2005-07-26T08:27:38Z
Two new ZZ Ceti pulsators from the HS and HE surveys,"We report the detection of nonradial g-mode oscillations in the DA white
dwarfs HS1039+4112 (B=15.9) and HE1429-0343 (B=15.8) from time-series
photometry made at the Loiano 1.5 m telescope. The two stars were previously
selected as probable pulsators based on two-color photometry and spectral
analysis respectively. Following our temperature and surface gravity
determinations, HS1039+4112 (Teff=11200 K, logg=8.2) is located near the red
edge of the ZZ Ceti instability strip, whereas HE1429-0343 (Teff=11400 K,
logg=7.8) falls in the middle of the strip. Both stars show a multi-mode
behavior with the main periods at about 850 and 970 s respectively, and
relatively large amplitudes (~7% and ~2.5%).",2005-06-10T08:44:43Z
Photometric Accretion Signatures Near the Substellar Boundary,"Multi-epoch imaging of the Orion equatorial region by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey has revealed that significant variability in the blue continuum persists
into the late-M spectral types, indicating that magnetospheric accretion
processes occur below the substellar boundary in the Orion OB1 association. We
investigate the strength of the accretion-related continuum veiling by
comparing the reddening-invariant colors of the most highly variable stars
against those of main sequence M dwarfs and evolutionary models. A gradual
decrease in the g band veiling is seen for the cooler and less massive members,
as expected for a declining accretion rate with decreasing mass. We also see
evidence that the temperature of the accretion shock decreases in the very low
mass regime, reflecting a reduction in the energy flux carried by the accretion
columns. We find that the near-IR excess attributed to circumstellar disk
thermal emission drops rapidly for spectral types later than M4. This is likely
due to the decrease in color contrast between the disk and the cooler stellar
photosphere. Since accretion, which requires a substantial stellar magnetic
field and the presence of a circumstellar disk, is inferred for masses down to
0.05 Msol we surmise that brown dwarfs and low mass stars share a common mode
of formation.",2005-06-27T21:47:59Z
"SDSS J124058.03-015919.2: A new AM CVn star with a 37-minute orbital
  period","We present high time resolution VLT spectroscopy of SDSS J124058.03-015919.2,
a new helium-transferring binary star identified in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. We measure an orbital period of 37.355+/-0.002 minutes, confirming the
AM CVn nature of the system. From the velocity amplitudes of the accretor and
the accretion stream--disc impact, we derive a mass ratio q=0.039+/-0.010. Our
spectral coverage extends from 3700A--9500A and shows the presence of helium,
nitrogen, silicon and iron in the accretion disc, plus the redshifted,
low-velocity ""central spikes"" in the helium lines, known from the low-state AM
CVn stars GP Com and CE 315. Doppler tomography of the helium and silicon
emission lines reveals an unusual pattern of two bright emission sites in the
tomograms, instead of the usual one emission site identified with the impact of
the mass stream into the accretion disc. One of the two is preferred as the
conventional stream--disc impact point in velocity space, at the 3-sigma
confidence level. We speculate briefly on the origin of the second.",2005-05-17T21:17:47Z
Large-Scale Anisotropy of EGRET Gamma Ray Sources,"In the course of its operation, the EGRET experiment detected high-energy
gamma ray sources at energies above 100 MeV over the whole sky. In this
communication, we search for large-scale anisotropy patterns among the
catalogued EGRET sources using an expansion in spherical harmonics, accounting
for EGRET's highly non-uniform exposure. We find significant excess in the
quadrupole and octopole moments. This is consistent with the hypothesis that,
in addition to the galactic plane, a second mid-latitude (5^{\circ} < |b| <
30^{\circ}) population, perhaps associated with the Gould belt, contributes to
the gamma ray flux above 100 MeV.",2005-06-24T14:11:14Z
Abundance Anomalies in NGC6752 - Do AGB Stars Have a Role?,"We are in the process of testing a popular theory that the observed abundance
anomalies in the Globular Cluster NGC 6752 are due to `internal pollution' from
intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch stars. To this end we are using a
chemical evolution model incorporating custom-made stellar evolution yields
calculated using a detailed stellar evolution code. By tracing the chemical
evolution of the intracluster gas, which is polluted by two generations of
stars, we are able to test the internal pollution scenario in which the Na- and
Al-enhanced ejecta from intermediate mass stars is either accreted onto the
surfaces of other stars, or goes toward forming new stars.
  In this paper we focus mainly on the nucleosynthetic yields of the AGB stars
and discuss whether these stars are the source of the observed Na-O
anticorrelation. Comparing our preliminary results with observational data
suggests that the qualitative theory is not supported by this quantitative
study.",2005-05-18T14:05:13Z
109 new Galactic open clusters,"We present a list of 130 Galactic Open Clusters, found in the All-Sky
Compiled Catalogue of 2.5 Million Stars (ASCC-2.5). For these clusters we
determined and publish a homogeneous set of astrophysical parameters such as
size, membership, motion, distance and age. In a previous work 520 already
known open clusters out of the sample of 1700 clusters from the literature were
confirmed in the ASCC-2.5 using independent, objective methods. Using these
methods the whole sky was systematically screened for the search of new
clusters. The newly detected clusters show the same distribution over the sky
as the known ones. It is found, that without the {\em a-priori} knowledge about
existing clusters our search lead to clusters which are, {\em on average},
brighter, have more members and cover larger angular radii than the 520
previously known ones.",2005-05-02T13:33:38Z
The puzzling case of GRB 990123: multiwavelength afterglow study,"We report on the BeppoSAX data analysis of the afterglow of Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) 990123, one of the brightest GRBs detected by BeppoSAX. Mainly due to its
exceptional brightness, this is the only source for which the Wide Field
Cameras have allowed an early detection of the X-ray afterglow between about 20
and 60 min after the GRB trigger. Besides, again for the first time,
high-energy emission from the afterglow was detected up to 60 keV. For the
X-ray afterglow we found a power-law decay with index alpha = 1.46 +/- 0.04;
the spectrum has a power-law shape with photon index Gamma about 1.9. The
backward extrapolation of the afterglow decay smoothly reconnects with the late
GRB emission, thus suggesting that both emissions are produced by the same
phenomenon. An extensive set of multiwavelength observations for the GRB 990123
afterglow made during the BeppoSAX pointing was collected from the literature.
The hard X-ray to radio range coverage allowed to construct a spectral flux
distribution and to perform an analysis of the GRB afterglow in the context of
the ""fireball"" model. We also report the results of temporal and spectral
analysis of an X-ray source serendipitously observed about 22 arcmin north of
the GRB afterglow, along with the optical spectroscopy of its possible
counterpart to establish the nature of this source.",2005-04-27T15:14:48Z
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of (Non-magnetic) Cataclysmic Variables,"HST and FUSE have provided high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra of a
variety of cataclysmic variables and have allowed a detailed characterization
of FUV emission sources in both high and low states. Here, I describe how this
has advanced our understanding of non-magnetic CVs and the substantial
interpretive challenges still posed by the observations. In the high state, the
FUV spectra are dominated by disk emission that is modified by scattering in
high and low velocity material located above the disk photosphere. Progress is
being made toward reproducing the high-state spectra using kinematic
prescriptions of the velocity field and new ionization and radiative transfer
codes. In conjunction with hydrodynamical simulations of the outflows, accurate
estimates of the mass loss rates and determination of the launching mechanism
are likely forthcoming. In quiescence, the FUV spectra reveal contributions
from the WD and the disk. Quantitative analyses have lead to solid measurements
of the temperatures and abundances of a number of WDs in CVs, and of a
determination of the response of the WD to an outburst. Basic challenges exist
in terms of understanding the other components of the emission in quiescence,
however, and these are needed to better understand the structure of the disk
and the physical mechanisms resulting in ongoing accretion in quiescence.",2005-06-21T17:23:13Z
Evolution of X-ray emission from young massive star clusters,"The evolution of X-ray emission from young massive star clusters is modeled,
taking into account the emission from the stars as well as from the cluster
wind. It is shown that the level and character of the soft (0.2-10 keV) X-ray
emission change drastically with cluster age and are tightly linked with
stellar evolution. Using the modern X-ray observations of massive stars we show
that the correlation between bolometric and X-ray luminosity known for single O
stars also holds for O+O and O+Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries. The diffuse emission
originates from the cluster wind heated by the kinetic energy of stellar winds
and supernova explosions. To model the evolution of the cluster wind, the mass
and energy yields from a population synthesis are used as input to a
hydrodynamic model. It is shown that in a very young clusters the emission from
the cluster wind is low. When the cluster evolves, WR stars are formed. Their
strong stellar winds power an increasing X-ray emission of the cluster wind.
Subsequent supernova explosions pump the level of diffuse emission even higher.
Clusters at this evolutionary stage may have no X-ray bright stellar point
sources, but a relatively high level of diffuse emission. A supernova remnant
may become a dominant X-ray source, but only for a short time interval of a few
thousand years. We retrieve and analyse Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of
six massive star clusters located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our model
reproduces the observed diffuse and point-source emission from these LMC
clusters, as well as from the Galactic clusters Arches, Quintuplet and NGC
3603.",2005-05-25T14:20:56Z
"Force-Free Magnetohydrodynamic Waves: Non-Linear Interactions and
  Effects of Strong Gravity","The propagation and non-linear interactions of magnetohydrodynamic waves are
considered in the force-free limit, where the inertia of the conducting matter
which enforces the MHD condition E.B = 0 can be neglected in comparison with
the inertia of the electromagnetic field. By extending the analysis beyond the
WKB approximation, we are able to study the non-linearities induced by a
gravitational field. We treat the perturbed electromagnetic field as a fluid of
infinite conductivity. We calculate the scattering of a torsional (Alfven) wave
by a gravitational potential, and demonstrate a nonlinear coupling with a
compressive (fast) wave which is second order in the amplitude of the Alfven
wave. In a cylindrically symmetric spacetime with slow rotation, the coupling
is second order in g_{t\phi} and first order in the amplitude of the wave. We
also give a fresh analysis of the non-linear interactions between compressive
and torsional waves in Minkowski space, with a focus on the relative strengths
of their three- and four-mode interactions. In contrast with non-relativistic
magnetofluids, the effects of compression are always present. In the case of
colliding fast waves, a net displacement of the field lines across (at least)
one of the colliding wavepackets is shown to have a strong effect on the
outgoing waveform, and to have a qualitatively different interpretation than
was previously suggested for colliding Alfven waves. Finally, we show how
spacetime curvature modifies the collision between two torsional waves, in both
the weak- and strong-field regimes.",2005-07-17T01:06:18Z
"Accretion Disc Structure and Orientation in the Lensed and Microlensed
  Q0957+561 Quasar","Because quasars are unresolved in optical imaging, their structures must
presently be inferred. Gravitational microlensing offers the possibility to
produce information about the luminous structure provided the Einstein ring
diameter of the microlensing particle is comparable to or smaller than the
radiating quasar components. The long brightness history measured for the Q0957
quasar has been analyzed previously for information about the microlensing
particles, and evidence for the existence of a cosmologically significant
population of planetary mass particles has been reported. The microlensing
results have also directly determined the sizes of the ultraviolet light
emitting surfaces in the quasar Autocorrelation analysis of the same brightness
record has produced evidence for complex structure in the quasar; if the quasar
suddenly brightens today, it is probable that it will brighten again after 129,
190, 540, and 620 days. We interpret these lags as the result of luminous
structure around the quasar, and in particular we interpret them in the context
of the Elvis (2000) model of the quasar's structure. We find that the
autocorrelation peaks imply that beyond the luminous inner edge of the
accretion disc, the biconic structures of the Elvis model must lie at a radial
distance of 2x10^17 cm from the black hole, and 2x10^16 cm above and below the
plane of the accretion disc. The quasar is apparently inclined 55 degrees to
the line of sight. A second possible solution with lower inclination and larger
structure is also indicated but statistically less probable.",2005-04-18T19:01:52Z
"Late Arriving Particles in Cosmic Ray Air Showers and AGASA's
  Determination of UHECR Energies","We give the first detailed study of the arrival time distribution of nucleons
in UHECR air showers. We analyze in detail the influence of late arriving
particles on the energy determination of the AGASA experiment, as well as how
the arrival time distribution changes with distance from shower core. Our
calculations are consistent with experimental observations of the AGASA group.
Crucial to obtaining agreement, is the correct implementation of the energy
loss for low-energy protons. We confirm AGASA's estimation of the error in
their energy determination associated with late-arriving particles, assuming
primary protons.",2005-06-08T15:45:45Z
"An Infalling Torus of Molecular Gas Around the Ultra-Compact HII Region
  G28.20-0.05","We present new observations of the ultra-compact HII region G28.20-0.05 in 23
GHz continuum, and the NH3(1,1), NH3(2.2), and NH3(3,3) lines. To explain the
complicated kinematics of the molecular gas, we propose a model consisting of
two components. One component is an infalling, equatorial torus of molecular
gas, whose dense central region has been ionized to form the ultra-compact HII
region. The second component is a larger expanding molecular shell driven by
some type of wide-angle outflow or wind. We estimate that the infall component
includes more than 18 Msun of molecular gas. We calculate the central mass to
be 79 Msun, probably comprising more than one star. The arrangement of the
molecular material suggests a connection to the other disk-like structures seen
around massive young stars. The central star in this case is more massive, and
the whole region may be more evolved than other similar objects such as IRAS
20126+4104, IRAS 18089-1732, G192.16-3.84, and AFGL5142.",2005-06-02T14:32:25Z
"The Double Pulsar J0737--3039: Testing the Neutron Star Equation of

laboratory for testing fundamental physics. Here we demonstrate that the low
measured mass of Pulsar B can be used to constrain the equation of state of
neutron star matter {\em under the assumption} that it formed in an
electron-capture supernova. We show that the observed orbital parameters as
well as the likely evolutionary history of the system support such a hypothesis
and discuss future refinements that will improve the constraints this test may
provide.",2005-06-23T17:55:04Z
The Recent and Continuing Assembly of Field Ellipticals by Red Mergers,"We present a study of tidal debris associated with 126 nearby red galaxies
selected from the MUSYC and NDWFS surveys. In the full sample 67 galaxies (53%)
show morphological signatures of tidal interactions, consisting of broad fans
of stars, tails, and other asymmetries at very faint surface brightness levels.
When restricting the sample to the 86 bulge-dominated early-type galaxies the
fraction of tidally disturbed galaxies rises to 71%, which implies that for
every ``normal'' undisturbed elliptical there are two which show clear signs of
interactions. The tidal features are red and smooth, and often extend over >50
kpc. Of the tidally distorted galaxies about 2/3 are remnants and 1/3 are
interacting with a companion galaxy. The companions are usually bright red
galaxies as well: the median R-band luminosity ratio of the tidal pairs is
0.31, and the median color difference after correcting for the slope of the
color-magnitude relation is -0.02 in B-R. If the ongoing mergers are
representative for the progenitors of the remnants ~35% of bulge-dominated
galaxies experienced a merger with mass ratio >1:4 in the recent past. With
further assumptions it is estimated that the present-day mass accretion rate of
galaxies on the red sequence is 0.09+-0.04 per Gyr. For a constant or
increasing mass accretion rate with redshift, we find that red mergers may lead
to an evolution of a factor of >~2 in the stellar mass density in luminous red
galaxies over the redshift range 0<z<1, consistent with recent studies of the
evolution of the luminosity density. We conclude that most of today's field
elliptical galaxies were assembled at low redshift through ""dry"" mergers of
gas-poor, bulge-dominated systems. [ABRIDGED]",2005-06-27T20:00:16Z
"STEllar Content and Kinematics from high resolution galactic spectra via
  Maximum A Posteriori","We introduce STECKMAP (STEllar Content and Kinematics via Maximum A
Posteriori), a method to recover the kinematical properties of a galaxy
simultaneously with its stellar content from integrated light spectra. It is an
extension of STECMAP (astro-ph/0505209) to the general case where the velocity
distribution of the underlying stars is also unknown.
  %and can be used as is for the analysis of large sets of data. The
reconstructions of the stellar age distribution, the age-metallicity relation,
and the Line-Of-Sight Velocity Distribution (LOSVD) are all non-parametric,
i.e. no specific shape is assumed. The only a propri we use are positivity and
the requirement that the solution is smooth enough. The smoothness parameter
can be set by GCV according to the level of noise in the data in order to avoid
overinterpretation. We use single stellar populations (SSP) from PEGASE-HR
(R=10000, lambda lambda = 4000-6800 Angstrom, Le Borgne et al. 2004) to test
the method through realistic simulations. Non-Gaussianities in LOSVDs are
reliably recovered with SNR as low as 20 per 0.2 Angstrom pixel. It turns out
that the recovery of the stellar content is not degraded by the simultaneous
recovery of the kinematic distribution, so that the resolution in age and error
estimates given in Ocvirk et al. 2005 remain appropriate when used with
STECKMAP. We also explore the case of age-dependent kinematics (i.e. when each
stellar component has its own LOSVD). We separate the bulge and disk components
of an idealized simplified spiral galaxy in integrated light from high quality
pseudo data (SNR=100 per pixel, R=10000), and constrain the kinematics (mean
projected velocity, projected velocity dispersion) and age of both components.",2005-06-30T20:37:18Z
"Kelvin Helmholtz Instability and Circulation Transfer at an
  Isotropic-Anisotropic Superfluid Interface in a Neutron Star","A recent laboratory experiment (Blaauwgeers et al. 2003) suggests that a
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability at the interface between two superfluids, one
rotating and anisotropic, the other stationary and isotropic, may trigger
sudden spin-up of the stationary superfluid. This result suggests that a KH
instability at the crust-core ($^1S_0$-$^3P_2$-superfluid) boundary of a
neutron star may provide a trigger mechanism for pulsar glitches. We calculate
the dispersion relation of the KH instability involving two different
superfluids including the normal fluid components and their effects on
stability, particularly entropy transport. We show that an entropy difference
between the core and crust superfluids reduces the threshold differential shear
velocity and threshold crust-core density ratio. We evaluate the wavelength of
maximum growth of the instability for neutron star parameters and find the
resultant circulation transfer to be within the range observed in pulsar
glitches.",2005-05-26T10:02:01Z
The faint-end of the galaxy luminosity function in groups,"We compute the galaxy luminosity function in spectroscopically selected
nearby groups and clusters. Our sample comprises 728 systems extracted from the
third release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the redshift range $0.03 < z <
0.06$ with virial mass range $10^{11}M_\odot < M_{vir} < 2\times
10^{14}M_\odot$. In order to compute the galaxy luminosity function, we apply a
statistical background subtraction method following usually adopted techniques.
In the $r$ band, the composite galaxy luminosity function shows a slope
$\alpha=-1.3$ in the bright--end, and an upturn of the slope in the faint--end,
$M_r\ga -18+5log(h)$, to slopes $-1.9<\alpha<-1.6$. We find that this feature
is present also in the $i,g$ and $z$ bands, and for all explored group
subsamples, irrespective of the group mass, number of members, integrated color
or the presence of a hot intra-cluster gas associated to X-ray emission.",2005-07-06T18:11:32Z
The ASTRO-F Mission : Large Area Infrared Survey,"ASTRO-F is the first Japanese satellite mission dedicated for large area
surveys in the infrared. The 69cm aperture telescope and scientific instruments
are cooled to 6K by liquid Helium and mechanical coolers. During the expected
mission life of more than 500 days, ASTRO-F will make the most advanced all-sky
survey in the mid- to far-infrared since the Infrared astronomical Satellite
(IRAS). The survey will be made in 6 wavebands and will include the first all
sky survey at >100-160(mu)m. Deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys with
pointed observations will also be carried out in 13 wavelength bands from
2-160(mu)m. ASTRO-F should detect more than a half million galaxies tracing the
large-scale structure of the Universe out to redshifts of unity, detecting
rare, exotic extraordinarily luminous objects at high redshift, numerous brown
dwarfs, Vega-like stars, protostars, and will reveal the large-scale structure
of nearby galactic star forming regions. ASTRO-F is a perfect complement to
Spitzer Space Telescope in respect of its wide sky and wavelength coverage.

"RR Lyrae search and stellar populations study in Canis Major:
  Preliminary Results","We present preliminary results of a RR Lyrae star search and stellar
populations study performed in the Canis Major overdensity, spanning an area of
8.35sq deg. The observations were made in R and V bands, with the QUEST camera
installed in the 1m Jurgen Stock Telescope, at the Venezuela National
Observatory. The resulting Hess diagram shows a possible, but weak, red giant
branch and no obvious horizontal branch, red clump or main sequence turnoff.
After a multi--epoch photometric search, 6 RR Lyrae stars were confirmed with
further observations obtained at the 1.0 and 1.3m telescopes of the SMARTS

Magneto-rotational overstability in accretion disks,"We present analytical and numerical studies of magnetorotational
instabilities occuring in magnetized accretion disks. In these studies we make
use of the linearised compressible MHD equations. These calculations are
performed for general radially stratified disks in the cylindrical limit. In
particular, we investigate the influence of nonvanishing toroidal magnetic
field component on the growth rate and oscillation frequency of
magnetorotational instabilities in Keplerian disks. We find the persistence of
these instabilities in accretion disks close to equipartition. Our calculations
show that these eigenmodes become overstable (complex eigenvalue), due to the
presence of a toroidal magnetic field component, while their growth rate
reduces slightly. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of
magneto-rotational overstabilities in weakly magnetized sub-Keplerian rotating
disks. We show that the growth rate scales with the rotation frequency of the
disk. These eigenmodes also have a nonzero oscillation frequency, due to the
presence of the dominant toroidal magnetic field component. The overstable
character of the MRI increases as the rotation frequency of the disk decreases.",2005-04-18T10:11:29Z

spectroscopic indices and the metallicity of open cluster giants. We use \chi^2
analysis to fit the relation of spectrophotometric indices to metallicity in
field giants. The resulting function allows an estimate of the target-cluster
giants' metallicities with an error in the method of \pm0.08 dex. We derive the
following metallicities for the seven open clusters: NGC 1245,
[m/H]=-0.14\pm0.04; NGC 2099, [m/H]=+0.05\pm0.05; NGC 2324, [m/H]=-0.06\pm0.04;
NGC 2539, [m/H]=-0.04\pm0.03; NGC 2682 (M67), [m/H]=-0.05\pm0.02; NGC 6705,
[m/H]=+0.14\pm0.08; NGC 6819, [m/H]=-0.07\pm0.12. These metallicity estimates
will be useful in planning future extra-solar planet transit searches since
planets may form more readily in metal-rich environments.",2005-06-29T20:00:31Z
"Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Flows (MDAFs) and Jet Production in the
  Low/Hard STate","In this paper I propose that the inner part of a black hole accretion inflow
($< 100 r_{g}$) may enter a magnetically-dominated, magnetosphere-like phase in
which the strong, well-ordered fields play a more important role than weak,
turbulent fields. In the low/hard state this flow is interior to the standard
ADAF usually invoked to explain the observed hot, optically thin emission.
Preliminary solutions for these new MDAFs are presented.
  Time-dependent X-ray and radio observations give considerable insight into
these processes, and a new interpretation of the X-ray power spectrum (as
arising from many disk radii) may be in order. While an evaporative ADAF model
explains the noise power above 0.01 Hz, an inner MDAF is needed to explain the
high frequency cutoff near 1 Hz, the presence of a QPO, and the production of a
jet. The MDAF scenario also is consistent with the data-based, phemonenological
models presented at this meeting by several authors.",2005-04-22T21:39:12Z
"Detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background using pulsar
  timing","The direct detection of gravitational waves is a major goal of current
astrophysics. We provide details of a new method for detecting a stochastic
background of gravitational waves using pulsar timing data. Our results show
that regular timing observations of 40 pulsars each with a timing accuracy of
100 nano-seconds will be able to make a direct detection of the predicted
stochastic background from coalescing black holes within five years. With an
improved pre-whitening algorithm, or if the background is at the upper end of
the predicted range, a significant detection should be possible with only 20
pulsars.",2005-04-21T05:49:46Z
A variability study of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6300 with XMM-Newton,"We present the results of timing analysis of the XMM-Newton observation of
the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6300. The hard X-ray spectrum above 2 keV consists of
a Compton-thin-absorbed power law, as is often seen in Seyfert 2 galaxies. We
clearly detected rapid time variability on a time scale of about 1000 s from
the light curve above 2 keV. The excess variance of the time variability
(sigma2_RMS) is calculated to be ~0.12, and the periodogram of the light curve
is well represented by a power law function with a slope of 1.75. In contrast
with previous results from Seyfert 2 nuclei, these variability characteristics
are consistent with those of Seyfert 1 galaxies. This consistency suggests that
NGC 6300 has a similar black hole mass and accretion properties as Seyfert 1
galaxies. Using the relation between time variability and central black hole
mass by Hayashida et al. (1998), the black hole mass of NGC 6300 is estimated
to be ~2.8x10^5 Mo. Taking uncertainty of this method into account, the black
hole mass is less than 10^7 Mo. Taking the bolometric luminosity of 3.3x10^43
erg/s into consideration, this yields an accretion rate of > 0.03 of the
Eddington value, and comparable with estimates from Seyfert 1 galaxies using
this method. The time variability analysis suggests that NGC 6300 actually has
a Seyfert 1 nucleus obscured by a thick matter, and more generally provides a
new pillar of support for the unified model of Seyfert galaxies based on
obscuration.",2005-07-20T07:12:31Z
"An improved formula for the relativistic corrections to the kinematical
  Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect for clusters of galaxies","We improve the calculation of Nozawa, Itoh, and Kohyama (1998) to provide a
formula for relativistic corrections to the thermal and kinematical
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects that is accurate to fourth order in theta_e =
kT_e/m_ec^2, T_e and m_e being the electron temperature and electron mass,
respectively. We also carry out a direct numerical integration of the Boltzmann
collision term and confirm the excellent accuracy of the analytic formula. This
formula will be useful for the analysis of the observational data of the
forthcoming experiments of the kinematical Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect for
clusters of galaxies.",2005-07-20T05:49:29Z
On the detection of chemically peculiar stars using Delta a photometry,"We have summarized all Delta a measurements for galactic field stars (1474
objects) from the literature published over more than two decades. These
measurements were, for the first time, compiled and homogeneously analyzed. The
Delta a intermediate band photometric system samples the depth of the 520nm
flux depression by comparing the flux at the center with the adjacent regions
with bandwidths of 11 to 23nm. Because it was slightly modified over the last
three decades, we checked for systematic trends for the different measurements
but found no correlations whatsoever. The Delta a photometric system is most
suitable to detecting magnetic chemically peculiar (CP) stars with high
efficiency, but is also capable of detecting a small percentage of non-magnetic
CP objects. Furthermore, the groups of (metal-weak) lambda Bootis, as well as
classical Be/shell stars, can be successfully investigated. In addition, we
also analyzed the behaviour of supergiants (luminosity class I and II). On the
basis of apparent normal type objects, the correlation of the three sigma
significance limit and the percentage of positive detection for all groups was
derived. We compared the capability of the Delta a photometric system with the
Delta (V1 - G) and Z indices of the Geneva 7-color system to detect peculiar
objects. Both photometric systems show the same efficiency for the detection of
CP and lambda Bootis stars, while the indices in the Geneva system are even
more efficient at detecting Be/shell objects. On the basis of this statistical
analysis it is possible to derive the incidence of CP stars in galactic open
cluster and extragalactic systems including the former unknown bias of
undetected objects.",2005-07-06T09:43:36Z
"On the theory of MHD waves in a shear flow of a magnetized turbulent
  plasma","The set of equations for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in a shear flow is
consecutively derived. The proposed scenario involves the presence of a
self-sustained turbulence and magnetic field. In the framework of
Langevin--Burgers approach the influence of the turbulence is described by an
additional external random force in the MHD system. Kinetic equation for the
spectral density of the slow magnetosonic (Alfvenic) mode is derived in the
short wavelength (WKB) approximation. The results show a pressing need for
conduction of numerical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a random driver to
take into account the influence of the long wavelength modes and to give a more
precise analytical assessment of the short ones. Realistic MC calculations for
the heating rate and shear stress tensor should give an answer to the
perplexing problem for the missing viscosity in accretion disks and reveal why
the quasars are the most powerful sources of light in the universe. The planned
MC calculations can be incorporated in global models for accretion disks and
also in all other physical conditions where there is a shear flow in a
magnetized turbulent plasma. It is supposed that the heating mechanism by
Alfven waves absorption is common for many kinds of space plasmas from solar
corona to active galactic nuclei and the solution of these longstanding puzzles
deserves active interdisciplinary research. The work is illustrated by
numerical calculations and by exact solutions for the time dependence of the
magnetic field given by the Heun function.",2005-07-29T12:10:48Z
Implications of the Curvaton on Inflationary Cosmology,"We study implications of the curvaton, a late-decaying light scalar field, on
inflationary cosmology, paying particular attentions to modifications of
observable quantities such as the scalar spectral index of the primordial power
spectrum and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider this issue from a general
viewpoint and discuss how the observable quantities are affected by the
existence of the curvaton. It is shown that the modification owing to the
curvaton depends on class of inflation models. We also study the effects of the
curvaton on inflation models generated by the inflationary flow equation.",2005-05-17T06:45:39Z
Rotating Quark Star in Chiral Colour Dielectric Model,"The properties of rotating quark star is studied using the equation of state
obtained from Chiral Colour Dielectric model. The results are compared with the
MIT bag model results. The frequencies in the corotating innermost circular
orbits for different central densities are evaluated and compared with the
observational results.",2005-06-09T13:32:21Z
Spectral Synthesis of SDSS Galaxies,"We investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a mean to estimate physical
properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the
decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of
simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities (here from Bruzual
& Charlot 2003), producing as output the star-formation and chemical histories
of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. We discuss the reliability
of this approach and apply it to a volume limited sample of 50362 galaxies from
the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalog of stellar population properties.
A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of
these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative
agreement, despite substantial differences in the method of analysis. The
confidence in the method is further strengthened by several empirical and
astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and
independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong
correlations between stellar and nebular metallicites, stellar and nebular
extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of Halpha and 4000 \AA
break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion. We also present
preliminary results of an analysis of a magnitude-limited sample which clearly
reveals that the bimodality of galaxy populations is present in the parameters
computed in the synthesis. Our results are also consistent with the
""down-sizing"" scenario of galaxy formation and evolution. Finally, we point out
one of the major problems facing spectral synthesis of early-type systems: the
spectral base adopted here is based on solar-scaled evolutionary tracks whose
abundance pattern may not be appropriate for this type of galaxy.",2005-06-17T16:59:06Z
Molecular Hydrogen in the Damped Ly alpha Absorber of Q1331+170,"We used HST/STIS to obtain the spectrum of molecular hydrogen associated with
the damped Ly$\alpha$ system at $z_{\rm abs}=1.7765$ toward the quasar
Q1331+170 at $z_{\rm em}=2.084$. Strong ${\rm H}_2$ absorption was detected,
with a total ${\rm H}_2$ column density of $N({\rm H}_2)=(4.45\pm 0.36)\times
10^{19} {\rm cm^{-2}}$.The molecular hydrogen fraction is $f_{{\rm
H}_2}=\frac{2N_{\rm H_2}}{N_{\rm HI}+2N_{\rm H_2}}=(5.6\pm 0.7)%$, which is the
greatest value reported so far in any redshifted damped Ly$\alpha$ system. This
results from the combined effect of a relatively high dust-to-gas ratio, a low
gas temperature, and an extremely low ambient UV radiation field. Based on the
observed population of $J$ states, we estimate the photo-absorption rate to be
$R_{\rm abs}=(7.6\pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13} {\rm s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a
local UV radiation field of $J(1000{\rm \AA})\approx 2.1\times 10^{-3}
J_{1000{\rm \AA},\odot}$, where $J_{1000{\rm \AA},\odot}$ is the UV intensity
at $1000 \AA$ in the solar neighborhood. This is comparable with the
metagalactic UV background intensity at this redshift, and implies an extremely
low star formation rate in the absorber's environment. The observed CO-to-H$_2$
column density ratio is $\frac{N_{\rm CO}}{N_{\rm H_2}}<2.5\times 10^{-7}$,
which is similar to the value measured for diffuse molecular clouds in the
Galactic ISM. Finally, applying the inferred physical conditions to the
observed C I fine structure excitation (Songaila {\it et al.} 1994), we
estimate the cosmic microwave background temperature to be $T_{\rm CMB}=(7.2\pm
0.8) {\rm K}$ at $z=1.77654$, consistent with the predicted value of $7.566
{\rm K}$ from the standard cosmology.",2005-06-30T18:02:39Z
"2D stationary resistive MHD flows: borderline to magnetic reconnection
  solutions","We present the basic equations for stationary, incompressible resistive MHD
flows in two dimensions. This leads to a system of differential equations for
two flux functions, one elliptic partial differential equation
(Grad-Shafranov-like) for the magnetic flux function and one for the stream
function of the flow. In these equations two potentials appear: one potential
is a generalized pressure. The second potential couples the magnetic and the
flow shear components of the system. With the restriction to flux or at least
line conserving flows one has to solve a modified Ohm's law. For the two
dimensional case these are two coupled differential equations, which represent
the borderline between the resistive but flux conserving (or line conserving)
case, and that of reconnective solutions. We discuss some simplified solutions
of these equations.",2005-05-27T14:00:38Z
"Particle-In-Cell Simulations of a Nonlinear Transverse Electromagnetic
  Wave in a Pulsar Wind Termination Shock","A 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell code is used to investigate the
propagation of a large-amplitude, superluminal, nearly transverse
electromagnetic (TEM) wave in a relativistically streaming electron-positron
plasma with and without a shock. In the freestreaming, unshocked case, the
analytic TEM dispersion relation is verified, and the streaming is shown to
stabilize the wave against parametric instabilities. In the confined, shocked
case, the wave induces strong, coherent particle oscillations, heats the
plasma, and modifies the shock density profile via ponderomotive effects. The
wave decays over $\gtrsim 10^2$ skin depths; the decay length scale depends
primarily on the ratio between the wave frequency and the effective plasma
frequency, and on the wave amplitude. The results are applied to the
termination shock of the Crab pulsar wind, where the decay length-scale (at
least 0.05"") might be comparable to the thickness of filamentary, variable
substructure observed in the optical and X-ray wisps and knots.",2005-08-08T14:00:27Z
Massive Star Outflows,"Molecular outflows in the form of wide-angle winds and/or well-collimated
jets are associated with young stellar objects of all luminosities. Independent
studies have established that the mass outflow rate is proportional to
L_bol^0.6 for L_bol = 0.3 to 10^5 L_sun, suggesting that there is a strong link
between accretion and outflow for a wide range of source luminosity and there
is reasonable evidence that accretion-related processes are responsible for
generating massive molecular flows from protostars up to spectral type B0.
Beyond L_bol ~ 10^4 L_sun, O stars generate powerful wide-angle, ionized winds
that can dramatically affect outflow morphology and even call into question the
relationship between outflow and accretion.
  Recently Beuther & Shepherd (2005) proposed an evolutionary scenario in which
massive protostellar flows (up to early B spectral type) begin collimated. Once
the star reaches the Main Sequence, ionizing radiation may affect the balance
between magnetic and plasma pressure, inducing changes in the flow morphology
and energetics. Here I review the properties of outflows from young OB stars,
discuss implications and observational tests of this proposed evolutionary
scenario, and examine differences between low-mass and massive star formation.",2005-06-01T18:11:12Z
Updated Colors for Cool Stars in the SDSS,"We present updated colors for M and L dwarfs based on photometry from the
third data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These data are
improved in quality and number from earlier results. We also provide updated
equations for determining photometric parallaxes from SDSS colors of late-type
stars. Walkowicz, Hawley & West (2004) have recently presented new techniques
for studying the magnetic activity of low-mass stars and their method relies on
an accurate determination of SDSS color. We derive new relationships between
SDSS colors and other common passbands and present updated formulas from
Walkowicz et al. (2004) for determining the level of magnetic activity in M and
L dwarfs.",2005-04-29T20:00:02Z
Modelling the chromosphere and transition region of Epsilon Eri (K2 V),"Measurements of ultraviolet line fluxes from Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph and Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer spectra of the K2-dwarf
Epsilon Eri are reported. These are used to develop new emission measure
distributions and semi-empirical atmospheric models for the chromosphere and
lower transition region of the star. These models are the most detailed
constructed to date for a main-sequence star other than the Sun. New ionisation
balance calculations, which account for the effect of finite density on
dielectronic recombination rates, are presented for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen
and silicon. The results of these calculations are significantly different from
the standard Arnaud & Rothenflug ion balance, particularly for alkali-like
ions. The new atmospheric models are used to place constraints on possible
First Ionisation Potential (FIP) related abundance variations in the lower
atmosphere and to discuss limitations of single-component models for the
interpretation of certain optically thick line fluxes.",2005-06-02T15:32:03Z
"An Analytic Model for the Axis-Ratio Distribution of Dark Matter Halos
  from the Primordial Gaussian Density Field","We present an analytic expression for the axis ratio distribution of triaxial
dark matter halos driven from physical principles. Adopting the picture of
triaxial collapse based on the Zel'dovich approximation, we derive analytically
both the minor-to-major and the conditional intermediate-to-major axis ratio
distributions, and examine how they depend on the halo mass, redshift, and
cosmology. Our analytic model is tested against the simulation data given by
Jing & Suto in 2002, and found to reproduce the conditional
intermediate-to-major axis ratio distribution successfully and the
minor-to-major axis ratio distribution approximately. However, the trends of
our analytic axis-ratio distributions with mass and redshift are opposite to
what is found in N-body simulations. This failure of our analytic model puts a
limitation on analytic approaches based on the Lagrangian theory to the halo
ellipticity. Given the overall agreement with the simulation results, our model
provides a new theoretical step toward using the axis-ratio distribution of
dark halos as a cosmological probe. We also discuss several possibilities to
improve the model.",2005-04-28T07:50:50Z
Massive Coronae of Galaxies,"There is reason to suspect that about half of the baryons are in
pressure-supported plasma in the halos of normal galaxies, drawn in by gravity
along with about half of the dark matter. To be consistent with the
observations this baryonic component, the corona, would have to be hotter than
the kinetic temperature of the dark matter in the halo so as to produce
acceptable central electron densities. We ascribe this hotter plasma
temperature to the addition of entropy prior to and during assembly of the
system, in an analogy to cluster formation. The plasma cooling time would be
longer than the gravitational collapse time but, in the inner parts, shorter
than the Hubble time, making the corona thermally unstable to the formation of
a cloudy structure that may be in line with what is indicated by quasar
absorption line systems. The corona of an isolated spiral galaxy would be a
source of soft X-ray and recombination radiation, adding to the more commonly
discussed effects of stars and supernovae. In this picture the mass in the
corona is much larger than the mass in condensed baryons in a spiral galaxy.
The corona thus would be a substantial reservoir of diffuse baryons that are
settling and adding to the mass in interstellar matter and stars, so that star
formation in isolated spirals will continue well beyond the present epoch.",2005-08-01T17:47:55Z
A new intermediate mass protostar in the Cepheus A HW2 region,"We present the discovery of the first molecular hot core associated with an
intermediate mass protostar in the CepA HW2 region. The hot condensation was
detected from single dish and interferometric observations of several high
excitation rotational lines (from 100 to 880K above the ground state) of SO2 in
the ground vibrational state and of HC3N in the vibrationally excited states
v7=1 and v7=2. The kinetic temperature derived from both molecules is 160K. The
high-angular resolution observations (1.25'' x 0.99'') of the SO2
J=28(7,21)-29(6,24) line (488K above the ground state) show that the hot gas is
concentrated in a compact condensation with a size of 0.6''(430AU), located
0.4'' (300AU) east from the radio-jet HW2. The total SO2 column density in the
hot condensation is 10E18cm-2, with a H2 column density ranging from 10E23 to 6
x 10E24cm-2. The H2 density and the SO2 fractional abundance must be larger
than 10E7cm-3 and 2 x 10E-7 respectively. The most likely alternatives for the
nature of the hot and very dense condensation are discussed. From the large
column densities of hot gas, the detection of the HC3N vibrationally excited
lines and the large SO2 abundance, we favor the interpretation of a hot core
heated by an intermediate mass protostar of 10E3 Lo. This indicates that the
CepA HW2 region contains a cluster of very young stars.",2005-06-22T11:04:29Z
"Evidence for a fundamental stellar upper mass limit from clustered star
  formation, and some implications therof","Theoretical considerations lead to the expectation that stars should not have
masses larger than about m_{max*}=60-120Msun, while the observational evidence
has been ambiguous. Only very recently has a physical stellar mass limit near
150Msun emerged thanks to modern high-resolution observations of local
star-burst clusters. But this limit does not appear to depend on metallicity,
in contradiction to theory. Important uncertainties remain though. It is now
also emerging that star-clusters limit the masses of their constituent stars,
such that a well-defined relation between the mass of the most massive star in
a cluster and the cluster mass, m_{max}=F(M_ecl) \le m_{max*}\approx 150Msun,
exists. One rather startling finding is that the observational data strongly
favour clusters being built-up by consecutively forming more-massive stars
until the most massive stars terminate further star-formation. The relation
also implies that composite populations, which consist of many star clusters,
most of which may be dissolved, must have steeper composite IMFs than simple
stellar populations such as are found in individual clusters. Thus, for
example, 10^5 Taurus--Auriga star-forming groups, each with 20 stars, will ever
only sample the IMF below about 1Msun. This IMF will therefore not be identical
to the IMF of one cluster with 2 times 10^6 stars. The implication is that the
star-formation history of a galaxy critically determines its integrated
galaxial IMF and thus the total number of supernovae per star and its chemical
enrichment history. Galaxy formation and evolution models that rely on an
invariant IMF would be wrong.",2005-07-25T20:05:50Z
Galaxy Rotation Curves Without Non-Baryonic Dark Matter,"We apply the modified acceleration law obtained from Einstein gravity coupled
explaining galaxy rotation curves without exotic dark matter. Our sample of
galaxies includes low surface brightness (LSB) and high surface brightness
(HSB) galaxies, and an elliptical galaxy. In those cases where photometric data
are available, a best fit via the single parameter (M/L)_{stars} to the
luminosity of the gaseous (HI plus He) and luminous stellar disks is obtained.
Additionally, a best fit to the rotation curves of galaxies is obtained in
terms of a parametric mass distribution (independent of luminosity
observations) -- a two parameter fit to the total galactic mass, (or
mass-to-light ratio M/L), and a core radius associated with a model of the
galaxy cores using a nonlinear least-squares fitting routine including
estimated errors. The fits are compared to those obtained using Milgrom's
phenomenological MOND model and to the predictions of the Newtonian-Kepler
acceleration law.",2005-06-16T13:32:01Z
B-Inflation,"We propose a novel model of inflation based on a large class of covariant
effective actions containing only the second derivatives of a scalar field. The
initial conditions leading to the inflationary solutions in this model are
rather generic. The graceful exit from the inflationary regime is natural once
the first order derivative terms are included.",2005-04-25T22:51:08Z
Discovery of Oxygen Kalpha X-ray Emission from the Rings of Saturn,"Using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), the Chandra X-ray
Observatory (CXO) observed the Saturnian system for one rotation of the planet
(~37 ks) on 20 January, 2004, and again on 26-27 January, 2004. In this letter
we report the detection of X-ray emission from the rings of Saturn. The X-ray
spectrum from the rings is dominated by emission in a narrow (~130 eV wide)
energy band centered on the atomic oxygen K-alpha fluorescence line at 0.53
keV. The X-ray power emitted from the rings in the 0.49-0.62 keV band is 84 MW,
which is about one-third of that emitted from Saturn disk in the photon energy
range 0.24-2.0 keV. Our analysis also finds a clear detection of X-ray emission
from the rings in the 0.49-0.62 keV band in an earlier (14-15 April, 2003)
Chandra ACIS observation of Saturn. Fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays from
oxygen atoms in the H2O icy ring material is the likely source mechanism for
ring X-rays, consistent with the scenario of solar photo-production of a
tenuous ring oxygen atmosphere and ionosphere recently discovered by Cassini.",2005-05-19T14:13:24Z
"Outflows in Infrared-Luminous Starbursts at z < 0.5. II. Analysis and
  Discussion","We have performed an absorption-line survey of outflowing gas in 78
starburst-dominated, infrared-luminous galaxies. This is the largest study of
superwinds at z < 3. Superwinds are found in almost all infrared-luminous
galaxies, and changes in detection rate with SFR--winds are found twice as
often in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) as in less-luminous
galaxies--reflect different wind geometries. The maximum velocities we measure
are 600 km/s, though most of the outflowing gas has lower velocities (100-200
km/s). (One galaxy has velocities exceeding 1000 km/s.) Velocities in LINERs
are higher than in HII galaxies, and outflowing ionized gas often has higher
velocities than the neutral gas. Wind properties (velocity, mass, momentum, and
energy) scale with galaxy properties (SFR, luminosity, and galaxy mass),
consistent with ram-pressure driving of the wind. Wind properties increase
strongly with increasing galactic mass, contrary to expectation. These
correlations flatten at high SFR (> 10-100 M_sun/yr), luminosities, and masses.
This saturation is due to a lack of gas remaining in the wind's path, a common
neutral gas terminal velocity, and/or a decrease in the efficiency of
thermalization of the supernovae energy. It means that mass entrainment
efficiency, rather than remaining constant, declines in galaxies with SFR > 10
M_sun/yr and M_K < -24. Half of our sample consists of ULIRGs, which host as
much as half of the star formation in the universe at z > 1. The powerful,
ubiquitous winds we observe in these galaxies imply that superwinds in massive
galaxies at redshifts above unity play an important role in the evolution of
galaxies and the intergalactic medium.",2005-06-24T20:28:46Z
"The Evolution of Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers: Metallicities and Star
  Formation Rates","The damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA quasar absorption lines provide
powerful probes of the evolution of metals, gas, and stars in galaxies. One
major obstacle in trying to understand the evolution of DLAs and sub-DLAs has
been the small number of metallicity measurements at z < 1.5, an epoch spanning
\~70 % of the cosmic history. In recent surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope
and Multiple Mirror Telescope, we have doubled the DLA Zn sample at z < 1.5.
Combining our results with those at higher redshifts from the literature, we
find that the global mean metallicity of DLAs does not rise to the solar value
at low redshifts. These surprising results appear to contradict the near-solar
mean metallicity observed for nearby (z ~ 0) galaxies and the predictions of
cosmic chemical evolution models based on the global star formation history.
Finally, we discuss direct constraints on the star formation rates (SFRs) in
the absorber galaxies from our deep Fabry-Perot Ly-alpha imaging study and
other emission-line studies in the literature. A large fraction of the observed
heavy-element quasar absorbers at 0 < z < 3.4 appear to have SFRs substantially
below the global mean SFR, consistent with the low metallicities observed in
the spectroscopic studies.",2005-04-26T05:46:47Z
"Search for Cross-Correlations of Ultra--High-Energy Cosmic Rays with BL
  Lacertae Objects","Data taken in stereo mode by the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) air
fluorescence experiment are analyzed to search for correlations between the
arrival directions of ultra--high-energy cosmic rays with the positions of BL
Lacertae objects. Several previous claims of significant correlations between
BL Lacs and cosmic rays observed by other experiments are tested. These claims
are not supported by the HiRes data. However, we verify a recent analysis of
correlations between HiRes events and a subset of confirmed BL Lacs from the
10th Veron Catalog, and we study this correlation in detail. Due to the a
posteriori nature of the search, the significance level cannot be reliably
estimated and the correlation must be tested independently before any claim can
be made. We identify the precise hypotheses that will be tested with
statistically independent data.",2005-07-06T04:22:51Z
"Seismic analysis of the second ionization region of helium in the Sun:
  I. Sensitivity study and methodology","The region of the second ionization of helium in the Sun is a narrow layer
near the surface. Ionization induces a local change of the adiabatic exponent
$\Gamma_1$, which produces a characteristic signature in the frequencies of
p-modes. By adapting the method developed by (Monteiro et al. 1994), we propose
a methodology for determining the properties of this region by studying such a
signature in the frequencies of oscillation.
  Using solar data we illustrate how the signal from the helium ionization zone
can be isolated. Using solar models with different physics -- theory of
convection, equation of state and low temperature opacities -- we establish how
the characteristics of the signal depend on the different aspects contributing
to the structure in the ionization layer. We further discuss how the method can
be used to measure the solar helium abundance in the envelope and to constrain
the physics affecting this region of the Sun.
  The potential usefulness of the method we propose is shown. It may complement
other inversion methods developed to study the solar structure and to determine
the envelope helium abundance.",2005-06-13T18:41:28Z
"UHE nuclei propagation and the interpretation of the ankle in the
  cosmic-ray spectrum","We consider the stochastic propagation of high-energy protons and nuclei in
the cosmological microwave and infrared backgrounds, using revised photonuclear
cross-sections and following primary and secondary nuclei in the full 2D
nuclear chart. We confirm earlier results showing that the high-energy data can
be fit with a pure proton extragalactic cosmic ray (EGCR) component if the
source spectrum is \propto E^{-2.6}. In this case the ankle in the CR spectrum
may be interpreted as a pair-production dip associated with the propagation. We
show that when heavier nuclei are included in the source with a composition
similar to that of Galactic cosmic-rays (GCRs), the pair-production dip is not
present unless the proton fraction is higher than 85%. In the mixed composition
case, the ankle recovers the past interpretation as the transition from GCRs to
EGCRs and the highest energy data can be explained by a harder source spectrum
\propto E^{-2.2} - E^{-2.3}, reminiscent of relativistic shock acceleration
predictions, and in good agreement with the GCR data at low-energy and holistic
scenarios.",2005-05-27T19:33:55Z
Multiband Echo Tomography of Sco X-1,"We present preliminary results of a simultaneous X-ray/optical campaign of
the prototypical LMXB Sco X-1 at 1-10 Hz time resolution. Lightcurves of the
high excitation Bowen/HeII emission lines and a red continuum at lambda ~ 6000
Ang were obtained through narrow interference filters with ULTRACAM, and these
were cross-correlated with simultaneous RXTE X-ray lightcurves. We find
evidence for correlated variability, in particular when Sco X-1 enters the
Flaring Branch. The Bowen/HeII lightcurves lag the X-ray lightcurves with a
light travel time which is consistent with reprocessing in the companion star
while the continuum lightcurves have shorter delays consistent with
reprocessing in the accretion disc",2005-07-04T13:12:54Z
Alternatives to Dark Matter and Dark Energy,"We review the underpinnings of the standard Newton-Einstein theory of
gravity, and identify where it could possibly go wrong. In particular, we
discuss the logical independence from each other of the general covariance
principle, the equivalence principle and the Einstein equations, and discuss
how to constrain the matter energy-momentum tensor which serves as the source
of gravity. We identify the a priori assumption of the validity of standard
gravity on all distance scales as the root cause of the dark matter and dark
energy problems, and discuss how the freedom currently present in gravitational
theory can enable us to construct candidate alternatives to the standard theory
in which the dark matter and dark energy problems could then be resolved. We
identify three generic aspects of these alternate approaches: that it is a
universal acceleration scale which determines when a luminous Newtonian
expectation is to fail to fit data, that there is a global cosmological effect
on local galactic motions which can replace galactic dark matter, and that to
solve the cosmological constant problem it is not necessary to quench the
cosmological constant itself, but only the amount by which it gravitates.",2005-05-12T19:15:30Z
"Keck Deep Fields. I. Observations, Reductions, and the Selection of
  Faint Star-Forming Galaxies at Redshifts z~4, 3, and 2","We introduce a very deep, R_lim~27, multicolor imaging survey of very faint
star-forming galaxies at z~4, z~3, z~2.2, and z~1.7. This survey, carried out
on the Keck I telescope, uses the very same UGRI filter system that is employed
by the Steidel team to select galaxies at these redshifts, and thus allows us
to construct identically-selected, but much fainter, samples. However, our
survey reaches ~1.5 mag deeper than the work of Steidel and his group, letting
us probe substantially below the characteristic luminosity L* and thus study
the properties and redshift evolution of the faint component of the high-z
galaxy population. The survey covers 169 square arcminutes in three spatially
independent patches on the sky and -- to R<~27 -- contains 427 GRI-selected z~4
LBGs, 1481 UGR-selected z~3 LBGs, 2417 UGR-selected z~2.2 star-forming
galaxies, and 2043 UGR-selected z~1.7 star-forming galaxies. In this paper, the
first in a series, we introduce the survey, describe our observing and data
reduction strategies, and outline the selection of our z~4, z~3, z~2.2, and
z~1.7 samples.",2005-07-19T17:27:38Z
"The distribution and kinematics of early high-sigma peaks in present-day
  haloes: implications for rare objects and old stellar populations","We show that the hierarchical assembly of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes
preserves the memory of the initial conditions. Using N-body cosmological
simulations, we demonstrate that the present-day spatial distribution and
kinematics of objects that formed within early (z > 10) protogalactic systems
(old stars, satellite galaxies, globular clusters, massive black holes, etc.)
depends mostly on the rarity of the peak of the primordial density field which
they originally belonged to. Only for objects forming at lower redshifts the
exact formation site within the progenitor halo (e.g. whether near the center
or in an extended disk) becomes important. In present-day haloes, material from
the rarer early peaks is more centrally concentrated and falls off more steeply
with radius compared to the overall mass distribution, it has a lower velocity
dispersion, moves on more radial orbits, and has a more elongated shape.
Population II stars that formed within protogalactic haloes collapsing from
>2.5 sigma fluctuations would follow today a r^{-3.5} density profile with a
half-light radius of 17 kpc and a velocity anisotropy that increases from
isotropic in the inner regions to nearly radial at the halo edge. This agrees
well with the radial velocity dispersion profile of Galaxy halo stars from
Battaglia et al. (2005) and with the anisotropic orbits of nearby halo stars.",2005-06-25T00:18:24Z
"Comments on ""Angular Momentum Transport in Quasi-Keplerian Accretion
  Disks""","Subramanian, Pujari and Becker (2004) claim that the correct expression for
the angular momentum transport in an accretion disc, which is proportional to
dOmega/dR, can be derived on the basis of the analysis of the epicyclic motion
of gas parcels in adjacent eddies in the disc. We study their argument and show
that their derivation contains several fundamental errors: 1) the biased choice
of the desired formula from an infinite number of formulae; 2) the biased
choice of parcel trajectories; and 3) confusion regarding the reference frames.
Following 1) we could derive, for example, a (invalid) formula in which the
angular momentum transport is proportional to dv_phi/dR, and from 2) we could
even prove that the angular momentum transport is either inward or null. We
present the correct approach to the problem of angular momentum transport in an
accretion disc in terms of mean free path theory.",2005-05-23T04:03:33Z
Simulating Gaia performances on white dwarfs,"One of the most promising space missions of ESA is the astrometric satellite
Gaia, which will provide very precise astrometry and multicolour photometry,
for all 1.3 billion objects to V~20, and radial velocities with accuracies of a
few km/s for most stars brighter than V ~ 17. Consequently, full homogeneous
six-dimensional phase-space information for a huge number of stars will become
available. Our Monte Carlo simulator has been used to estimate the number of
white dwarfs potentially observable by Gaia. From this we assess which would be
the white dwarf luminosity functions which Gaia will obtain and discuss in
depth the scientific returns of Gaia in the specific field of white dwarf
populations. Scientific attainable goals include, among others, a reliable
determination of the age of the Galactic disk, a better knowledge of the halo
of the Milky Way and the reconstruction of the star formation history of the
Galactic disk. Our results also demonstrate the potential impact of a mission
like Gaia in the current understanding of the white dwarf cooling theory.",2005-04-19T12:02:41Z
"Laboratory simulation of cometary x rays using a high-resolution
  microcalorimeter","X-ray emission following charge exchange has been studied on the University
of California Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory electron beam ion traps
EBIT-I and EBIT-II using a high-resolution microcalorimeter. The measured
spectra include the K-shell emission from hydrogenlike and heliumlike C, N, O,
and Ne needed for simulations of cometary x-ray emission. A comparison of the
spectra produced in the interaction of O8+ with N2 and CH4 is presented that
illustrates the dependence of the observed spectrum on the interaction gas.",2005-06-13T03:58:35Z
A Medium Resolution Near-Infrared Spectral Atlas of O and Early B Stars,"We present intermediate resolution (R ~ 8,000 - 12,000) high signal-to-noise
H- and K-band spectroscopy of a sample of 37 optically visible stars, ranging
in spectral type from O3 to B3 and representing most luminosity classes.
Spectra of this quality can be used to constrain the temperature, luminosity
and general wind properties of OB stars, when used in conjunction with
sophisticated atmospheric model codes. Most important is the need for
moderately high resolutions (R > 5000) and very high signal-to-noise (S/N >
150) spectra for a meaningful profile analysis. When using near-infrared
spectra for a classification system, moderately high signal-to-noise (S/N ~
100) is still required, though the resolution can be relaxed to just a thousand
or two. In the appendix we provide a set of very high quality near-infrared
spectra of Brackett lines in six early-A dwarfs. These can be used to aid in
the modeling and removal of such lines when early-A dwarfs are used for
telluric spectroscopic standards.",2005-06-28T20:42:27Z
Effect of Photometric Redshift Uncertainties on Weak Lensing Tomography,"We perform a systematic analysis of the effects of photometric redshift
uncertainties on weak lensing tomography. We describe the photo-z distribution
with a bias and Gaussian scatter that are allowed to vary arbitrarily between
intervals of dz = 0.1 in redshift.While the mere presence of bias and scatter
does not substantially degrade dark energy information, uncertainties in both
parameters do. For a fiducial next-generation survey each would need to be
known to better than about 0.003-0.01 in redshift for each interval in order to
lead to less than a factor of 1.5 increase in the dark energy parameter errors.
The more stringent requirement corresponds to a larger dark energy parameter
space, when redshift variation in the equation of state of dark energy is
allowed.Of order 10^4-10^5 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts fairly sampled
from the source galaxy distribution will be needed to achieve this level of
calibration. If the sample is composed of multiple galaxy types, a fair sample
would be required for each. These requirements increase in stringency for more
ambitious surveys; we quantify such scalings with a convenient fitting formula.
No single aspect of a photometrically binned selection of galaxies such as
their mean or median suffices, indicating that dark energy parameter
determinations are sensitive to the shape and nature of outliers in the photo-z
redshift distribution.",2005-06-24T21:52:09Z
The temperature structure in the core of Sersic 159-03,"We present results from a new 120 ks XMM-Newton observation of the cluster of
galaxies Sersic 159-03. In this paper we focus on the high-resolution X-ray
spectra obtained with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS). The spectra
allow us to constrain the temperature structure in the core of the cluster and
determine the emission measure distribution as a function of temperature. We
also fit the line widths of mainly oxygen and iron lines.",2005-04-12T07:53:53Z
Search for Aligned Events in Muon Groups Deep Underground,"A search for aligned events has been done throughout the muon group events
measured with Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope (BUST) during a long
period of time. Only groups of multiplicity >3 for muon threshold energies
equal to 0.25; 0.85; 2.0 and 3.2 TeV were selected for the analysis. A
distribution of the events on the alignment parameter /lambda has been obtained
and compared with the results of Monte-Carlo simulation made for this
experiment. Upper limit for aligned muon groups flux is given.",2005-07-01T10:56:12Z
"The metal abundance distribution of the oldest stellar component in the
  Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy","(abridged): Low resolution spectroscopy obtained with FORS2 at the Very Large
Telescope (VLT) has been used to measure individual metal abundances ([Fe/H])
for 107 RR Lyrae stars, and trace the metal distribution of the oldest stellar
component in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Their metallicities have an
average value of [Fe/H]=-1.83 +/- 0.03 (r.m.s. 0.26 dex) and cover the
metallicity range -2.40<[Fe/H]<-0.85 (only 1 star with [Fe/H]>-1). The
star-to-star scatter is larger than typical errors on individual metallicities
(+/- 0.15-0.16 dex), indicating a real spread in metal abundances. The radial
velocities have a dispersion of 12.9 km/s, consistent with the dispersion
derived in Sculptor by Tolstoy et al. (2004). This along with the metallicity
distribution, suggests that most of the RR Lyr's arise from the same burst of
stellar formation that produced the metal-poor component giving origin to the
galaxy blue horizontal branch, and only a few (if any) come from the centrally
concentrated metal-rich red horizontal branch population. The spectroscopic
metallicities and the apparent luminosities were used to study the
luminosity-metallicity relation, for which we derive a shallow slope of 0.09
mag/dex. This result can be due to a high level of evolution off the zero age
horizontal branch of the RR Lyrae stars in this galaxy, again in agreement with
their origin from the blue horizontal branch population.",2005-06-09T14:15:22Z
A non-main-sequence secondary in SY Cancri,"Simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations of the Z Cam type
dwarf nova SY Cancri were used to obtain absolute flux calibrations. A
comparison of the photometric calibration with a wide slit spectrophotometric
calibration showed that either method is equally satisfactory. A radial
velocity study of the secondary star, made using the far red NaI doublet,
yielded a mass ratio q = 0.68; this is very different from the value of 1.13
quoted in the literature. Using the new lower mass ratio, and constraining the
mass of the white dwarf to be within reasonable limits, then leads to a mass
for the secondary star that is substantially less than would be expected for
its orbital period if it satisfied a main-sequence mass-radius relationship. We
find a spectral type of M0 that is consistent with that expected for a
main-sequence star of the low mass we have found. However, in order to fill its
Roche lobe, the secondary must be significantly larger than a main sequence
star of that mass and spectral type. The secondary is definitely not a normal
main-sequence star.",2005-06-03T14:08:02Z
Bivariate Galaxy Luminosity Functions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"Bivariate luminosity functions (LFs) are computed for galaxies in the New
York Value-Added Galaxy Catalogue, based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release 4. The galaxy properties investigated are the morphological type,
inverse concentration index, Sersic index, absolute effective surface
brightness, reference frame colours, absolute radius, eClass spectral type,
stellar mass and galaxy environment. The morphological sample is flux-limited
to galaxies with r < 15.9 and consists of 37,047 classifications to an RMS
accuracy of +/- half a class in the sequence E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd, Im. These
were assigned by an artificial neural network, based on a training set of 645
eyeball classifications. The other samples use r < 17.77 with a median redshift
of z ~ 0.08, and a limiting redshift of z < 0.15 to minimize the effects of
evolution. Other cuts, for example in axis ratio, are made to minimize biases.
A wealth of detail is seen, with clear variations between the LFs according to
absolute magnitude and the second parameter. They are consistent with an early
type, bright, concentrated, red population and a late type, faint, less
concentrated, blue, star forming population. This bimodality suggests two major
underlying physical processes, which in agreement with previous authors we
hypothesize to be merger and accretion, associated with the properties of
bulges and discs respectively. The bivariate luminosity-surface brightness
distribution is fit with the Choloniewski function (a Schechter function in
absolute magnitude and Gaussian in surface brightness). The fit is found to be
poor, as might be expected if there are two underlying processes.",2005-07-22T19:58:39Z
The mass of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the missing satellite problem,"We present the results from a suite of N-body simulations of the tidal
stripping of two-component dwarf galaxies comprising some stars and dark
matter. We show that recent kinematic data from the local group dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies suggests that dSph galaxies must be sufficiently
massive ($10^9 - 10^{10}$M$_\odot$) that tidal stripping is of little
importance for the stars. We discuss the implications of these massive dSph
galaxies for cosmology and galaxy formation.",2005-05-11T10:55:30Z
"Theoretical Color-Magnitude Diagrams and the Star Forming Histories of
  Interacting Open Multi-population Model Galaxies: Bursts and Busts","This note presents theoretical color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and
metallicity evolution for Galactic multi-population models coupled to stellar
evolution models for systems undergoing stripping and re-accretion of ambient
material, called ``open'' systems in our recent studies (Valle, Galli, and
Shore, 2005, A&A, 435, 551). We show that the observables for such systems, in
particular those related to the recovered star formation as a function of time,
are ambiguous -- systems with non-monotonic star formation rates can appear as
either bursting systems or galaxies with a hiatus in the star formation.",2005-06-20T16:08:07Z
"Precision X-ray Timing of RX J0806.3+1527 with CHANDRA: Evidence for
  Gravitational Radiation from an Ultracompact Binary","RX J0806.3+1527 is a candidate double degenerate binary with possibly the
shortest known orbital period. The source shows an 100% X-ray intensity
modulation at the putative orbital frequency of 3.11 mHz (321.5 s). If the
system is a detached, ultracompact binary gravitational radiation should drive
spin-up with a magnitude of ~10-16 Hz/s. Here we describe the results of the
first phase coherent X-ray monitoring campaign on RX J0806.3+1527 with Chandra.
We obtained a total of 70 ksec of exposure in 6 epochs logarithmically spaced
over 320 days. These data conclusively show that the X-ray frequency is
increasing at a rate of 3.77 +- 0.8 x 10-16 Hz/s. Using our new ephemeris we
are able to phase up all the earlier Chandra and ROSAT data and show they are
consistent with a rate of 3.63 +- 0.06 x 10-16 Hz/s over the past decade. This
value appears consistent with that recently derived by Israel et al. largely
from monitoring of the optical modulation, and is in rough agreement with the
solutions reported initially by Hakala et al., based on ground-based optical
observations. The large spin-up is consistent with gravitational radiation
losses driving the evolution. An intermediate polar (IP) scenario where the
observed X-ray period is the spin period of an accreting white dwarf appears
less tenable. If the ultracompact scenario is correct, then the X-ray flux
cannot be powered by stable accretion which would drive the components apart,
suggesting a new type of energy source (perhaps electromagnetic) may power the
X-ray flux.",2005-04-06T13:42:08Z
"The Opacity of Spiral Galaxy Disks: dust opacity from calibrated counts
  of distant galaxies","The opacity of foreground spiral disks can be probed from the number of
distant galaxies seen through them. To calibrate this number for effects other
than the dust extinction, Gonzalez et al (1998) developed the ""Synthetic Field
Method"". A synthetic field is an extincted Hubble Deep Field added to the
science field. The relation between the dimming and the number of retrieved
synthetic galaxies calibrates the number found in the science field. Here I
present results from counts in 32 HST/WFPC2 fields. The relation between
opacity and radius, arm and disk, surface brightness and HI are presented. The
opacity is found to be caused by a clumpy distribution of clouds in the disk.
The brighter parts of the disk -the center and arms- are also the more opaque
ones. The dust distribution in spiral disks is found to be more extended than
the stellar disk. A comparison between HI column densities and opacity shows
little relation between the two.",2005-08-11T14:02:40Z
PPN-limit of Fourth Order Gravity inspired by Scalar-Tensor Gravity,"Based on the {\it dynamical} equivalence between higher order gravity and
scalar-tensor gravity the PPN-limit of fourth order gravity is discussed. We
exploit this analogy developing a fourth order gravity version of the Eddington
PPN-parameters. As a result, Solar System experiments can be reconciled with
higher order gravity, if physical constraints descending from experiments are
fulfilled.",2005-07-22T17:23:51Z
Numeric Spectrum of Relic Gravitational Waves in Accelerating Universe,"The accelerating expansion of the Universe at the present stage is a process
that will change the spectrum of relic gravitational waves. Here we present a
numerical calculation for the power spectrum of relic gravitational waves in
the accelerating Universe. The results show that although the overall features
of the power spectrum is similar to that in the non-accelerating models, the
amplitude is smaller by an order of $10^{-1}$. We also find that the spectrum
is very sensitive to the index $\beta$ of the inflationary expansion with the
scale factor $a(\tau) \propto |\tau|^{1+\beta}$. With increase of $\beta$, the
resulting spectrum is tilted to be flatter with more power on high frequencies,
and the sensitivity of the second science run of the LIGO detectors puts a
restriction on the parameter $\beta < -1.8$. The influence of reheating
following the inflation has been examined.",2005-05-30T05:03:33Z
Hard X-ray diffuse emission from the Galactic Center seen by INTEGRAL,"We study the hard X-ray (20-100 keV) variability of the Galactic Center (GC)
and of the nearby sources on the time scale of 1000 s. We find that 3 of the 6
hard X-ray sources detected by INTEGRAL within the central 1 degree of the
Galaxy are not variable on this time scale: the GC itself (the source IGR
J1745.6-2901) as well as the source 1E 1743.1-2843 and the molecular cloud Sgr
B2. We put an upper limit of 5 x 10^{-12} erg/(cm^2 sec) (in 20 to 60 keV band)
on the variable emission form the supermassive black hole (the source Sgr A*)
which powers the activity of the GC(although we can not exclude the possibility
of rare stronger flares). The non-variable 20-100 keV emission from the GC
turns out to be the high-energy non-thermal tail of the diffuse hard ``8 keV''
component of emission from Sgr A region. Combining the XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL
data we find that the size of the extended hard X-ray emission region is about
20 pc. The only physical mechanism of production of diffuse non-thermal hard
X-ray flux, which does not contradict the multi-wavelength data on the GC, is
the synchrotron emission from electrons of energies 10-100 TeV.",2005-06-18T12:22:02Z
"Iron abundances derived from RR Lyrae light curves and low-dispersion
  spectroscopy","With the aid of the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) database on the Galactic
field, we compare the iron abundances of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars
derived from the Fourier parameters with those obtained from low-dispersion
spectroscopy. We show from a set of 79 stars, distinct from the original
calibrating sample of the Fourier method and selected without quality control,
that almost all discrepant estimates are the results of some defects or
peculiarities either in the photometry or in the spectroscopy. Omitting objects
deviating by more than 0.4dex, the remaining subsample of 64 stars yields
Fourier abundances that fit the spectroscopic ones with a standard deviation of
0.20dex. Other, more stringent selection criteria and different Fourier
decompositions lead to smaller subsamples and concomitant better agreement,
down to 0.16dex standard deviation. Except perhaps for two variables among the
163 stars, comprised of the ASAS variables and those of the original
calibrating set of the Fourier method, all discrepant values can be accounted
for by observational noise and insufficient data coverage. We suggest that the
agreement can be further improved when new, more accurate spectroscopic data
become available for a test with the best photometric data. As a by-product of
this analysis, we also compute revised periods and select Blazhko variables.",2005-04-14T14:02:48Z
Discovery of a widely separated binary system of very low mass stars,"We report our discovery of a nearby wide binary system, LP 714-37 AB.
Phan-Bao et al. identified LP 714-37 as a mid-M dwarf during a
cross-identification of the NLTT and DENIS catalogues. Our CCD images resolve
the system into a binary with a projected angular separation of 1.8 arcsec, or
33 AU, and low-resolution optical spectra give spectral types of M5.5 (LP
714-37A) and M7.5 (LP 714-37B). This makes LP 714-37 AB one of very few widely
separated (separation > 30 AU) very low-mass binary systems known in the field,
and we discuss it in the context of the multiplicity properties of very
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.",2005-06-25T06:48:30Z
A Survey of Eclipsing Binary Stars in the Eastern Spiral Arm of M31,"Results of an archival survey are presented using B-band imaging of the
eastern spiral arm of M31. Focusing on the eclipsing binary star population, a
matched-filter technique has been used to identify 280 binary systems. Of
these, 127 systems (98 of which are newly discovered) have sufficient phase
coverage to allow accurate orbital periods to be determined. At least nine of
these binaries are detached systems which could, in principle, be used for
distance determination. The light curves of the detached and other selected
systems are presented along with a discussion of some of the more interesting
binaries. The impact of unresolved stellar blends on these lightcurves is
considered.",2005-06-23T19:50:41Z
Comparative Planetary Atmospheres: Models of TrES-1 and HD209458b,"We present new self-consistent atmosphere models for transiting planets
TrES-1 and HD209458b. The planets were recently observed with the Spitzer Space
Telescope in bands centered on 4.5 and 8.0 $\mu$m, for TrES-1, and 24 $\mu$m,
for HD209458b. We find that standard solar metallicity models fit the
observations for HD209458b. For TrES-1, which has an T_eff ~300 K cooler, we
find that models with a metallicity 3-5 times enhanced over solar abundances
can match the 1$\sigma$ error bar at 4.5 $\mu$m and 2$\sigma$ at 8.0$\mu$m.
Models with solar abundances that included energy deposition into the
stratosphere give fluxes that fall within the 2$\sigma$ error bars in both
bands. The best-fit models for both planets assume that reradiation of absorbed
stellar flux occurs over the entire planet. For all models of both planets we
predict planet/star flux ratios in other Spitzer bandpasses.",2005-05-17T20:13:27Z
Curvature driven acceleration : a utopia or a reality ?,"The present work shows that a combination of nonlinear contribution from the
Ricci curvature in Einstein field equations can drive a late time acceleration
of expansion of the universe. The transit from the decelerated to the
accelerated phase of expansion takes place smoothly without having to resort to
a study of asymptotic behaviour. This result emphasizes the need for thorough
and critical examination of models with nonlinear contribution from the
curvature.",2005-05-05T12:32:31Z
"The radial velocity dispersion profile of the Galactic halo:
  Constraining the density profile of the dark halo of the Milky Way","We have compiled a new sample of 240 halo objects with accurate distance and
radial velocity measurements, including globular clusters, satellite galaxies,
field blue horizontal branch stars and red giant stars from the Spaghetti
survey. The new data lead to a significant increase in the number of known
objects for Galactocentric radii beyond 50 kpc, which allows a reliable
determination of the radial velocity dispersion profile out to very large
distances. The radial velocity dispersion shows an almost constant value of 120
km/s out to 30 kpc and then continuously declines down to 50 km/s at about 120
kpc. This fall-off puts important constraints on the density profile and total
mass of the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. For a constant velocity
anisotropy, the isothermal profile is ruled out, while both a dark halo
following a truncated flat model of mass $1.2^{+1.8}_{-0.5}\times 10^{12}$
M_sun and an NFW profile of mass $0.8^{+1.2}_{-0.2}\times 10^{12}$ M_sun and
c=18 are consistent with the data. The significant increase in the number of
tracers combined with the large extent of the region probed by these has
allowed a more precise determination of the Milky Way mass in comparison to
previous works. We also show how different assumptions for the velocity
anisotropy affect the performance of the mass models.",2005-06-05T17:49:50Z
Molecular Gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) III. The warped LINER NGC3718,"We present the first interferometric observations of CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) line
emission from the warped LINER NGC3718, obtained with the IRAM PdBI. This L1.9
galaxy has a prominent dust lane and on kpc scales, a strongly warped atomic
and molecular gas disk. The molecular gas is closely associated with the dust
lane across the nucleus and its kinematic center is consistent with the mm
continuum AGN. A comparison of our interferometric mosaic data, which fully
cover the ~9kpc warped disk, with a previously obtained IRAM 30m single dish
CO(1-0) map shows that the molecular gas distribution in the disk is heavily
resolved by the PdBI map. After applying a short-spacing correction with the
IRAM 30m data, we find in total six main source components within the dust
lane: one associated with the nucleus, four symmetrically positioned on either
side at galactocentric distances of about 1.3kpc and 4.0kpc from the center,
and a sixth on the western side at ~3kpc with only a very weak eastern
counterpart. In the framework of a kinematic model using tilted rings, we
interpret the five symmetric source components as locations of strong orbital
crowding. We further find indications that the warp appears not only on kpc
scales, but continues down to 250pc. Besides the sixth feature on the western
side, the lower flux of the eastern components compared to the western ones
indicates an intrinsic large scale asymmetry in NGC3718 that cannot be
explained by the warp. Indications for a small scale asymmetry are also seen in
the central 600pc. These asymmetries might be evidence for a tidal interaction
with a companion galaxy (large scales) and gas accretion onto the nucleus
(small scales). Our study of NGC3718 is part of the NUGA project that aims at
investigating the different processes of gas accretion onto AGN.",2005-07-18T10:50:10Z
"VLTI/MIDI measurements of extended mid-infrared emission in the Galactic
  Center","We investigated with MIDI the extension of dusty mid-infrared excess sources
(IRS 1W, IRS 10W, IRS 2, IRS 8) in immediate vicinity to the black hole (BH) at
the GC. We derive 3$\sigma$ upper limits of the correlated fluxes of our target
sources which give direct constraints on the size of the emitting regions. Most
probably the emission originates from bow shocks generated by windy stars
ploughing through the dense matter of the Northern MiniSpiral.",2005-05-25T14:30:46Z
"Higher Criticism Statistic: Detecting and Identifying Non-Gaussianity in
  the WMAP First Year Data","Higher Criticism is a recently developed statistic for non-Gaussian
detection, proposed in Donoho & Jin 2004. We find that Higher Criticism is
useful for two purposes. First, Higher Criticism has competitive detection
power, and non-Gaussianity is detected at the level 99% in the first year WMAP
data. We find that the Higher Criticism value of WMAP is outside the 99%
confidence region at a wavelet scale of 5 degrees (99.46% of Higher Criticism
values based on simulated maps are below the values for WMAP). Second, Higher
Criticism offers a way to locate a small portion of data that accounts for the
non-Gaussianity. Using Higher Criticism, we have successfully identified a ring
of pixels centered at (l\approx 209 deg, b\approx -57 deg), which seems to
account for the observed detection of non-Gaussianity at the wavelet scale of 5
degrees. Note that the detection is achieved in wavelet space first. Second, it
is always possible that a fraction of pixels within the ring might deviate from
Gaussianity even if they do not appear to be above the 99% confidence level in
wavelet space. The location of the ring coincides with the cold spot detected
in Vielva et al. 2004 and Cruz et al. 2005.",2005-07-11T10:40:01Z
Binary star formation from ring fragmentation,"We present a simple model of binary star formation based on the assumption
that rotating prestellar cores collapse to form rings and these rings then
fragment into protostars. We assume that each ring spawns a small number (N <=
6) of protostars, and that the condensation of the protostars is sufficiently
rapid that they can subsequently be treated as point masses. We simulate the
dynamical evolution of a ring of N stars and record the properties of the
single stars, binaries and higher multiples that form as a result of the
dissolution of the ring. The masses of the individual stars in a ring are drawn
from a log-normal distribution with dispersion \sigma. This part of the model
is perfomed for many different realizations of the ring, to obtain good
statistics. The second part of the model is to convolve the results of these
dimensionless simulations, first with the distribution of core masses, which
yields the distributions of multiplicity,mass ratio and eccentricity, as a
function of primary mass; and second with the distribution of core angular
momenta, which yields the distributions of semi-major axis and period, again as
a function of primary mass. Using the observed distribution of core masses, and
the observed distribution of core angular momenta, our model is able to
reproduce the observed IMF, the observed high multiplicity frequency of
pre-Main Sequence stars, the observed distribution of separations, and -- for
long-period systems -- the observed distributions of eccentricity and
mass-ratio, provided we invoke N = 4 or 5 and $\sigma = 0.6$. We presume that
the reduced multiplicity frequency in the field, compared with young clusters,
is the result of dynamical interactions between stars formed in different cores
but the same cluster, following ring dissolution.",2005-03-18T12:39:54Z
"An analysis of the distribution of background star polarization in dark
  clouds","The polarization observed for stars background to dark clouds (Bok Globules)
is often used as diagnostic to study the ongoing star formation processes in
these clouds. Such polarization in the optical have been reported for eight
nearby clouds CB3, CB25, CB39, CB52, CB54, CB58, CB62 and CB246 in one of our
previous work (Sen et. al. 2000). With a view to understand the origin of this
polarization, the the present work attempts are made to look for any possible
relation between this observed polarization and other physical parameters in
the cloud (like temperature, turbulence etc.). The observed polarization does
not seem to be clearly related to the dust and gas temperatures (T_d and T_g)
in the cloud as expected from the Davis-Greenstein grain alignment mechanism
(Davis & Greenstein, 1952). However, the average observed polarization p_av
appears to be related to the turbulence delta V (measured by 12CO line width)
by the mathematical relation p_av=2.95exp(-0.24delta V). The possible realtion
between the direction of polarization vector and other physical parameters are
also discussed. For this analysis, in addition to the data on above eight
clouds, the data on CB4 (Kane et. al., 1995) are also included for comparison.",2005-04-26T06:58:30Z
"Spitzer Observations of G Dwarfs in the Pleiades: Circumstellar Debris
  Disks at 100 Myr Age","Fluxes and upper limits in the wavelength range from 3.6 to 70 microns from
the Spitzer Space Telescope are provided for twenty solar-mass Pleiades
members. One of these stars shows a probable mid-IR excess and two others have
possible excesses, presumably due to circumstellar debris disks. For the star
with the largest, most secure excess flux at MIPS wavelengths, HII1101, we
derive Log(L[dust]/L[Sun]) ~ -3.8 and an estimated debris disk mass of 4.2 x
10^-5 M(Earth) for an assumed uniform dust grain size of 10 microns If the
stars with detected excesses are interpreted as stars with relatively recent,
large collision events producing a transient excess of small dust particles,
the frequency of such disk transients is about ~ 10 % for our ~ 100 Myr,
Pleiades G dwarf sample. For the stars without detected 24-70 micron excesses,
the upper limits to their fluxes correspond to approximate 3 sigma upper limits
to their disk masses of 6 x 10^-6 M(Earth) using the MIPS 24 micron upper
limit, or 2 x 10^-4 M(Earth) using the MIPS 70 micron limit. These upper limit
disk masses (for ""warm"" and ""cold"" dust, respectively) are roughly consistent,
but somewhat lower than, predictions of a heuristic model for the evolution of
an ""average"" solar-mass star's debris disk based on extrapolation backwards in
time from current properties of the Sun's Kuiper belt.",2005-06-29T21:31:43Z
"Generation of Mesoscale Magnetic Fields and the Dynamics of Cosmic Ray
  Acceleration","The problem of the cosmic ray origin is discussed in connection with their
acceleration in supernova remnant shocks. The diffusive shock acceleration
mechanism is reviewed and its potential to accelerate particles to the maximum
energy of (presumably) galactic cosmic rays ($10^{18}eV $) is considered. It is
argued that to reach such energies, a strong magnetic field at scales larger
than the particle gyroradius must be created as a result of the acceleration
process, itself. One specific mechanism suggested here is based on the
generation of Alfven wave at the gyroradius scale with a subsequent transfer to
longer scales via interaction with strong acoustic turbulence in the shock
precursor. The acoustic turbulence in turn, may be generated by Drury
instability or by parametric instability of the Alfven waves.",2005-06-09T22:41:18Z
Optical Properties of 4248 IRAS Galaxies,"We have investigated optical properties of 4248 infrared galaxies (IRGs) by
positionally matching data from the IRAS and the SDSS DR3. Our sample includes
3 hyper luminous infrared galaxies (L >10^13Lsun) and 178 ultra luminous
infrared galaxies (10^12Lsun < L < 10^13Lsun). Our findings are as follows: (i)
more IR luminous galaxies tend to have smaller local galaxy density, being
consistent with the picture where luminous IRGs are created by the
merger-interaction of galaxies that happens more often in lower density
regions; (ii) the fractions of AGNs increase as a function of Lir; (iii) there
is a good correlation between Lir and L[OIII] for AGNs, suggesting both of the
parameters can be a good estimator of the total power of AGNs; (iv) a good
correlation is found between Lir and optically estimated star formation rate
(SFR) for star-forming galaxies, suggesting Lir is a good indicator of galaxy
SFR. However, caution is needed when SFR is estimated using Lir, i.e., high SFR
galaxies selected by Lir is frequently merger/interaction, whereas high SFR
galaxies selected by optical emission is often normal spiral or
Magellanic-cloud like irregular galaxies. (v) more IR luminous galaxies have
slightly larger Halpha/Hbeta ratio; (vi) more IR luminous galaxies have more
centrally-concentrated morphology, being consistent with the morphological
appearance of galaxy-galaxy merger remnants. Optical image of ultra/very
luminous infrared galaxies also show frequent signs of merger/interaction.
(vii) comparison with the SED synthesis models indicate that majority of
luminous infrared galaxies (L > 10^11Lsun) may be in a post-starburst phase,
sharing a similar (but not the same) merger/interaction origin with E+A
galaxies. (abridged)",2005-04-04T20:00:12Z
The Correlation of Metallicity Gradient with Galaxy Mass,"A number of previous studies have searched for a correlation between radial
metallicity gradients and early-type galaxy mass -- no convincing trends have
been found. Here we re-examine this issue with several key enhancements: using
total metallicity from studies that have broken the age-metallicity degeneracy,
excluding galaxies with young stellar ages (i.e. tho se that have experienced a
recent central starburst) and using the K-band to derive galaxy luminosities.
We find that Coma cluster galaxies have metallicity gradients which correlate
with galaxy mass. Furthermore, gradients have values similar to those of
monolithic collapse models. The combination of dissipative formation and energy
injection from supernova provides a mechanism for the trends with galaxy mass,
however other explanations are possible. Additional high quality observational
data is needed to further constrain the gas physics involved in galaxy
formation.",2005-04-18T06:14:09Z
"Constraints on holographic dark energy from type Ia supernova
  observations","In this paper, we use the type Ia supernovae data to constrain the
holographic dark energy model proposed by Li. We also apply a cosmic age test
to this analysis. We consider in this paper a spatially flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with matter component and holographic dark
energy component. The fit result shows that the case $c<1$ ($c=0.21$) is
favored, which implies that the holographic dark energy behaves as a
quintom-type dark energy. Furthermore, we also perform a joint analysis of
SNe+CMB+LSS to this model; the result is well improved, and still upholds the
quintom dark energy conclusion. The best fit results in our analysis are
$c=0.81$, $\Omega_m^0=0.28$, and $h=0.65$, which lead to the present equation
of state of dark energy $w_0=-1.03$ and the deceleration/acceleration
transition redshift $z_T=0.63$. Finally, an expected SNAP simulation using
$\Lambda$CDM as a fiducial model is performed on this model, and the result
shows that the holographic dark energy model takes on $c<1$ ($c=0.92$) even
though the dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant.",2005-06-14T15:12:02Z
Observation of small scale structure using sextupole lensing,"Weak gravitational lensing seeks to determine shear by measuring induced
quadrupole (elliptical) shapes in background galaxy images. Small impact
parameter (a few kpc) gravitational lensing by foreground core masses between 2
10^{9} and 2 10^{12} M_\odot will additionally induce a sextupole shape with
the quadrupole and sextupole minima aligned. This correlation in relative
orientation of the quadrupole and sextupole provides a sensitive method to
identify images which have been slightly curved by lensing events. A general
theoretical framework for sextupole lensing is developed which includes several
low order coefficients in a general lensing map. Tools to impute map
coefficients from the galaxy images are described and applied to the north
Hubble deep field. Instrumental PSFs, camera charge diffusion, and image
composition methods are modelled in the coefficient determination process.
Estimates of Poisson counting noise for each galaxy are used to cut galaxies
with signals too small to reliably establish curvature. Curved galaxies are
found to be spatially clumped, as would be expected if the curving were due to
small impact parameter lensing by localized ensembles of dark matter haloes.
Simulations provide an estimate of the total required lensing mass and the
acceptable mass range of the constituent haloes. The overdensities and
underdensities of visible galaxies and their locations in the Hubble foreground
is found to be consistent with our observations and their interpretation as
lensing events.",2005-04-08T19:51:11Z
J-resolved He I emission predictions in the low-density limit,"Determinations of the primordial helium abundance are used in precision
cosmological tests. These require highly accurate He I recombination rate
coefficients. Here we reconsider the formation of He I recombination lines in
the low-density limit. This is the simplest case and it forms the basis for the
more complex situation where collisions are important. The formation of a
recombination line is a two-step process, beginning with the capture of a
continuum electron into a bound state and followed by radiative cascade to
ground. The rate coefficient for capture from the continuum is obtained from
photoionization cross sections and detailed balancing, while radiative
transition probabilities determine the cascades. We have made every effort to
use today's best atomic data. Radiative decay rates are from Drake's
variational calculations, which include QED, fine structure, and
singlet-triplet mixing. Certain high-$L$ fine-structure levels do not have a
singlet-triplet distinction and the singlets and triplets are free to mix in
dipole-allowed radiative decays. We use quantum defect or hydrogenic
approximations to include levels higher than those treated in the variational
calculations. [Abstract clipped]",2005-04-04T21:03:36Z
INTEGRAL observations of SS433: Results of coordinated campaign,"Results of simultaneous INTEGRAL and optical observations of galactic
microquasar SS433 in May 2003 and INTEGRAL/RXTE observations in March 2004 are
presented. Persistent precessional variability with a maximum to minimum
uneclipsed hard X-ray flux ratio of \sim 4 is discovered. The 18-60 keV X-ray
eclipse is found to be in phase with optical and near infrared eclipses. The
orbital eclipse observed by INTEGRAL in May 2003 is at least two times deeper
and apparently wider than in soft X-ray band. The broadband X-ray spectrum
2-100 keV simultaneously detected by RXTE/INTEGRAL in March 2004 can be
described by bremsstrahlung emission from optically thin thermal plasma with
kT\sim 30 keV. The optical spectroscopy with the 6-m SAO BTA telescope
confirmed the optical companion to be an A5-A7 supergiant. For the first time,
spectorscopic indications of a strong heating effect in the optical star
atmosphere are found. The measurements of absorption lines which are presumably
formed in the non-illuminated side of the supergiant yield its radial velocity
semi-amplitude K_v=132\pm 9 km/s. The analysis of the observed hard X-ray light
curve and the eclipse duration, combined with spectroscopically found optical
star radial velocity corrected for the strong heating effect, allows us to
model SS433 as a massive X-ray binary. Assuming that the hard X-ray source in
SS433 is eclipsed by the donor star that exactly fills its Roche lobe, the
masses of the optical and compact components in SS433 are suggested to be
M_v\approx 30 M_\odot and M_x\approx 9M_\odot, respectively. This provides
further evidence that SS433 is a massive binary system with supercritical
accretion onto a black hole.",2005-03-16T16:15:37Z
"Afterglow Light Curves from Impulsive Relativistic Jets with an
  Unconventional Structure","The jet structure in gamma-ray burst (GRB) sources is still largely an open
question. The leading models invoke either (i) a roughly uniform jet with sharp
edges, or (ii) a jet with a narrow core and wide wings where the energy per
solid angle drops as a power law with the angle $\theta$ from the jet symmetry
axis. Recently, a two component jet model has also been considered, with a
narrow uniform jet of initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0 \gtrsim 100$ surrounded
by a wider uniform jet with $\Gamma_0 \sim 10-30$. Some models predict more
exotic jet profiles, such as a thin uniform ring (i.e. the outflow is bounded
by two concentric cones of half opening angle $\theta_c$ and $\theta_c +
\Delta\theta$, with $\Delta\theta \ll \theta_c$) or a fan (a thin outflow with
$\Delta\theta \ll 1$ along the rotational equator, $\theta_c = \pi/2 +
\Delta\theta/2$). In this paper we calculate the expected afterglow light
curves from such jet structures, using a simple formalism that is developed
here for this purpose, and could also have other applications. These light
curves are qualitatively compared to observations of GRB afterglows. It is
shown that the two component jet model cannot produce sharp features in the
afterglow model due to the deceleration of the wide jet or the narrow jet
becoming visible at lines of sight outside of it. We find that a ""ring"" shaped
jet or a ""fan"" shaped jet produce a jet break in the afterglow light curve that
is too shallow compared to observations, where the change in the temporal decay
index across the jet break is about half of that for a uniform conical jet. For
a ""ring"" jet, the jet break is divided into two distinct and smaller breaks,
the first occurring when $\gamma\Delta\theta \sim 1-2$ and the second when
$\gamma\theta_c \sim 1/2$.",2005-04-11T23:05:41Z
"Obscured Activity: AGN, Quasars, Starbursts and ULIGs observed by the
  Infrared Space Observatory","Some of the most active galaxies in the Universe are obscured by large
quantities of dust and emit a substantial fraction of their bolometric
luminosity in the infrared. Observations of these infrared luminous galaxies
with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) have provided a relatively unabsorbed
view to the sources fuelling this active emission. The improved sensitivity,
spatial resolution and spectroscopic capability of ISO over its predecessor
Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), has enabled significant advances in the
understanding of the infrared properties of active galaxies. ISO surveyed a
wide range of active galaxies which, in the context of this review, includes
those powered by intense bursts of star-formation as well as those containing a
dominant active galactic nucleus (AGN). Mid infrared imaging resolved for the
first time the dust enshrouded nuclei in many nearby galaxies, while a new era
in infrared spectroscopy was opened by probing a wealth of atomic, ionic and
molecular lines as well as broad band features in the mid and far infrared.
This was particularly useful since it resulted in the understanding of the
power production, excitation and fuelling mechanisms in the nuclei of active
galaxies including the intriguing but so far elusive ultraluminous infrared
galaxies. Detailed studies of various classes of AGN and quasars greatly
improved our understanding of the unification scenario. Far-infrared imaging
and photometry also revealed the presence of a new very cold dust component in
galaxies and furthered our knowledge of the far-infrared properties of faint
starbursts, ULIGs and quasars. We summarise almost nine years of key results
based upon ISO data spanning the full range of luminosity and type of active
galaxies.",2005-07-07T10:55:34Z
"Particle-In-Cell Simulations of a Nonlinear Transverse Electromagnetic
  Wave in a Pulsar Wind Termination Shock","A 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell code is used to investigate the
propagation of a large-amplitude, superluminal, nearly transverse
electromagnetic (TEM) wave in a relativistically streaming electron-positron
plasma with and without a shock. In the freestreaming, unshocked case, the
analytic TEM dispersion relation is verified, and the streaming is shown to
stabilize the wave against parametric instabilities. In the confined, shocked
case, the wave induces strong, coherent particle oscillations, heats the
plasma, and modifies the shock density profile via ponderomotive effects. The
wave decays over $\gtrsim 10^2$ skin depths; the decay length scale depends
primarily on the ratio between the wave frequency and the effective plasma
frequency, and on the wave amplitude. The results are applied to the
termination shock of the Crab pulsar wind, where the decay length-scale (at
least 0.05"") might be comparable to the thickness of filamentary, variable
substructure observed in the optical and X-ray wisps and knots.",2005-08-08T14:00:27Z
The Cosmic Near Infrared Background: Remnant Light from Early Stars,"The redshifted ultraviolet light from early stars at z ~ 10 contributes to
the cosmic near infrared background. We present detailed calculations of its
spectrum with various assumptions about metallicity and mass spectrum of early
stars. We show that if the near infrared background has a stellar origin,
metal-free stars are not the only explanation of the excess near infrared
background; stars with metals (e.g. Z=1/50 Z_sun) can produce the same amount
of background intensity as the metal-free stars. We quantitatively show that
the predicted average intensity at 1-2 microns is essentially determined by the
efficiency of nuclear burning in stars, which is not very sensitive to
metallicity. We predict \nu I_\nu / \dot{\rho}_* ~ 4-8 nW m^-2 sr^-1, where
\dot{\rho_*} is the mean star formation rate at z=7-15 (in units of M_sun yr^-1
Mpc^-3) for stars more massive than 5 M_sun. On the other hand, since we have
very little knowledge about the form of mass spectrum of early stars,
uncertainty in the average intensity due to the mass spectrum could be large.
An accurate determination of the near infrared background allows us to probe
formation history of early stars, which is difficult to constrain by other
means. While the star formation rate at z=7-15 inferred from the current data
is significantly higher than the local rate at z<5, it does not rule out the
stellar origin of the cosmic near infrared background. In addition, we show
that a reasonable initial mass function, coupled with this star formation rate,
does not over-produce metals in the universe in most cases, and may produce as
little as less than 1 % of the metals observed in the universe today.",2005-08-08T16:42:15Z
Dark energy and the evolution of spherical overdensities,"We use the non-linear spherical model in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies
with dark energy to investigate the effects of dark energy on the growth of
structure and the formation of virialised structures. We consider dark energy
models with a constant equation of state parameter w. For -1<w<-1/3, clusters
form earlier and are more concentrated in quintessence than in LambdaCDM
models, but they form later and are less concentrated than in the corresponding
open model with the same matter density and no dark energy. We point out some
confusion in the literature around the expression of the collapse factor (ratio
of the radius of the sphere at virialisation to that at turn-around) derived
from the virial theorem. We use the Sheth & Tormen extension of the
Press-Schechter framework to calculate the evolution of the cluster abundance
in different models and show the sensitivity of the cluster abundance to both
the amplitude of the mass fluctuations, sigma8, and the sigma8-w normalisation,
selected to match either the cosmic microwave background observations or the
abundance of X-ray clusters.",2005-04-21T12:05:37Z
Molecular hydrogen in the diffuse interstellar medium at high redshift,"Physical conditions within DLAs can reveal the star formation history,
determine the chemical composition of the associated ISM, and hence document
the first steps in the formation of present day galaxies. Here we present
calculations that self-consistently determine the gas ionization, level
populations (atomic fine-structure levels and rotational levels of H_2), grain
physics, and chemistry. We show that for a low-density gas (n< 0.1 cm^-3) the
meta-galactic UV background due to quasars is sufficient to maintain H_2 column
densities below the detection limit (i.e N(H_2)< 10^14 cm^-2) irrespective of
the metallicity and dust content in the gas. Such a gas will have a 21 cm spin
temperature in excess of 7000 K and very low C I and C II* column densities for
H I column densities typically observed in DLAs. We show that the observed
properties of the ~15% per cent of the DLAs that do show detectable H_2
absorption cannot be reproduced with only the quasar dominated meta-galactic UV
radiation field. Gas with higher densities (n>10 cm^-3), a moderate radiation
field (flux density one to ten times that of the background radiation of the
Galactic ISM), the observed range of metallicity and dust-to-gas ratio
reproduce all the observed properties of the DLAs that show H_2 absorption
lines. This favors the presence of ongoing star formation in DLAs with H_2. The
absence of detectable H_2 and C I absorption in a large fraction of DLAs can be
explained if they originate either in a low-density gas or in a high-density
gas with a large ambient radiation field. The absence of 21 cm absorption and C
II* absorption will be consistent with the first possibility. The presence of
21 cm absorption and strong C II* without H_2 and C I absorption will suggest
the second alternative. (Abridged)",2005-06-23T09:45:48Z
"Prompt and afterglow early X-ray phases in the comoving frame. Evidence
  for Universal properties?","We analyze the Swift XRT light curves and spectra of the gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) for which the redshift has been measured. The sample consists of seven
GRBs. The soft X-ray light curves of all these GRBs are separated into at least
two morphological classes: 1) those starting off with a very steep light curve
decay and 2) those showing a rather mild initial decay. This initial decay is
followed by a flattening and by a further steepening. During these transitions
the soft X-ray spectrum of these GRBs remains constant within the observational
errors (except for one case, GRB050319). For the first time we are able to
exploit the early light curve of GRB afterglows in the comoving frame. Besides
the temporal and spectral behavior we find that the energy of the afterglow
emitted in the (rest frame) time interval 20-200 s and 1300-12600 s after the
trigger correlates with the mean energy of the prompt emission, hinting at a
close link between the two. Averaging over the bursts that have a rather well
sampled light curve and starting immediately after the prompt phase, the energy
emitted in the soft X-rays is about 3% of the energy emitted during the prompt
phase, except for GRB050315, where the soft X-ray emission is as high as 14% of
the prompt emission.",2005-06-20T13:29:19Z

Jet Formation in Black Hole Accretion Systems II: Numerical Models,"In a companion theory paper, we presented a unified model of jet formation.
We suggested that primarily two types of relativistic jets form near accreting
black holes: a potentially ultrarelativistic Poynting-dominated jet and a
Poynting-baryon jet. We showed that, for the collapsar model, the
neutrino-driven enthalpy flux (classic fireball model) is probably dominated by
the Blandford-Znajek energy flux, which predicts a jet Lorentz factor of
$\Gamma\sim 100-1000$. We showed that radiatively inefficient AGN, such as M87,
are synchrotron-cooling limited to $\Gamma\sim 2-10$. Radiatively efficient
x-ray binaries, such as GRS1915+105, are Compton-drag limited to $\Gamma
\lesssim 2$, but the jet may be destroyed by Compton drag. However, the
Poynting-baryon jet is a collimated outflow with $\Gamma \sim 1-3$. Here we
present general relativistic hydromagnetic simulations of black hole accretion
with pair creation used to simulate jet formation in GRBs, AGN, and x-ray
binaries. Our collapsar model shows the development of a patchy ``magnetic
fireball'' with typically $\Gamma\sim 100-1000$ and a Gaussian structure.
Temporal variability of the jet is dominated by toroidal field instabilities
for $\gtrsim 10^2$ gravitational radii. A broader Poynting-baryon jet with
$\Gamma\sim 1.5$ could contribute to a supernova.",2005-06-16T06:13:47Z
"On the periodic clustering of cosmic ray exposure ages of iron
  meteorites","Two recent papers claimed to have found a periodic variation of the galactic
cosmic ray (CR) flux over the last 1-2 Gyr, using the CR exposure ages of iron
meteorites. This was attributed to higher CR flux during the passage of the
Earth through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, as suggested by models. The
derived period was 143+-10 Myrs. We perform a more detailed analysis of the CR
exposure ages on the same data set, using extensive simulation to estimate the
influence of different error sources on the significance of the periodicity
signal. We find no evidence for significant clustering of the CR exposure ages
at a 143 Myr period nor for any other period between 100 and 250 Myrs. Rather,
we find the data to be consistent with being drawn from a uniform distribution
of CR exposure ages. The different conclusion of the original studies is due to
their neglecting the influence of (i) data treatment on the statistics, (ii)
several error sources, and (iii) number statistics.",2005-04-06T18:22:18Z
Peak energy clustering and efficiency in compact objects,"We study the properties of plasmas containing a low energy thermal photon
component at comoving temperature \theta \equiv kT'/m_e c^2 \sim 10^{-5} -
10^{-2} interacting with an energetic electron component, characteristic of,
e.g., the dissipation phase of relativistic outflows in gamma-ray bursts
(GRB's), X-ray flashes, and blazars. We show that, for scattering optical
depths larger than a few, balance between Compton and inverse-Compton
scattering leads to the accumulation of electrons at values of $\gamma\beta ~
0.15 - 0.3$. For optical depths larger than ~ 100, this leads to a peak in the
comoving photon spectrum at 1-10 keV, very weakly dependent on the values of
the free parameters. In particular, these results are applicable to the
internal shock model of GRB, as well as to slow dissipation models, e.g. as
might be expected from reconnection, if the dissipation occurs at a
sub-photospheric radii. For GRB bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100, this results in
observed spectral peaks clustering in the 0.1-1 MeV range, with conversion
efficiencies of electron into photon energy in the BATSE range of ~ 30%.",2005-04-15T12:20:36Z
"Cosmological Implications of the Uncertainty in H- Destruction Rate
  Coefficients","In primordial gas, molecular hydrogen forms primarily through associative
detachment of H- and H, thereby destroying the H-. The H- anion can also be
destroyed by a number of other reactions, most notably by mutual neutralization
with protons. However, neither the associative detachment nor the mutual
neutralization rate coefficients are well determined: both may be uncertain by
as much as an order of magnitude. This introduces a corresponding uncertainty
into the H2 formation rate, which may have cosmological implications. Here, we
examine the effect that these uncertainties have on the formation of H2 and the
cooling of protogalactic gas in a variety of situations. We show that the
effect is particularly large for protogalaxies forming in previously ionized
regions, affecting our predictions of whether or not a given protogalaxy can
cool and condense within a Hubble time, and altering the strength of the
ultraviolet background that is required to prevent collapse.",2005-06-09T22:43:51Z
"Induced two-photon decay of the 2s level and the rate of cosmological
  hydrogen recombination","Induced emission due to the presence of soft CMB photons slightly increases
the two-photon decay rate of the 2s level of hydrogen defining the rate of
cosmological recombination. This correspondingly changes the degree of
ionization, the visibility function and the resulting primordial temperature
anisotropies and polarization of the CMB on the percent level. These changes
exceed the precision of the widely used CMBFAST and CAMB codes by more than one
order of magnitude and can be easily taken into account.",2005-08-04T20:08:18Z
"Radial Velocity Jitter in Stars from the California and Carnegie Planet
  Search at Keck Observatory","I present an empirical model for predicting a star's radial velocity jitter
from its B-V color, activity level, and absolute magnitude. This model is based
on observations of 450 well- observed stars from Keck Observatory for the
California and Carnegie Planet Search Program. The model includes noise from
both astrophysical sources and systematic errors, and describes jitter as
generally increasing with a star's activity and height above the main sequence.",2005-05-11T00:17:06Z
"Orbits in Extended Mass Distributions: General Results and the
  Spirographic Approximation","This paper explores orbits in extended mass distributions and develops an
analytic approximation scheme based on epicycloids (spirograph patterns). We
focus on the Hernquist potential which provides a good model for many
astrophysical systems, including elliptical galaxies, dark matter halos, and
young embedded star clusters. For a given potential, one can readily calculate
orbital solutions as a function of energy and angular momentum using numerical
methods. In contrast, this paper presents a number of analytic results for the
Hernquist potential and proves a series of general constraints showing that
orbits have similar properties for any extended mass distribution (including,
e.g., the NFW profile). We discuss circular orbits, radial orbits, zero energy
orbits, different definitions of eccentricity, analogs of Kepler's law, the
definition of orbital elements, and the relation of these orbits to spirograph
patterns (epicycloids). Over much of parameter space the orbits can be
adequately described (with accuracy better than 10%) using the parametric
equations of epicycloids, thereby providing an analytic description of the
orbits. As an application of this formal development, we find a solution for
the orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud in the potential of our Galaxy.",2005-04-29T13:34:45Z
"Polarized Cosmological Gravitational Waves from Primordial Helical
  Turbulence","We show that helical turbulence produced during a first-order phase
transition generates circularly polarized cosmological gravitational waves
(GWs). The characteristic frequency of these GWs for an extreme case of the
phase transition model is around $10^{-3}$ --- $10^{-2}$ Hz with an energy
density parameter as high as $10^{-12}$ --- $10^{-11}$. The possibility of
detection is briefly discussed.",2005-05-31T17:27:50Z
Theoretical Aspects of Gravitational Lensing in TeVeS,"Since Bekenstein's (2004) creation of his Tensor-Vector-Scalar theory
(TeVeS), the Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm has been redeemed from
the embarrassment of lacking a relativistic version. One primary success of
TeVeS is that it provides an enhancement of gravitational lensing, which could
not be achieved by other MONDian theories. Following Bekenstein's work, we
investigate the phenomena of gravitational lensing including deflection angles,
lens equations and time delay. We find that the deflection angle would maintain
its value while the distance of closest approach vary in the MOND regime, this
coincides with the conclusion of Mortlock and Turner's (2001) intuitional
approach. Moreover, the scalar field, which is introduced to enhance the
deflection angle in TeVeS, contributes a negative effect on the potential time
delay. Unfortunately this phenomenon is unmeasurable in lensing systems where
we can only observe the time delay between two images for a given source.
However, this measurable time delay offers another constraint on the mass ratio
of the DM and MOND scenarios, which in general differs from that given by the
deflection angle. In other words, for a lensing system, if two masses, m_gN and
m_gM, are mutually alternatives for the deflection angles in their own
paradigm, regarding the time delay they are in general in an exclusive
relation.",2005-07-13T19:08:43Z
White Dwarfs in NGC 6791: Avoiding the Helium Flash,"We propose that the anomalously bright white dwarf luminosity function
observed in NGC 6791 (Bedin et al 2005) is the consequence of the formation of
0.5 Msun white dwarfs with Helium cores instead of Carbon cores. This may
happen if mass loss during the ascent of the Red Giant Branch is strong enough
to prevent a star from reaching the Helium flash. Such a model can explain the
slower white dwarf cooling (relative to standard models) and fits naturally
with scenarios advanced to explain Extreme Horizontal Branch stars, a
population of which are also found in this cluster.",2005-07-12T20:03:11Z
Why Are Radio-Galaxies Prolific Producers of Type Ia Supernovae?,"An analysis of SNIa events in early type galaxies from the Cappellaro et al
(1999) database provides conclusive evidence that the rate of type Ia
Supernovae (SNe) in radio-loud galaxies is about 4 times higher than the rate
measured in radio-quiet galaxies, i.e. SNIa-rate$(radio-loud galaxies) =
0.43^{+0.19}_{-0.14}h^2_{75}$ SNu as compared to SNIa-rate$(radio-quiet
galaxies) = 0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.03}h^2_{75}$ SNu. The actual value of the
enhancement is likely to be in the range $\sim 2-7$ (P$\sim 10^{-4}$). This
finding puts on robust empirical grounds the results obtained by Della Valle &
Panagia (2003) on the basis of a smaller sample of SNe. We analyse the possible
causes of this result and conclude that the enhancement of SNIa explosion rate
in radio-loud galaxies has the same origin as their being strong radio sources,
but there is no causality link between the two phenomena. We argue that
repeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of early type galaxies with
dwarf companions, on times-scale of about 1 Gyr, are responsible for inducing
both strong radio activity observed in $\sim$14% of early type galaxies and to
supply an adequate number of SNIa progenitors to the stellar population of
ellipticals.",2005-04-04T21:45:31Z
The Accretion of Dark Energy onto a Black Hole,"The stationary, spherically symmetric accretion of dark energy onto a
Schwarzschild black hole is considered in terms of relativistic hydrodynamics.
The approximation of an ideal fluid is used to model the dark energy. General
expressions are derived for the accretion rate of an ideal fluid with an
arbitrary equation of state p=p(\rho) onto a black hole. The black hole mass
was found to decrease for the accretion of phantom energy. The accretion
process is studied in detail for two dark energy models that admit an
analytical solution: a model with a linear equation of state,
p=\alpha(\rho-\rho_0), and a Chaplygin gas. For one of the special cases of a
linear equation of state, an analytical expression is derived for the accretion
rate of dark energy onto a moving and rotating black hole. The masses of all
black holes are shown to approach zero in cosmological models with phantom
energy in which the Big Rip scenario is realized.",2005-05-31T11:25:13Z
"Ultracompact AM CVn Binaries from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Three
  Candidates Plus the First Confirmed Eclipsing System","AM CVn systems are a rare (about a dozen previously known) class of
cataclysmic variables, arguably encompassing the shortest orbital periods (down
to about 10 minutes) of any known binaries. Both binary components are thought
to be degenerate (or partially so), likely with mass-transfer from a
helium-rich donor onto a white dwarf, driven by gravitational radiation.
Although rare, AM CVn systems are of high interest as possible SN Ia
progenitors, and because they are predicted to be common sources of gravity
waves in upcoming experiments such as LISA. We have identified four new AM CVn
candidates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectral database. All four
show hallmark spectroscopic characteristics of the AM CVn class: each is devoid
of hydrogen features, and instead shows a spectrum dominated by helium. All
four show double-peaked emission, indicative of helium-dominated accretion
disks. Limited time-series CCD photometric follow-on data have been obtained
for three of the new candidates from the ARC 3.5m; most notably, a 28.3 minute
binary period with sharp, deep eclipses is discovered in one case, SDSS
J0926+3624. This is the first confirmed eclipsing AM CVn, and our data allow
initial estimates of binary parameters for this ultracompact system. The four
new SDSS objects also provide a substantial expansion of the currently
critically-small sample of AM CVn systems.",2005-06-29T18:27:15Z
"New Estimates of the Solar-Neighborhood Massive-Stars Birthrate and the
  Galactic Supernova Rate","The birthrate of stars of masses > 10 solar masses is estimated from a sample
of just over 400 O3-B2 dwarfs within 1.5 kpc of the Sun and the result
extrapolated to estimate the galactic supernova rate contributed by such stars.
The solar-neighborhood galactic-plane massive star birthrate is estimated at
176 stars per cubic kpc per million years. Based on a model where the galactic
stellar density distribution comprises a disk plus central hole like that of
the dust infrared emission (Drimmel & Spergel 2001 ApJ 556, 181) the galactic
supernova rate is estimated as probably not less than 1 nor more than 2 per
century and the number of O3-B2 dwarfs within the solar circle as ~ 200,000.",2005-06-28T21:41:50Z
Spectroscopic Observations and Analysis of the Unusual Type Ia SN 1999ac,"We present optical spectra of the peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 1999ac.
The data extend from -15 to +42 days with respect to B-band maximum and reveal
an event that is unusual in several respects. Prior to B-band maximum, the
spectra resemble those of SN 1999aa, a slowly declining event, but possess
stronger SiII and CaII signatures (more characteristic of a spectroscopically
normal SN). Spectra after B-band maximum appear more normal. The expansion
velocities inferred from the Iron lines appear to be lower than average;
whereas, the expansion velocity inferred from Calcium H and K are higher than
average. The expansion velocities inferred from SiII are among the slowest ever
observed, though SN 1999ac is not particularly dim. The analysis of the
parameters v_10, R(SiII), dv(SiII)/dt, and d_m15 further underlines the unique
characteristics of SN 1999ac. We find convincing evidence of CII 6580 in the
day -15 spectrum with ejection velocity v > 16,000 km/s, but this signature
disappears by day -9. This rapid evolution at early times highlights the
importance of extremely early-time spectroscopy.",2005-07-12T14:04:54Z
"Search for Point Sources of Ultra--High-Energy Cosmic Rays Above 10^19
  eV Using a Maximum Likelihood Ratio Test","We present the results of a search for cosmic ray point sources at energies
above 10^19 eV in the HiRes stereo data set. The analysis is based on a maximum
likelihood ratio test using the probability density function for each event
rather than requiring an a priori choice of a fixed angular bin size. The
search is extended to the combined data set of HiRes data above 10^19 eV and
AGASA data above 4.0 10^19 eV. In both cases, no statistically significant
clustering of events consistent with a point source is found.",2005-07-25T14:32:20Z
"Whims of an Accreting Young Brown Dwarf: Exploring Emission Line
  Variability of 2MASSW J1207334-393254","We report the first comprehensive study of emission line variability in an
accreting young brown dwarf. We have collected 14 high-resolution optical
spectra of 2MASSW J1207334-393254 (M8), a likely member of the nearby
8-million-year-old TW Hydrae association. These spectra show a variety of
emission lines that are commonly seen in classical T Tauri stars. Halpha line
in particular shows dramatic changes in shape and intensity in our dataset,
both on timescales of several weeks and several hours. In spectra from
late-January, the line is relatively weak and only slightly asymmetric. Spectra
from mid- and late-March show intense, broad and asymmetric Halpha emission,
indicative of on-going disk accretion. We estimate that the accretion rate
could have changed by a factor of 5-10 over ~6 weeks in this brown dwarf. March
spectra also reveal significant `quasi-periodic' changes in the Halpha line
profile over the course of a night, from clearly double-peaked to nearly
symmetric. These nightly profile changes, roughly consistent with the brown
dwarf's rotation period, could be the result of a redshifted absorption feature
coming into and out of our line of sight; when the profile is double-peaked we
may be looking into an accretion column, flowing from the inner disk edge on to
the central object, indicating that the accretion is probably channelled along
the magnetic field lines. Our findings provide strong support for the
magnetospheric accretion scenario, and thus for the existence of large-scale
magnetic fields, in the sub-stellar regime (abridged).",2005-07-06T07:14:23Z
Measuring the Primordial Deuterium Abundance During the Cosmic Dark Ages,"We discuss how measurements of fluctuations in the absorption of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) photons by neutral gas during the cosmic dark ages,
at redshifts z ~ 7--200, could reveal the primordial deuterium abundance of the
Universe. The strength of the cross-correlation of brightness-temperature
fluctuations due to resonant absorption of CMB photons in the 21-cm line of
neutral hydrogen with those due to resonant absorption of CMB photons in the
92-cm line of neutral deuterium is proportional to the fossil deuterium to
hydrogen ratio [D/H] fixed during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Although
technically challenging, this measurement could provide the cleanest possible
determination of [D/H], free from contamination by structure formation
processes at lower redshifts, and has the potential to improve BBN constraints
to the baryon density of the Universe \Omega_{b} h^2. We also present our
results for the thermal spin-change cross-section for deuterium-hydrogen
scattering, which may be useful in a more general context than we describe
here.",2005-05-09T20:00:10Z
"V453 Oph: a s-process enriched, but carbon-deficient RV Tauri star of
  low intrinsic metallicity","This paper reports the detection of a heavy element enriched RV Tauri
variable with an abundance pattern that differs significantly from a standard
s-process enriched object: V453 Oph. Based on optical high-resolution spectra,
we determined that this object of low intrinsic metallicity ([Fe/H] = -2.2) has
a mild, but significant, enrichment ([s/Fe] ~ +0.5) of heavy elements for which
the distribution points to slow neutron capture nucleosynthesis. This result is
strengthened by a comparative analysis to the non-enriched RV Tauri star DS Aqr
([s/Fe] = 0.0). Although V453 Oph is the first RV Tauri star showing a strong
s-process signature, it is NOT accompanied by C enhancement, challenging our
current nucleosynthetic models of post-AGB stars that predict a simultaneous
enrichment in C and s-process elements. The low N abundance excludes CN cycling
as being responsible for the low C abundance. We explore three different
scenarios to explain the heavy element distribution in this evolved object: an
enrichment of the parental cloud, an accretion scenario in which the chemical
patterns were acquired by mass transfer in a binary system and an intrinsic
enrichment by dredge-up.",2005-04-27T11:42:04Z
"A Photometric Study of the Light Variations of the Triple System DG
  Leonis","Multi-site and multi-year differential photometry of the triple star DG Leo
reveals a complex frequency spectrum that can be modelled as the combination of
at least three Delta Scuti type frequencies in the range 11.5-13 c/d (with
semi-amplitudes of 2-7 mmag) and a superimposed slow variability of larger
amplitude. The period of the slow variation fits very well with half the
orbital period of the inner spectroscopic binary indicating the presence of
ellipsoidal variations caused by the tidally deformed components in a close
configuration. These findings, together with the results of a recent
spectroscopic analysis (showing that the system consists of a pair of mild Am
stars and one A-type component of normal solar composition), infer that DG Leo
is an extremely interesting asteroseismic target. Identification of which
component(s) of this multiple system is (or are) pulsating and determination of
the excited pulsation modes will both contribute to a much better understanding
of the non-trivial link between multiplicity, chemical composition, rotation,
and pulsation in the lower part of the classical Cepheid instability strip.",2005-05-02T13:30:25Z
"A Radio Counterpart for the Unidentified TeV Source HESS J1813-178: The
  Radio-Gamma-Ray Connection","We discovered independently the shell-type supernova remnant G12.82-0.02,
recently reported by Brogan et al. (2005), which is coincident with the
unidentified TeV gamma-ray source revealed in the HESS survey of the Galactic
plane. Estimating the ambient starlight at the location of this source from the
integrated Ly alpha luminosity of the nearby H II region W33, we conclude that
inverse Compton emission is a viable explanation for the observed TeV emission.
Examining remnants in the survey of Aharonian et al. (2005a) including those
detected above 200 Gev and those not detected, we find a strikingly large range
of more than three orders of magnitude in the radio to TeV flux ratios. We
briefly explore the possible explanations of this range and the implications
for the TeV emission mechanism.",2005-05-18T20:17:53Z
Multigroup Models of the Convective Epoch in Core Collapse Supernovae,"Understanding the explosion mechanism of core collapse supernovae is a
problem that has plagued nuclear astrophysicists since the first computational
models of this phenomenon were carried out in the 1960s. Our current theories
of this violent phenomenon center around multi-dimensional effects involving
radiation-hydrodynamic flows of hot, dense matter and neutrinos. Modeling these
multi-dimensional radiative flows presents a computational challenge that will
continue to stress high-performance computing beyond the teraflop to the
petaflop level. In this paper we describe a few of the scientific discoveries
that we have made via terascale computational simulations of supernovae under
the auspices of the SciDAC-funded Terascale Supernova Initiative.",2005-07-12T18:16:20Z
A Supernova Factory in Mrk 273?,"We report on 1.6 and 5.0 GHz observations of the ultraluminous infrared
galaxy (ULIRG) Mrk 273, using the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the
Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN). We also make use of
published 1.4 GHz VLBA observations of Mrk 273 by Carilli & Taylor (2000). Our
5 GHz images have a maximum resolution of 5-10 mas, which corresponds to linear
resolutions of 3.5-7 pc at the distance of Mrk 273, and are the most sensitive
high-resolution radio observations yet made of this ULIRG. Component N1, often
pinpointed as a possible AGN, displays a steep spectral index ($\alpha = 1.2
\pm 0.1; S_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$); hence it is very difficult to reconcile
with N1 being an AGN, and rather suggests that the compact nonthermal radio
emission is produced by an extremely high luminous individual radio supernova
(RSN), or a combination of unresolved emission from nested supernova remnants
(SNR), luminous RSNe, or both. Component N2 is partly resolved out into several
compact radio sources --none of which clearly dominates-- and a region of
extended emission about 30 pc in size. The integrated spectral index of this
region is flat ($\alpha = 0.15 \pm 0.1$), which can be interpreted as due to a
superposition of several unresolved components, e.g., RSNe or SNRs, whose radio
emission peaks at different frequencies and is partially free-free absorbed.
The overall extended radio emission from component N is typical of nonthermal,
optically thin radio emission ($\alpha = 0.8 \pm 0.1$), and its 1.4 GHz
luminosity ($L_{1.4 \rm GHz} = (2.2 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{23} $ WHz$^{-1}$) is
consistent with being produced by relativistic electrons diffused away from
supernova remnants in an outburst.",2005-05-18T11:13:17Z
Galactic Centre stellar winds and Sgr A* accretion,"(ABRIDGED) We present in detail our new 3D numerical models for the accretion
of stellar winds on to Sgr A*. In our most sophisticated models, we put stars
on realistic orbits around Sgr A*, include `slow' winds (300 km/s), and account
for radiative cooling. We first model only one phase `fast' stellar winds (1000
km/s). For wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is Mdot ~ 1e-5
Msun/yr, fluctuates by < 10%, and is in a good agreement with previous models.
In contrast, Mdot decreases by an order of magnitude for stars following
circular orbits, and fluctuates by ~ 50%. Then we allow a fraction of stars to
produce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively, forming cold clumps
immersed into the X-ray emitting gas. We test two orbital configurations for
the stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs
with perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive
to the orbits. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, with an
almost constant Mdot ~ 3e-6 Msun/yr, consistent with Chandra observations. The
cold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful episodes which may give
rise to large amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time scales
of 10s to 100s of years. The circularisation radii for the flows are ~ 1e3 and
1e4 Rsch, for the one and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never
forming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work.
Our work suggests that, averaged over time scales of 100s to 1000s of years,
the radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher
than it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion
modelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the
wind properties and stellar orbits.",2005-05-18T17:06:44Z
First Results from the CHARA Array. II. A Description of the Instrument,"The CHARA Array is a six 1-m telescope optical/IR interferometric array

Light-cone Simulations: Evolution of dark matter haloes,"We present a new fast method for simulating pencil-beam type light-cones,
using the MLAPM-code (Multi Level Adaptive Particle Mesh) with light-cone
additions. We show that by a careful choice of the light-cone orientation, it
is possible to avoid extra periodicities in the light-cone. As an example, we
apply the method to simulate a 6 Gpc deep light-cone, create the dark matter
halo catalogue for the light-cone and study the evolution of haloes from $z=6$
up to the present time. We determine the spatial density of the haloes, their
large-scale correlation function, and study the evolution of the mass function.
We find a surprisingly simple relation for the dependence of halo maximum mass
on redshift, and apply it to derive redshift limits for bright quasars.",2005-07-08T08:23:29Z
"A Neutral Hydrogen Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud: Aperture
  Synthesis and Multibeam Data Combined","Using a Fourier-plane technique, we have merged HI ATCA and Parkes data sets
providing an accurate set of images of the LMC sensitive to structure on scales
of 15 pc (for an LMC distance of 55 kpc) upwards. The spatial dynamic range
(2.8 orders of magnitude), velocity resolution (1.649 km/s), brightness
temperature sensitivity (2.4 K) and column density sensitivity ($8.9 \times 10^
{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ per 1.649 km/s channel) allow for the studies of phenomena
ranging from the galaxy-wide interaction of the LMC with its close neighbours
to the small-scale injection of energy from supernovae and stellar associations
into the ISM of the LMC. We find that a previous analysis of the holes and
shells (Kim et al. 1999) in the HI distribution shows the same power- law
behavior with that of clumps. The measured perimeter P and measured enclosed
area A of each HI cloud in a log-log plot give us a set of points lying along
with a slope of D/2 = 0.73 $\pm$ 0.1. The relation between area and perimeter
of each identified HI cloud, P $\propto$ $A^{D/2}$, can determine the fractal
dimension D=1.47 $\pm$ 0.2 of a cloud boundary (Vogelaar & Wakker 1994;
Williams, Blitz, & McKee 2000). The measured fractal dimension of HI clouds in
the LMC is similar to the dimension, D=1.4, found in many studies of the
molecular ISM.",2005-06-10T02:17:00Z
On the equation of state of Dark Energy,"The formalism in order to obtain the Dark Energy equation of state is
extended to non-flat universes and we consider the inequalities that must be
satisfied by Phantom Dark Energy in this case. We show that due to a
non-vanishing spatial curvature satisfying the observational bounds, the
uncertainty on the determination of the Dark Energy equation of state parameter
$w$, when it is taken constant, can be significant and that it is minimal for
some redshift $z_{cr}\sim 3$. We consider the potential of future measurements
of the gravitational waves emitted by binaries at high redshifts $z>z_{cr}$ to
reduce this uncertainty. Results obtained here should also be relevant for a
weakly varying equation of state with $w\approx -1$.",2005-07-12T14:17:17Z
Mass-radius relations for massive white dwarf stars,"We present detailed theoretical mass-radius relations for massive white dwarf
stars with oxygen-neon cores. This work is motivated by recent observational
evidence about the existence of white dwarf stars with very high surface
gravities. Our results are based on evolutionary calculations that take into
account the chemical composition expected from the evolutionary history of
massive white dwarf progenitors. We present theoretical mass-radius relations
for stellar mass values ranging from 1.06 to 1.30 Mo with a step of 0.02 Mo and
effective temperatures from 150000 K to approx. 5,000 K. A novel aspect
predicted by our calculations is that the mass-radius relation for the most
massive white dwarfs exhibits a marked dependence on the neutrino luminosity.
Extensive tabulations for massive white dwarfs, accessible from our web site,
are presented as well.",2005-07-25T19:30:58Z
"Spiral galaxies with a central plateau in the gas velocity curve along
  the major axis","We present the minor-axis kinematics of ionized gas and stars for a sample of
5 spiral galaxies, which are characterized by either a zero or a shallow gas
velocity gradient along their major axis. The asymmetric velocity profiles
observed along the minor axis of NGC 4064 and NGC 4189 can be explained as due
to the presence of a bar. This is also the case of NGC 4178 where the innermost
portion of the gaseous disk is nearly face on. In NGC 4424 and NGC 4941, we
measured non-zero gas velocities only in the central regions along the minor
axis and gas velocities drop to zero at larger radii. This kinematic feature is
suggestive of the presence of an orthogonally-rotating gaseous component which
is confined in the innermost regions (i.e. an inner polar disk) to be confirmed
with integral-field spectroscopy.",2005-05-19T13:46:18Z
Cosmological nonlinear hydrodynamics with post-Newtonian corrections,"The post-Newtonian (PN) approximation, based on the assumptions of weak
gravitational fields and slow motions, provides a way to estimate general
relativistic effects in the fully nonlinear evolution stage of the large-scale
cosmic structures. We extend Chandrasekhar's first order PN (1PN) hydrodynamics
based on the Minkowski background to the Robertson-Walker background. We assume
the presence of Friedmann's cosmological spacetime as a background. In the
background we include the three-space curvature, the cosmological constant and
general pressure. In the Newtonian order and 1PN order we include general
pressure, stress, and flux. The Newtonian hydrodynamic equations appear
naturally in the 0PN order. The spatial gauge degree of freedom is fixed in a
unique manner and the basic equations are arranged without taking the temporal
gauge condition. In this way we can conveniently try alternative temporal gauge
conditions. We investigate a number of temporal gauge conditions under which
all the remaining variables are equivalently gauge-invariant. Our aim is to
present the fully nonlinear 1PN equations in a form suitable for implementation
in conventional Newtonian hydrodynamic simulations with minimal extensions. The
1PN terms can be considered as relativistic corrections added to the well known
Newtonian equations. The proper arrangement of the variables and equations in
combination with suitable gauge conditions would allow the possible future 1PN
cosmological simulations to become more tractable. Our equations and gauges are
arranged for that purpose. We suggest ways of controlling the numerical
accuracy. The typical 1PN order terms are about $10^{-6} \sim 10^{-4}$ times
smaller than the Newtonian terms.",2005-07-05T00:57:21Z
Growth of perturbations in dark matter coupled with quintessence,"We consider the evolution of linear perturbations in models with a nonminimal
coupling between dark matter and scalar field dark energy. Growth of matter
inhomogeneities in two examples of such models proposed in the literature are
investigated in detail. Both of these models are based on a low-energy limit of
effective string theory action, and have been previously shown to naturally
lead to late acceleration of the universe. However, we find that these models
can be ruled out by taking properly into account the impact of the scalar field
coupling on the formation of structure in the dark matter density. In
particular, when the transition to acceleration in these models begins, the
interaction with dark energy enchances the small scale clustering in dark
matter much too strongly. We discuss the the role of an effective small scale
sound speed in such models with a coupled dark sector.",2005-04-26T10:59:49Z
"Gamma-ray bursts as dark energy-matter probes in the context of the
  generalized Chaplygin gas model","In this paper we consider the use of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) as distance
markers to study the unification of dark energy and dark matter in the context
of the so-called Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model. We consider that the
GRB luminosity may be estimated from its variability, time-lag, and also use
the so-called Ghirlanda relation. We evaluate the improvements one may expect
once more GRBs and their redshift become available. We show that although GRBs
allow for extending the Hubble diagram to higher redshifts, its use as a dark
energy probe is limited when compared to SNe Ia. We find that the information
from GRBs can provide some bounds on the amount of dark matter and dark energy
independently of the equation of state. This is particularly evident for
XCDM-type models, which are, for low-redshifts ($z\leq2$), degenerate with the
GCG.",2005-07-08T00:47:31Z
"Fe XI emission lines in a high resolution extreme ultraviolet spectrum
  obtained by SERTS","New calculations of radiative rates and electron impact excitation cross
sections for Fe XI are used to derive emission line intensity ratios involving
3s^23p^4 - 3s^23p^33d transitions in the 180-223 A wavelength range. These
ratios are subsequently compared with observations of a solar active region,
obtained during the 1995 flight Solar EUV Research Telescope and Spectrograph
(SERTS). The version of SERTS flown in 1995 incorporated a multilayer grating
that enhanced the instrumental sensitivity for features in the 170 - 225 A
wavelength range, observed in second-order between 340 and 450 A. This
enhancement led to the detection of many emission lines not seen on previous
SERTS flights, which were measured with the highest spectral resolution (0.03
A) ever achieved for spatially resolved active region spectra in this
wavelength range. However, even at this high spectral resolution, several of
the Fe XI lines are found to be blended, although the sources of the blends are
identified in the majority of cases. The most useful Fe XI electron density
diagnostic line intensity ratio is I(184.80 A)/I(188.21 A). This ratio involves
lines close in wavelength and free from blends, and which varies by a factor of
11.7 between N_e = 10^9 and 10^11 cm^-3, yet shows little temperature
sensitivity. An unknown line in the SERTS spectrum at 189.00 A is found to be
due to Fe XI, the first time (to our knowledge) this feature has been
identified in the solar spectrum. Similarly, there are new identifications of
the Fe XI 192.88, 198.56 and 202.42 A features, although the latter two are
blended with S VIII/Fe XII and Fe XIII, respectively.",2005-04-05T11:57:55Z
"VLT K-band spectroscopy of massive stars deeply embedded in IRAS sources
  with UCHII colours","We have obtained high resolution (R = 10,000) K-band spectra of candidate
young massive stars deeply embedded in (ultra-) compact HII regions (UCHIIs).
In these clusters, three types of objects are identified. The first type (38
objects) consists of ``naked'' OB stars whose K-band spectra are dominated by
photospheric emission. We classify the K-band spectra of the OB-type cluster
members using near-infrared classification criteria. The spectral
classification provides an important constraint on the distance to the embedded
cluster. The ionising power of the population thus derived is compared to the
information obtained from the infrared and radio flux of these sources. In most
cases these two different determinations of the ionising flux are consistent,
from which we conclude that we have identified the ionising star(s) in about
50% of the embedded clusters. The second type (7 objects) are point sources
associated with UCHII radio emission, that exhibit nebular emission lines in
the near-infrared. Six of the objects in this group produce HeI emission
indicative of an embedded O-type star. These objects are more embedded than the
OB stars and probably do not dominate the infrared flux as measured by IRAS.
The third type (20 objects) is characterised by broad (100--200 km/s) Brgamma
emission and no photospheric absorption profiles. Bik et al (2005) show that
these objects are massive YSO candidates surrounded by dense circumstellar
disks.",2005-05-13T18:03:55Z
The Magnetic Structure of Coronal Loops Observed by TRACE,"Previous studies have found that coronal loops have a nearly uniform
thickness, which seems to disagree with the characteristic expansion of active
region magnetic fields. This is one of the most intriguing enigmas in solar
physics. We here report on the first comprehensive one-to-one comparison of
observed loops with corresponding magnetic flux tubes obtained from cotemporal
magnetic field extrapolation models. We use EUV images from TRACE, magnetograms
from the MDI instrument on SOHO, and linear force-free field extrapolations.
For each loop, we find the particular value of the force-free parameter (alpha)
that best matches the observed loop axis and then construct flux tubes using
different assumed cross sections at one footpoint (circle and ellipses with
different orientations). We find that the flux tubes expand with height by
typically twice as much as the corresponding loops. We also find that many flux
tubes are much wider at one footpoint than the other, whereas the corresponding
loops are far more symmetric. It is clear that the actual coronal magnetic
field is more complex than the models we have considered. We suggest that the
observed symmetry of loops is related to the tangling of elemental magnetic
flux strands produced by photospheric convection.",2005-07-19T21:40:54Z
"High resolution spectroscopy of bright subdwarf B stars - I. Radial
  velocity variables","Radial velocity curves for 15 bright subdwarf B binary systems have been
measured using high precision radial velocity measurements from high S/N
optical high-resolution spectra. In addition, two bright sdB stars are
discovered to be radial velocity variable but the period could not yet be
determined. The companions for all systems are unseen. The periods range from
about 0.18 days up to more than ten days. The radial velocity semi amplitudes
are found to lie between 15 and 130 km/s. Using the mass functions, the masses
of the unseen companions have been constrained to lower limits of 0.03 up to
0.55 M_sun, and most probable values of 0.03 up to 0.81 M_sun. The invisible
companions for three of our program stars are undoubtedly white dwarfs. In the
other cases they could be either white dwarfs or main sequence stars. For two
stars the secondaries could possibly be brown dwarfs. As expected, the orbits
are circular for most of the systems. However, for one third of the program
stars we find slightly eccentric orbits with small eccentricities of
e~0.02-0.06. This is the first time that non-circular orbits have been found in
sdB binaries. No correlation with the orbital period can be found.",2005-07-01T12:43:45Z
"The Araucaria Project. Near-Infrared Photometry of Cepheid Variables in
  the Sculptor Galaxy NGC 300","We have obtained deep near-infrared images in J and K filters of three fields
in the Sculptor galaxy NGC 300 with the ESO VLT and ISAAC camera. For 16
Cepheid variables in these fields, we have determined J and K magnitudes at two
different epochs, and have derived their mean magnitudes in these bands. The
slopes of the resulting period-luminosity relations are in very good agreement
with the slopes of these relations measured in the LMC by Persson et al.
Fitting the LMC slopes to our data, we have derived distance moduli in J and K.
Using these values together with the values derived in the optical V and I
bands in our previous work, we have determined an improved total reddening for
NGC 300 of E(B-V)=0.096 +/- 0.006 mag, which yields extremely consistent values
for the absorption-corrected distance modulus of the galaxy from VIJK bands.
Our distance result for NGC 300 from this combined optical/near infrared
Cepheid study is (m-M)_0 = 26.37 +/- 0.04 (random) +/- 0.03 (systematic) mag
and is tied to an adopted true LMC distance modulus of 18.50 mag. Both random
and systematic uncertainties are dominated by photometric errors, while errors
due to reddening, metallicity effects and crowding are less important. Our
distance determination is consistent with the earlier result from near-infrared
(H-band) photometry of two Cepheids in NGC 300 by Madore et al., but far more
accurate. Our distance value also agrees with the HST Key Project result of
Freedman et al., and with the recent distance estimate for NGC 300 from Butler
et al. from the TRGB I-band magnitude when our improved reddening is used to
calculate the absorption corrections. Our distance results from the different
optical and near-infrared bands indicate that the reddening law in NGC 300 must
be very similar to the Galactic one.",2005-03-29T19:35:45Z
"High Resolution Spectroscopy of X-ray Quasars: Searching for the X-ray
  Absorption from the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium","We present a survey of six low to moderate redshift quasars with Chandra and
XMM-Newton. The primary goal is to search for the narrow X-ray absorption lines
produced by highly ionized metals in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium. All the
X-ray spectra can be fitted by a power law with neutral hydrogen absorption
method. The residuals that may caused by additional emission mechanisms or
calibration uncertainties are taken account by polynomial in order to search
for narrow absorption features. No real absorption line is detected at above
3-sigma level in all the spectra. We discuss the implications of the lack of
absorption lines for our understanding of the baryon content of the universe
and metallicity of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We find that the
non-detection of X-ray absorption lines indicates that the metal abundance of
the IGM should be smaller than ~0.3 solar abundance. We also discuss
implications of the non-detection of any local (z ~ 0) X-ray absorption
associated with the ISM, Galactic halo or local group, such as has been seen
along several other lines of sight (LOS). By comparing a pair of LOSs we
estimate a lower limit on the hydrogen number density for the (z ~ 0) 3C 273
absorber of n_H >= 4e-3 cm^-3.",2005-06-06T22:53:25Z
"A high angular-resolution search for the progenitor of the type Ic
  Supernova 2004gt","We report the results of a high-spatial-resoltion search for the progenitor
of type Ic supernova SN 2004gt, using the newly commissioned Keck laser-guide
star adaptive optics system (LGSAO) along with archival Hubble Space Telescope
data. This is the deepest search yet performed for the progenitor of any type
Ib/c event in a wide wavelength range stretching from the far UV to the near
IR. We determine that the progenitor of SN 2004gt was most likely less luminous
than M_V=-5.5 and M_B=-6.5 magnitudes. The massive stars exploding as
hydrogen-deficient core-collapse supernovae (SNe) should have lost their outer
hydrogen envelopes prior to their explosion, either through winds -- such stars
are identified within our Galaxy as Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars -- or to a binary
companion. The luminosity limits we set rule out more than half of the known
galactic W-R stars as possible progenitors of this event. In particular, they
imply that a W-R progenitor should have been among the more-evolved (highly
stripped, less luminous) of these stars, a concrete constraint on its
evolutionary state just prior to core collapse. The possibility of a less
luminous, lower-mass binary progenitor cannot be constrained. This study
demonstrates the power of LGS observations in furthering our understanding of
core collapse, and the physics powering supernovae, GRBs and XRFs.",2005-06-21T19:54:14Z
"Extremely Luminous Water Vapor Emission from a Type 2 Quasar at Redshift
  z = 0.66","A search for water masers in 47 Sloan Digital Sky Survey Type 2 quasars using
the Green Bank Telescope has yielded a detection at a redshift of z = 0.660.
This maser is more than an order of magnitude higher in redshift than any
previously known and, with a total isotropic luminosity of 23,000 L_sun, also
the most powerful. The presence and detectability of water masers in quasars at
z ~ 0.3-0.8 may provide a better understanding of quasar molecular tori and
disks, as well as fundamental quasar and galaxy properties such as black hole
masses. Water masers at cosmologically interesting distances may also
eventually provide, via direct distance determinations, a new cosmological
observable for testing the reality and properties of dark energy, currently
inferred primarily through Type 1a supernova measurements.",2005-06-10T19:33:38Z
Heavy Element Production in Inhomogeneous Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,"We present a new astrophysical site of the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)
that are very peculiar compared with the standard BBN. Some models of the
baryogenesis suggest that very high baryon density regions were formed in the
early universe. On the other hand, recent observations suggest that heavy
elements already exist in high red-shifts and the origin of these elements
become a big puzzle. Motivated by these, we investigate BBN in very high baryon
density regions. BBN proceeds in proton-rich environment, which is known to be
like the p-process. However, by taking very heavy nuclei into account, we find
that BBN proceeds through both the p-process and the r-process simultaneously.
P-nuclei such as 92Mo, 94Mo, 96Ru, 98Ru whose origin is not well known are also
synthesized.",2005-07-19T15:24:40Z
"Baikal neutrino telescope NT200+ : Upgrade of data acquisition and time
  calibration systems","The Baikal neutrino telescope NT200, operating since 1998, has been upgraded
in spring 2005 to NT200+. This telescope with 3 additional outer strings at 100
m radius from the center encloses a geometric volume of 5 Mtons. We describe
the modernized data acquisition and control system, which allows for higher
bandwidth, full multiplexing of data and control streams over a single cable to
shore, redundant system components and underwater data pre-processing. To
calibrate all time offsets between new distant strings and the central

laser and a light diffusor, has been developed. This laser is also used to tune
reconstruction techniques for pointlike showers with energies from 20 TeV to 10

Gravitational Lensing of Distant Supernovae,"We use a series of ray-tracing experiments to determine the magnification
distribution of high-redshift sources by gravitational lensing. We determine
empirically the relation between magnification and redshift, for various
cosmological models. We then use this relation to estimate the effect of
lensing on the determination of the cosmological parameters from observations
of high-z supernovae. We found that, for supernovae at redshifts z<1.8, the
effect of lensing is negligible compared to the intrinsic uncertainty in the
measurements. Using mock data in the range 1.8<z<8, we show that the effect of
lensing can become significant. Hence, if a population of very-high-z
supernovae was ever discovered, it would be crucial to fully understand the
effect of lensing, before these SNe could be used to constrain cosmological
models.",2005-03-21T16:46:08Z
Test-Particle Diffusive Shock Acceleration in Relativistic Shocks,"We present results from a fully relativistic Monte Carlo simulation of
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in unmodified (i.e., test-particle) shocks.
The computer code uses a single algorithmic sequence to smoothly span the range
from nonrelativistic speeds to fully relativistic shocks of arbitrary
obliquity, providing a powerful consistency check. We show the dependence of
the particle spectrum, which can differ strongly from the canonical f(p)
proportional to p^{-4.23} result, on the obliquity and on the strength and
``fineness'' of scattering for a range of shock Lorentz factors. The Monte
Carlo results are also shown to be consistent with a simple relation for the
spectral index given by Keshet and Waxman (2005) in parallel shocks when the
diffusion is ``fine'' and isotropic.",2005-07-05T18:43:08Z
The rates of Type Ia Supernovae. I. Analytical Formulations,"This paper provides a handy tool to compute the impact of Type Ia Supernova
(SNIa) on the evolution of stellar systems. An effective formalism is presented
to couple the SNIa rate to the star formation history, which rests upon the
definition of two key properties of the progenitor's model: the realization
probability of the SNIa event from a single stellar generation and the
distribution function of the delay times. It is shown that the current SNIa
rate in late type galaxies implies that the realization probability is on the
order of 0.001. Analytical formulations for the distribution function of the
delay times for Single (SD) and Double Degenerate (DD) progenitors are derived,
based on stellar evolution arguments. These formulations, which agree well with
the results of Monte Carlo simulations for the evolution of close binaries,
have a built in parametrization of the key properties of the alternative
candidates. The various models for the progenitors have different impact on the
large scales. In particular, the paper examines the systematic trend of the
SNIa rate per unit mass with the color of the parent galaxy, and shows that the
recent observations favor the DD model. The SD scenario can reproduce the data
only if the distribution of the primordial mass ratios is flat, and the
accretion efficiency onto the WD is close to 100%. The timescale for the Fe
release from SNIa to the interstellar medium ranges between 0.3 and 3 Gyr for a
wide variety of hypothesis on the SNIa progenitors. (ABRIDGED)",2005-04-18T07:43:21Z
Neural network correction of astrometric chromaticity,"In this paper we deal with the problem of chromaticity, i.e. apparent
position variation of stellar images with their spectral distribution, using
neural networks to analyse and process astronomical images. The goal is to
remove this relevant source of systematic error in the data reduction of high
precision astrometric experiments, like Gaia. This task can be accomplished
thanks to the capability of neural networks to solve a nonlinear approximation
problem, i.e. to construct an hypersurface that approximates a given set of
scattered data couples. Images are encoded associating each of them with
conveniently chosen moments, evaluated along the y axis. The technique
proposed, in the current framework, reduces the initial chromaticity of few
milliarcseconds to values of few microarcseconds.",2005-07-22T15:49:15Z
On the potential of extrasolar planet transit surveys,"We analyse the respective benefits and drawbacks of ground-based and
space-based transit surveys for extrasolar planets. Based on simple but
realistic assumptions about the fraction of lower main sequence stars harboring
telluric and giant planets within the outer limit of the habitable zone, we
predict the harvests of fictitious surveys with three existing wide field
optical and near-IR cameras: the CFHT-Megacam, SUBARU-Suprime and VISTA-IR. An
additional promising instrument is considered, VISTA-Vis, currently under
development. The results are compared with the harvests predicted under exactly
the same assumptions, for the space missions COROT and KEPLER. We show that
ground-based wide field surveys may discover more giant planets than space
missions. However, space surveys seem to constitute the best strategy to search
for telluric planets. In this respect, the KEPLER mission appears 50 times more
efficient than any of the ground--based surveys considered here. KEPLER might
even discover telluric planets in the habitable zone of their host star.",2005-08-03T15:23:01Z
A Unique Dust Formation Episode in the SC-Type Star UY Cen,"We report the first detection of new dust formation in an SC star. The
prototype of the SC stars, UY Cen, underwent a decline of 2 magnitudes in the
V-band. The SC stars show pulsational variations and have 60 micron excesses
indicating past dust formation. It has been suggested that as a star evolves
from oxygen rich to carbon rich, there is a short period of time when C/O$~1
that the star appears spectroscopically as an SC star and ceases to produce
dust. The SC star, BH Cru, has shown large spectroscopic and pulsation period
variations in only 30 years, indicating rapid evolution but it has shown no
sign of new dust formation. UY Cen has not shown any pulsation or spectroscopic
variations accompanying the onset of its dust formation. In addition, UY Cen
did not show emission in the resonance lines of Na I, K I or Rb I when it was
at its faintest, although these lines were a feature of the carbon stars R Lep
and V Hya during similar faint phases.",2005-06-21T19:07:13Z
New Jupiter and Saturn formation models meet observations,"The wealth of observational data about Jupiter and Saturn provides strong
constraints to guide our understanding of the formation of giant planets. The
size of the core and the total amount of heavy elements in the envelope have
been derived from internal structure studies by Saumon & Guillot (2004). The
atmospheric abundance of some volatile elements has been measured {\it in situ}
by the {\it Galileo} probe (Mahaffy et al. 2000, Wong et al. 2004) or by remote
sensing (Briggs & Sackett 1989, Kerola et al. 1997). In this Letter, we show
that, by extending the standard core accretion formation scenario of giant
planets by Pollack et al. (1996) to include migration and protoplanetary disk
evolution, it is possible to account for all of these constraints in a
self-consistent manner.",2005-04-27T12:16:13Z
"Statistical Mechanics of the self-gravitating gas: thermodynamic limit,
  phase diagrams and fractal structures","We provide a complete picture to the self-gravitating non-relativistic gas at
thermal equilibrium using Monte Carlo simulations, analytic mean field methods
(MF) and low density expansions. The system is shown to possess an infinite
volume limit in the grand canonical (GCE), canonical (CE) and microcanonical
(MCE) ensembles when (N, V) -> infty, keeping N/V^{1/3} fixed. We compute the
equation of state (we do not assume it as is customary in hydrodynamics), as
well as the energy, free energy, entropy, chemical potential, specific heats,
compressibilities and speed of sound; we analyze their properties, signs and
singularities. All physical quantities turn out to depend on a single variable
eta = G m^2 N /[V^{1/3} T} that is kept fixed in the N -> infty and V -> infty
limit. The system is in a gaseous phase for eta < eta_T and collapses into a
dense object for eta > eta_T in the CE with the pressure becoming large and
negative. At eta \simeq eta_T the isothermal compressibility diverges and the
gas collapses. Our Monte Carlo simulations yield eta_T \simeq 1.515. We find
that PV/[NT] = f(eta). The function f(eta) has a second Riemann sheet which is
only physically realized in the MCE. In the MCE, the collapse phase transition
takes place in this second sheet near eta_{MC} = 1.26 and the pressure and
temperature are larger in the collapsed phase than in the gaseous phase. Both
collapse phase transitions (in the CE and in the MCE) are of zeroth order since
the Gibbs free energy has a jump at the transitions.",2005-05-27T17:01:22Z
"HS0139+0559, HS0229+8016, HS0506+7725 and HS0642+5049: Four new
  long-period cataclysmic variables","We present time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry of four
relatively bright (V~14.0-15.5) long-period cataclysmic variables (CVs)
discovered in the Hamburg Quasar Survey: HS0139+0559, HS0229+8016, HS0506+7725
and HS0642+5049. Their respective orbital periods, 243.69+-0.49min,
232.550+-0.049min, 212.7+-0.2min and 225.90+-0.23min are determined from radial
velocity and photometric variability studies. HS0506+7725 is characterised by
strong Balmer and He emission lines, short-period (~10-20min) flickering and
weak X-ray emission in the ROSAT All Sky Survey. The detection of a deep low
state (~18.5) identifies HS0506+7725 as a member of the VY Scl stars.
HS0139+0559, HS0229+8016 and HS0642+5049 display thick-disc like spectra and no
or only weak flickering activity. HS0139+0559 and HS0229+8016 exhibit clean
quasi-sinusoidal radial velocity varations of their emission lines but no or
very little orbital photometric variability. In contrast, we detect no radial
velocity variation in HS0642+5049 but a noticeable orbital brightness
variation. We identify all three systems either as UX UMa-type novalike
variables or as Z Cam-type dwarf novae. Our identification of these four new
systems underlines that the currently known sample of CVs is rather incomplete
even for bright objects. The four new systems add to the clustering of orbital
periods in the 3-4h range found in the sample of HQS selected CVs, and we
discuss the large incidence of magnetic CVs and VY Scl/SW Sex stars found in
this period range among the known population of CVs.",2005-07-14T09:46:00Z
"The many lives of active galactic nuclei: cooling flows, black holes and
  the luminosities and colours of galaxies","We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes
by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium
Run, a very large simulation of the concordance LCDM cosmogony. Our procedures
follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the
evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud
throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In
this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity
of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those AGN
that lie at the centre of a quasistatic X-ray emitting atmosphere in a galaxy
group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible
parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass
drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end
of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive
galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain
systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs
because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and
radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback)
can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star
formation. We discuss possible physical models which might explain the
accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to
be successful.",2005-08-02T13:20:59Z
"X-ray absorption and re-emission from an ionised outflow in the Type 1
  QSO 2MASS 234449+1221","We report on the analysis of a short XMM-Newton observation of the reddened
Type 1 QSO 2MASS 234449+1221 first identified in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey.
The underlying X-ray continuum is found to be typical of a broad-line active
galaxy, with photon index Gamma ~ 1.9. Low energy absorption can be modelled by
a column N_H ~ 10^22 cm^{-2} of moderately ionised gas or a smaller column of
cold gas. Addition of a soft X-ray emission component significantly improves
the fit in both cases. With the assumption that the soft X-ray flux represents
emission from gas photoionised by the incident X-ray continuum, a comparison of
the absorbed and emitted luminosities indicates a covering factor of ~ 8-17%.
The unusual opportunity to simultaneously observe and quantify ionised
absorption and emission in 2MASS 234449+1221 is due to the relatively large
opacity (for a Type 1 AGN) of the absorbing gas, which depresses the normally
strong continuum below ~ 1 keV. A comparison of the soft X-ray emission of
2MASS 234449+1221 with that of other Type 1 and Type 2 AGN suggests the
existence of an inner turbulent extension to ionised outflows, not detected in
current high resolution X-ray spectra.",2005-06-29T15:09:36Z
Using ACT arrays as Intensity Interferometers,"The Narrabri intensity interferometer was successfully used until 1974 to
observe 32 stars, all brighter than B=+2.5, among which some were found to have
an angular diameter as small as 0.41+/-0.03 milli-arc-seconds (mas). The
technique was then abandoned in favor of Michelson interferometry. Here we
consider the technical feasibility and scientific potential of implementing
intensity interferometry on Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope arrays. The
scientific motivations are varied, including stellar diameter measurements and
investigations of the circumstellar environment. Long baselines and short
wavelengths are easily accesible to this technique, making it uniquely suited
for some applications.",2005-07-01T00:43:19Z
"Self-regulated black hole accretion, the M-sigma relation, and the
  growth of bulges in galaxies","We argue that the velocity dispersions and masses of galactic bulges and
spheroids are byproducts of the feedback that regulates rapid black hole growth
in protogalaxies. We suggest that the feedback energy liberated by accretion
must pass through the accreting material, in an energy-conserving flux close-in
and a momentum-conserving flux further out. If the inflowing gas dominates the
gravitational potential outside the Bondi radius, feedback from
Eddington-limited accretion drives the density profile of the gas to that of a
singular isothermal sphere. We find that the velocity dispersion associated
with the isothermal potential, sigma, increases with time as the black hole
mass M grows, in such a way that M is proportional to sigma^4. The coefficient
of this proportionality depends on the radius at which the flow switches from
energy conserving to momentum conserving, and gives the observed M-sigma
relation if the transition occurs at ~100 Schwarzschild radii. We associate
this transition with radiative cooling and show that bremsstrahlung, strongly
boosted by inverse Compton scattering in a two-temperature (T_p >> T_e) plasma,
leads to a transition at the desired radius.
  According to this picture, bulge masses M_b are insensitive to the virial
masses of their dark matter haloes, but correlate linearly with black hole
mass. Our analytic model also explains the M_b-sigma (Faber-Jackson) relation
as a relic of black hole accretion. The model naturally explains why the
M-sigma relation has less scatter than either the M-M_b (Magorrian) or the
Faber-Jackson relation. It suggests that the M-sigma relation could extend down
to very low velocity dispersions, and predicts that the relation should not
evolve with redshift.",2005-04-18T21:23:19Z
Panchromatic Studies of Distant Clusters of Galaxies,"High redshift (z >~ 1) clusters are ideal probes to study the formation and
evolution of large scale structures and galaxies in the universe. A 10-m class
ground based telescope, X-ray observatories (Chandra, XMM-Newton) and HST/ACS
are allowing us to perform an unprecedented study of distant massive clusters
of galaxies in the redshift range 0.84<z<1.3, selected from X-rays surveys. In
this paper we summarize our results on the structure and dynamics of two of
these clusters derived from imaging and spectroscopic data as well as our
results on the evolution of early-type galaxies.",2005-08-02T15:59:08Z
The Impact of Hydrodynamic Mixing on Supernova Progenitors,"Recent multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated the
importance of hydrodynamic motions in the convective boundary and radiative
regions of stars to transport of energy, momentum, and composition. The impact
of these processes increases with stellar mass. Stellar models which
approximate this physics have been tested on several classes of observational
problems. In this paper we examine the implications of the improved treatment
on supernova progenitors. The improved models predict substantially different
interior structures. We present pre-supernova conditions and simple explosion
calculations from stellar models with and without the improved mixing treatment
at 23 solar masses. The results differ substantially.",2005-07-05T18:23:24Z
"Separating polarized cosmological and galactic emissions for CMB B-mode
  polarization experiments","In this work we study the relevance of the component separation technique
based on the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and investigate its
performance in the context of a limited sky coverage observation and from the
viewpoint of our ability to differentiate between cosmological models with
different primordial B-mode content. We focus on the low Galactic emission sky
patch, corresponding to the target of several operating and planned CMB
experiments and which, in many respects, adequately represents a typical
""clean"" high latitude sky. We consider two fiducial observations, one operating
at low (40, 90 GHz) and one at high (150, 350 GHz) frequencies and thus
dominated by the synchrotron and thermal dust emission, respectively. We use a
parallel version of the FASTICA code to explore a substantial parameter space
including Gaussian pixel noise level, observed sky area and the amplitude of
the foreground emission and employ large Monte Carlo simulations to quantify
errors and biases pertinent to the reconstruction for different choices of the
parameter values. We identify a large subspace of the parameter space for which
the quality of the CMB reconstruction is excellent. For both the cosmological
models, with and without the primordial gravitational waves, we find that
FASTICA performs extremely well even in the cases when the B mode CMB signal is
up to a few times weaker than the foreground contamination and the noise
amplitude is comparable with the total CMB polarized emission. In addition we
discuss limiting cases of the noise and foreground amplitudes, for which the
ICA approach fails.",2005-05-18T14:53:05Z
Prospects for Dark Energy Evolution: a Frequentist Multi-Probe Approach,"A major quest in cosmology is the understanding of the nature of dark energy.
It is now well known that a combination of cosmological probes is required to
break the underlying degeneracies on cosmological parameters. In this paper, we
present a method, based on a frequentist approach, to combine probes without
any prior constraints, taking full account of the correlations in the
parameters. As an application, a combination of current SNIa and CMB data with
an evolving dark energy component is first compared to other analyses. We
emphasise the consequences of the implementation of the dark energy
perturbations on the result for a time varying equation of state. The impact of
future weak lensing surveys on the measurement of dark energy evolution is then
studied in combination with future measurements of the cosmic microwave
background and type Ia supernovae. We present the combined results for future
mid-term and long-term surveys and confirm that the combination with weak
lensing is very powerful in breaking parameter degeneracies. A second
generation of experiment is however required to achieve a 0.1 error on the
parameters describing the evolution of dark energy.",2005-07-07T14:39:25Z
"Far-Infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of Embedded Protostars and
  Dusty Galaxies: I. Theory for Spherical Sources","We present analytic radiative transfer solutions for the spectra of
unresolved, spherically symmetric, centrally heated, dusty sources. We find
that the dust thermal spectrum possesses scaling relations that provide a
natural classification for a broad range of sources, from low-mass protostars
to dusty galaxies. In particular, we find that, given our assumptions, spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) can be characterized by two distance-independent
parameters, the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M$, and the surface density,
$\Sigma$, for a set of two functions, namely, the density profile and the
opacity curve. The goal is to use SEDs as a diagnostic tool in inferring the
large-scale physical conditions in protostellar and extragalactic sources, and
ultimately, evolutionary parameters. Our approach obviates the need to use SED
templates in the millimeter to far-infrared region of the spectrum; this is a
common practice in the extragalactic community that relies on observed
correlations established at low redshift that may not necessarily extend to
high redshift. Further, we demarcate the limited region of parameter space in
which density profiles can be inferred from the SED, which is of particular
import in the protostellar community as competing theories of star formation
are characterized by different density profiles. The functionality of our model
is unique in that in provides for a self-consistent analytic solution that we
have validated by comparison with a well-tested radiative transfer code (DUSTY)
to find excellent agreement with numerical results over a parameter space that
spans low-mass protostars to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGS).",2005-06-27T19:49:33Z
Formation and evolution of primordial black holes after hybrid inflation,"We examine the formation and evolution of primordial black holes (PBH's)
after hybrid inflation. Our goal is to assess the effects of various
theoretical uncertainties on the extrapolation from a given inflation model to
a spectrum of primordial black hole masses. The context of our work is an
examination of the possibility [Chen and Adler (2003), MacGibbon (1987)] that
the dark matter is comprised of Planck-mass black hole remnants (BHR's). As an
example we focus on a particular scenario [Chen (2003)] in which the black
holes form from quantum perturbations that were generated during hybrid
inflation. We find the correspondence between hybrid inflation parameters and
the range of initial PBH masses that would allow BHR's to comprise the dark
matter, taking account of the possible early presence of radiation and its
accretion onto the PBH's.",2005-04-27T18:27:27Z
"Aten-Alinda orbital evolution: the example of possible interacting
  orbits","Minor planets 887 Alinda and 2062 Aten are typical near Earth asteroids
(NEA). Our previous researches show their possible origin in catastrophic
collision near Earth orbit. It is determine the target of present research --
to investigate interactions between these objects in more details. Orbits m.p.
887 and 2062 are crossed near pericenter and apocenter accordingly. So possible
interval of the interaction of these objects is repeated through the
significant time interval and has relatively small duration. On the strength of
several reasons, orbits of fragments of the disastrous collision can have no an
exact intersection. Besides, when integrating on the greater gap in the past
increases a role of the uncertainty of initial values of elements of orbits.
These factors determine a probabilistic nature of the result as well as need of
modeling of the disastrous process. However, on the strength of the specific
spatial location of orbits, result has highly determined numeric expression -
in the suggestion on the possible interaction m. p. 887 and 2062, this event
has occurred about 1400 years ago. The possible participation some other near
Earth minor objects, include Quadrantides meteoric stream, in described
disastrous event is discussed.",2005-05-16T10:03:41Z
"HST/ACS observations of the old and metal-poor Sagittarius dwarf
  irregular galaxy","We have obtained deep color-magnitude diagrams of the Sagittarius dwarf
irregular galaxy with the HST/ACS. The new diagrams unveil for the first time
the star formation history of SagDIG.
  We identify a small population of red horizontal branch stars, which sets the
first epoch of star formation in SagDIG back to ~9-10 Gyr ago. This shows that
SagDIG has been able to maintain a very low mean metallicity (-2.2<[Fe/H]<-1.9)
over a 10 Gyr life time, and most importantly, that all Local Group dwarf
galaxies share an ancient (~10 Gyr) initial episode of star formation. Thus, at
the moment, IZw18 remains the only exception to this general trend, favoring
the so-called ``young galaxy'' scenario. However, a re-analysis of ACS
observations of IZw18 suggests that an older RGB population may be present also
in IZw18.
  We also compare the distribution of atomic hydrogen with that of stellar
populations of various ages. We find little correlation between stellar
populations older than ~1 Gyr and the HI. In particular we fail to find any
generation of stars that preferentially lie within the large HI hole. We
therefore exclude the possibility that the SagDIG ring-like HI distribution is
the result of multiple supernova events. Alternative scenarios have to be
explored.",2005-05-19T09:53:43Z
A solar active region loop compared with a 2D MHD model,"We analyzed a coronal loop observed with the Normal Incidence Spectrometer
(NIS), which is part of the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on board the
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The measured Doppler shifts and
proper motions along the selected loop strongly indicate unidirectional flows.
Analysing the Emission Measure Curves of the observed spectral lines, we
estimated that the temperature along the loop was about 380000 K. We adapted a
solution of the ideal MHD steady equations to our set of measurements. The
derived energy balance along the loop, as well as the advantages/disadvantages
of this MHD model for understanding the characteristics of solar coronal loops
are discussed.",2005-03-31T13:35:04Z
"An asteroseismic study of the Beta Cephei star Theta Ophiuchi:
  spectroscopic results","We present the results of a detailed analysis of 121 ground-based
high-resolution high S/N spectroscopic measurements spread over 3 years for the
Beta Cephei star Theta Ophiuchi. We discovered Theta Oph to be a triple system.
In addition to the already known Speckle B5 companion of the B2 primary, we
showed the presence of a low-mass spectroscopic companion and we derived an
orbital period of 56.71 days with an eccentricity of 0.1670. After removing the
orbit we determined two frequencies for the primary in the residual radial
velocities: f1 = 7.1160 c/d and f2 = 7.4676 c/d. We also found the presence of
f3 = 7.3696 c/d by means of a two dimensional frequency search across the Si
III 4567 A profiles. We identified the m-value of the main mode with frequency
f1 by taking into account the photometric identifications of the degrees l. By
means of the moment method and the amplitude and phase variations across the
line profile, we derived (l1,m1) = (2,-1). This result allows us to fix the
mode identifications of the whole quintuplet for which three components were
detected in photometry. This is of particular use for our forthcoming seismic
modelling of the primary. We also determined stellar parameters of the primary
by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium hydrogen, helium and silicon line
profile fitting and we obtained Teff = 24000 K and log g = 4.1, which is
consistent with photometrically determined values.",2005-06-27T13:26:59Z
"The Dark Halo of NGC 5963 as a Constraint on Dark Matter
  Self-Interaction at the Low Velocity Regime","Self-interacting dark matter has been proposed as a hypothesis to explain the
shallow central slopes of the density profiles of dark matter halos in
galaxies. In order to be consistent with observational studies at scales of
galaxy clusters, the cross section should scale inversely with the velocity of
collision. In this paper we consider the mass density profile of the halo of
the low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy NGC 5963 to place an upper limit on the
dark matter cross section for collisions with velocities $\sim 150$ km
s$^{-1}$, i.e. at the low velocity regime. After calibrating against
cosmological simulations, we found that the large inferred dark matter
concentration and central dark matter density in NGC 5963 are inconsistent with
an effective collisional cross section per unit of mass >0.2 cm^2/g.
Corrections were applied in order to account for reduction of the core by the
adiabatic contraction caused by cooling baryons. Our limits that involve a
number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions, exclude the last
permitted interval for velocity-dependent cross sections to explain the flat
density core in LSB galaxies. Implications for the nature of dark matter are
also discussed.",2005-06-15T14:54:10Z
"Characteristic QSO Accretion Disk Temperatures from Spectroscopic
  Continuum Variability","Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar spectra taken at multiple
epochs, we find that the composite flux density differences in the rest frame
wavelength range 1300-6000 AA can be fit by a standard thermal accretion disk
model where the accretion rate has changed from one epoch to the next (without
considering additional continuum emission components). The fit to the composite
residual has two free parameters: a normalizing constant and the average
characteristic temperature $\bar{T}^*$. In turn the characteristic temperature
is dependent on the ratio of the mass accretion rate to the square of the black
hole mass. We therefore conclude that most of the UV/optical variability may be
due to processes involving the disk, and thus that a significant fraction of
the UV/optical spectrum may come directly from the disk.",2005-06-01T04:22:41Z
"Using transport coefficients of cosmic rays in turbulent magnetic fields
  to determine hybrid viscosity in hot accretion disks around AGN","The nature of the viscosity operative in hot, two-temperature accretion disks
around AGN has been a long-standing, unsolved problem. It has been previously
suggested that protons, in conjunction with the turbulent magnetic field that
is likely to exist in the accretion disk, might be crucial in providing this
viscosity. Several authors have recently determined diffusion coefficients for
charged particles (cosmic rays) propagating in turbulent magnetic fields by
means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We use the diffusion coefficients
for protons determined by these simulations to find the effective mean free
path for protons in hot accretion disks. This in turn yields good estimates of
the viscosity due to energetic protons embedded in the turbulent magnetic field
of a hot, two-temperature accretion disk. We combine this with a simple
two-temperature accretion disk model to determine the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$
viscosity parameter arising out of this mechanism. We find that protons
diffusing in the turbulent magentic field embedded in a hot accretion d isk
provide a physically reasonable source of viscosity in hot accretion disks
around AGN.",2005-07-10T06:57:30Z
"Upper Limits on the Extragalactic Background Light from the Gamma-Ray
  Spectra of Blazars","The direct measurement of the extragalactic background light (EBL) is
difficult at optical to infrared wavelengths because of the strong foreground
radiation originating in the Solar System. Very high energy (VHE, E$>$100 GeV)
gamma rays interact with EBL photons of these wavelengths through pair
production. In this work, the available VHE spectra from six blazars are used
to place upper limits on the EBL. These blazars have been detected over a range
of redshifts and a steepening of the spectral index is observed with increasing
source distance. This can be interpreted as absorption by the EBL. In general,
knowledge of the intrinsic source spectrum is necessary to determine the
density of the intervening EBL. Motivated by the observed spectral steepening
with redshift, upper limits on the EBL are derived by assuming that the
intrinsic spectra of the six blazars are $\propto E^{-1.8}$. Upper limits are
then placed on the EBL flux at discrete energies without assuming a specific
spectral shape for the EBL. This is an advantage over other methods since the
EBL spectrum is uncertain.",2005-04-18T19:37:34Z
A large HI cloud near the centre of the Virgo cluster,"We report the discovery of a large HI cloud in the central regions of the
Virgo cluster. It is 110 x 25 kpc in size and contains 3.4 x 10^8 Msol of HI.
The morphology and kinematics of this cloud strongly suggest that it consists
of HI removed from the galaxy NGC 4388 by ram-pressure stripping. It is more
likely the result of an interaction of the ISM of NGC 4388 with the hot halo of
the M86 group and not with the ICM centred on M87. The large extent of the
plume suggests that gas stripped from cluster galaxies can remain neutral for
at least 10^8 yr. Locally, the column density is well above 10^20 cm^-2,
suggesting that the intra-cluster HII regions known to exist in Virgo may have
formed from gas stripped from cluster galaxies. The existence of the HI plume
suggests that stripping of infalling spirals contributes to the enrichment of
the ICM. The HI object in the Virgo cluster recently reported by Minchin et al.
may have a similar origin and may therefore not be a ``dark galaxy''.",2005-05-19T07:58:26Z
"The supernova rate-velocity dispersion relation in the interstellar
  medium","We investigate the relationship between the velocity dispersion of the gas
and the SN rate and feedback efficiency in the ISM. We explore the constancy of
the velocity dispersion profiles in the outer parts of galactic disks at~6-8 km
s^-1, and the transition to the starburst regime. Our results show that a) SN
driving leads to constant velocity dispersions of sig~6 km s^-1 for the total
gas and sigHI~3 km s^-1 for the HI gas, independent of the SN rate, for values
of the rate between 0.01-0.5 the Galactic rate R_{G},b) the position of the
transition to the starburst regime at SFR/Area~5*10^-3-10^-2 M_sol yr^-1 kpc^-2
observed in the simulations, is in good agreement with the transition to the
starburst regime in the observations, c) for the high SN rates, no HI gas is
present in the simulations box, however, for the total gas velocity dispersion,
there is good agreement between the models and the observations,d) at the
intermediate SN rates R/R_{G}~0.5-1, taking into account the thermal broadening
of the HI line helps reach a good agreement in that regime between the models
and the observations,e) for R/R_{G}<0.5, sig and sigHI fall below the observed
values by a factor of~2. However, a set of simulation with different values of
epsilon indicates that for larger values of the supernova feedback
efficiencies, velocity dispersions of the HI gas of the order of 5-6 km s^{-1}
can be obtained, in closer agreement with the observations. The fact that for
R/R_{G}<0.5, the HI gas velocity dispersions are a factor ~2 smaller than the
observed values could result from the fact that we might have underestimated
the SN feedback efficiency. It might also be an indication that other physical
processes couple to the stellar feedback in order to produce the observed level
of turbulence in galactic disks.",2005-06-15T11:41:04Z
Neutrino Astronomy beyond and beneath the Horizons,"The Earth's Shadow to Cosmic Rays offer a windows to Tau Neutrino Astronomy
at the Horizon edges. Inclined and Horizontal C.R. Showers (70^o-90^o zenith
angle) produce secondary (gamma,e) mostly suppressed by high column atmosphere
depth. The shower Cherenkov photons are diluted and filtered by air opacity,
but secondary penetrating, muon pairs and their decay into electron pairs,
revive additional Cerenkov flash lights. Most largest GeVs gamma telescopes may
detect such UHECR horizontal showers. Arrival angle and column depth, shower
shape, timing may inform on the altitude interaction and on primary UHECR
composition. At larger zenith angle (90^o-99^o) more rare up-going showers are
traced by muon (as well electromagnetic) bundles that would give evidence of
rare Earth-Skimming neutrinos, tau and anti-tau neutrinos, at PeVs-EeVs
energies. Their rate may be comparable with 6.3 PeVs anti-neutrino electron
induced air-shower originated in interposed atmosphere, by W^- resonance at
Glashow peak. Additional and complementary UHE SUSY neutralino or staus may
blaze. Their nature might be disentangled by Stereoscopic Telescopes array.
Magic and Hess telescope in present set up may be already comparable to AMANDA
underground neutrino detector. Such telescopes pointing at the horizons toward
active sources (AGN,BL Lac Objects, GRBs or SGRs blazing micro-quasar jet, and
SNRs) do experience in those directions an air mass corresponding to a km^3
water one. Therefore Horizontal Showering is already the most sensitive windows
to Neutrino Astronomy possibly pointing to AGN,GRB or SGR events.",2005-05-21T16:26:26Z

"Could the 47 UMa Planetary System be a Second Solar System: predicting
  the Earth-like planets","(Abridged)We numerically investigated the dynamical architecture of 47 UMa
with the planetary configuration of the best-fit orbital solutions by Fischer
et al. We systematically studied the existence of Earth-like planets in the
region 0.05 AU $\leq a \leq 2.0$ AU for 47 UMa with numerical simulations, and
we also explored the packed planetary geometry and Trojan planets in the
system. In the simulations, we found that ""hot Earths"" at 0.05 AU $\leq a < $
0.4 AU can dynamically survive at least for 1 Myr. The Earth-like planets can
eventually remain in the system for 10 Myr in areas involved in the mean motion
resonances (MMR) (e.g., 3:2 MMR) with the inner companion. Moreover, we showed
that the 2:1 and 3:1 resonances are on the fringe of stability, while the 5:2
MMR is unstable. Additionally, the 2:1 MMR marks out a remarkable boundary
between chaotic and regular motions, inside, most of the orbits can survive,
outside, they are mostly lost in the orbital evolution. In a dynamical sense,
the most likely candidate for habitable environment is Earth-like planets with
orbits in the ranges 0.8 AU $\leq a < 1.0$ AU and 1.0 AU $ < a < 1.30$ AU
(except several unstable cases) with relatively low eccentricities. The Trojan
planets with low eccentricities and inclinations can secularly last at the
triangular equilibrium points of two massive planets. Hence, the 47 UMa
planetary system may be a close analog to our solar system.",2005-06-16T08:42:39Z
Tracing the Nature of Dark Energy with Galaxy Distribution,"Dynamical Dark Energy (DE) is a viable alternative to the cosmological
constant. Yet, constructing tests to discriminate between Lambda and dynamical
DE models is difficult because the differences are not large. In this paper we
explore tests based on the galaxy mass function, the void probability function
(VPF), and the number of galaxy clusters. At high z the number density of
clusters shows large differences between DE models, but geometrical factors
reduce the differences substantially. We find that detecting a model dependence
in the cluster redshift distribution is a hard challenge. We show that the
galaxy redshift distribution is potentially a more sensitive characteristics.
We do so by populating dark matter halos in Nbody simulations with galaxies
using well-tested Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD). We also estimate the Void
Probability Function and find that, in samples with the same angular surface
density of galaxies in different models, the VPF is almost model independent
and cannot be used as a test for DE. Once again, geometry and cosmic evolution
compensate each other. By comparing VPF's for samples with fixed galaxy mass
limits, we find measurable differences.",2005-04-05T20:00:06Z
Four new wide binaries among exoplanet host stars,"In our ongoing survey for wide (sub)stellar companions of exoplanet host
stars we have found 4 new co-moving stellar companions of the stars HD114729,
HD16141, HD196050 and HD213240 with projected separations from 223 up to
3898AU. The companionship of HD114729B, HD196050B and HD213240C is confirmed by
photometry and spectroscopy, all being early M dwarfs. The masses of the
detected companions are derived from their infrared JHK magnitudes and range
between 0.146 and 0.363 Msun. Our first and second epoch observations can rule
out additional stellar companions around the primaries from ~200 up to ~2400 AU
(S/N=10). In our survey we have found so far 6 new binaries among the exoplanet
host stars. According to these new detections, the reported differences between
single-star and binary-star planets with orbital periods short than 40 days
remain significant in both the mass-period and eccentricity-period
distribution. In contrast, all exoplanets with orbital periods longer than 100
days tend to display similar distributions.",2005-07-05T17:27:28Z
Encounters between spherical galaxies I: systems without dark halo,"We report here on a survey of N-body simulations of encounters between
spherical galaxies. Initial systems are isotropic Jaffe models. Different sets
of mass ratios, impact parameters and orbital energies are studied. Both merger
remnants and systems perturbed after a non-merging encounter are analysed and
compared to real-life elliptical galaxies. The properties of merger remnants
show a large variety. Merger remnants resulting from head-on encounters are
mainly non-rotating prolate spheroids. Merger remnants from models with angular
momentum different from zero are triaxial or mildly oblate spheroids supported
in part by rotation. The velocity distributions are biased towards the radial
direction in the prolate case and the tangential direction in the oblate case.
Non-mergers are affected in various ways, depending on the orbital
characteristics. We conclude that many of the global properties of real-life
ellipticals can in principle be attributed to a merger of spherical
progenitors.",2005-06-01T15:00:46Z

XMM-Newton observations of four millisecond pulsars,"I present an analysis of the XMM-Newton observations of four millisecond
pulsars, J0437-4715, J2124-3358, J1024-0719, and J0034-0534. The new data
provide strong evidence of thermal emission in the X-ray flux detected from the
first three objects. This thermal component is best interpreted as radiation
from pulsar polar caps covered with a nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere. A
nonthermal power-law component, dominating at energies E>3 keV, can also be
present in the detected X-ray emission. For PSR J0437-4715, the timing analysis
reveals that the shape and pulsed fraction of the pulsar light curves are
energy dependent. This, together with the results obtained from the
phase-resolved spectroscopy, supports the two-component (thermal plus
nonthermal) interpretation of the pulsar's X-ray radiation. Highly significant
pulsations have been found in the X-ray flux of PSRs J2124-3358 and J1024-0719.
For PSR J0034-0534, a possible X-ray counterpart of the radio pulsar has been
suggested. The inferred properties of the detected thermal emission are
compared with predictions of radio pulsar models.",2005-07-10T16:47:03Z
Evaluation of cosmic ray rejection algorithms on single-shot exposures,"To maximise data output from single-shot astronomical images, the rejection
of cosmic rays is important. We present the results of a benchmark trial
comparing various cosmic ray rejection algorithms. The procedures assess
relative performances and characteristics of the processes in cosmic ray
detection, rates of false detections of true objects and the quality of image
cleaning and reconstruction. The cosmic ray rejection algorithms developed by
Rhoads (2000), van Dokkum (2001), Pych (2004) and the IRAF task xzap by
Dickinson are tested using both simulated and real data. It is found that
detection efficiency is independent of the density of cosmic rays in an image,
being more strongly affected by the density of real objects in the field. As
expected, spurious detections and alterations to real data in the cleaning
process are also significantly increased by high object densities. We find the
Rhoads' linear filtering method to produce the best performance in detection of
cosmic ray events, however, the popular van Dokkum algorithm exhibits the
highest overall performance in terms of detection and cleaning.",2005-06-21T01:19:07Z
"Chemical Abundance Distributions of Galactic Halos and their Satellite
  Systems in a Lambda CDM Universe","We present a cosmologically motivated model for the hierachical formation of
the stellar halo which includes a semi-analytic treatment of galactic chemical
enrichment coupled to numerical simulations that track the orbital evolution
and tidal disruption of satellites. A major motivating factor in this
investigation is the observed systematic difference between the chemical
abundances of stars in satellite galaxies and those in the Milky Way halo.
Specifically, for the same [Fe/H] values, stars in neighboring satellite
galaxies display significantly lower [alpha/Fe] ratios than stars in the halo.
  We find that the observed chemical abundance patterns are a natural outcome
of the process of hierarchical assembly of the Galaxy. This result follows
because the stellar halo in this context is built up from satellite galaxies
accreted early on (more than 8-9 Gyr ago) and enriched in alpha-elements
produced in Type II supernovae. In contrast, satellites which survive today are
typically accreted late (within the last 4-5 Gyr) with nearly solar [alpha/Fe]
values as a result of contributions from both Type II and Type Ia supernovae.
We use our model to investigate the abundance distribution functions (using
both [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] ratios) for stars in the halo and in surviving
satellites. Our results suggest that the shapes and peaks in the abundance
distribution functions provide a direct probe of the accretion histories of
galaxies.",2005-07-05T22:00:44Z
The Near Infrared Background: Interplanetary Dust or Primordial Stars?,"The intensity of the diffuse ~ 1 - 4 micron sky emission from which solar
system and Galactic foregrounds have been subtracted is in excess of that
expected from energy released by galaxies and stars that formed during the z <
5 redshift interval (Arendt & Dwek 2003, Matsumoto et al. 2005). The spectral
signature of this excess near-infrared background light (NIRBL) component is
almost identical to that of reflected sunlight from the interplanetary dust
cloud, and could therefore be the result of the incomplete subtraction of this
foreground emission component from the diffuse sky maps. Alternatively, this
emission component could be extragalactic. Its spectral signature is consistent
with that of redshifted continuum and recombination line emission from HII
regions formed by the first generation of very massive stars. In this paper we
analyze the implications of this spectral component for the formation rate of
these Population III stars, the redshift interval during which they formed, the
reionization of the universe and evolution of collapsed halo masses. We find
that to reproduce the intensity and spectral shape of the NIRBL requires a peak
star formation rate that is higher by about a factor of 4 to 10 compared to
those derived from hierarchical models. Furthermore, an extragalactic origin
for the NIRBL leads to physically unrealistic absorption-corrected spectra of
distant TeV blazars. All these results suggest that Pop III stars contribute
only a fraction of the NIRBL intensity with zodiacal light, star forming
galaxies, and/or non-nuclear sources giving rise to the remaining fraction.",2005-08-11T18:23:06Z
Brightness constraint for cooling models of young neutron stars,"We study the systematics of neutron star cooling curves with three
representative masses from the most populated interval of the estimated mass
distribution for compact objects. The cooling simulations are made in the
framework of the nuclear medium cooling (NMC) scenario using different
combinations of possible nucleon-nucleon pairing gaps. Possible heating or
enhanced cooling mechanisms in the crust are not considered. We define a
constraint on the highest possible temperatures for a given age of young
neutron stars and show that this limits the freedom of modeling pairing gaps
and crust properties.",2005-07-02T23:16:30Z
"The NN2 Flux Difference Method for Constructing Variable Object Light
  Curves","We present a new method for optimally extracting point-source time
variability information from a series of images. Differential photometry is
generally best accomplished by subtracting two images separated in time, since
this removes all constant objects in the field. By removing background sources
such as the host galaxies of supernovae, such subtractions make possible the
measurement of the proper flux of point-source objects superimposed on extended
sources. In traditional difference photometry, a single image is designated as
the ``template'' image and subtracted from all other observations. This
procedure does not take all the available information into account and for
sub-optimal template images may produce poor results. Given N total
observations of an object, we show how to obtain an estimate of the vector of
fluxes from the individual images using the antisymmetric matrix of flux
differences formed from the N(N-1)/2 distinct possible subtractions and provide
a prescription for estimating the associated uncertainties. We then demonstrate
how this method improves results over the standard procedure of designating one
image as a ``template'' and differencing against only that image.",2005-07-25T20:03:58Z
A Gamma-Ray Bursts' Fluence-Duration Correlation,"We present an analysis indicating that there is a correlation between the
fluences and the durations of gamma-ray bursts, and provide arguments that this
reflects a correlation between the total emitted energies and the intrinsic
durations. For the short (long) bursts the total emitted energies are roughly
proportional to the first (second) power of the intrinsic duration. This
difference in the energy-duration relationship is statistically significant,
and may provide an interesting constraint on models aiming to explain the short
and long gamma-ray bursts.",2005-08-01T05:51:38Z
"First Estimate of the Primary Cosmic Ray Energy Spectrum above 3 EeV
  from the Pierre Auger Observatory","Measurements of air showers are accumulating at an increasing rate while
construction proceeds at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Although the southern
site is only half complete, the cumulative exposure is already similar to those
achieved by the largest forerunner experiments. A measurement of the cosmic ray
energy spectrum in the southern sky is reported here. The methods are simple
and robust, exploiting the combination of fluorescence detector (FD) and
surface detector (SD). The methods do not rely on detailed numerical simulation
or any assumption about the chemical composition.",2005-07-06T20:51:47Z
"Detection and imaging of atmospheric radio flashes from cosmic ray air
  showers","The nature of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies >10^20 eV
remains a mystery. They are likely to be of extragalactic origin, but should be
absorbed within ~50 Mpc through interactions with the cosmic microwave
background. As there are no sufficient powerful accelerators within this
distance from the Galaxy, explanations for UHECRs range from unusual
astrophysical sources to exotic string physics. Also unclear is whether UHECRs
consist of protons, heavy nuclei, neutrinos or gamma-rays. To resolve these
questions, larger detectors with higher duty cycles and which combine multiple
detection techniques are needed. Radio emission from UHECRs, on the other hand,
is unaffected by attenuation, has a high duty cycle, gives calorimetric
measurements and provides high directional accuracy. Here we report the
detection of radio flashes from cosmic-ray air showers using low-cost digital
radio receivers. We show that the radiation can be understood in terms of the
geosynchrotron effect. Our results show that it should be possible to determine
the nature and composition of UHECRs with combined radio and particle
detectors, and to detect the ultrahigh-energy neutrinos expected from flavour
mixing.",2005-05-18T17:20:35Z
"Imaging Bright Spots in the Accretion Flow Near the Black Hole Horizon
  of Sgr A*","Images from the vicinity of the black hole horizon at the Galactic centre
(Sgr A*) could be obtained in the near future with a Very Large Baseline Array
of sub-millimetre telescopes. The recently observed short-term infrared and
X-ray variability of the emission from Sgr A* implies that the accretion flow
near the black hole is clumpy or unsteady. We calculate the appearance of a
compact emission region (bright spot) in a circular orbit around a spinning
black hole as a function of orbital radius and orientation. We find that the
mass and spin of the black hole can be extracted from their generic signatures
on the spot image as well as on the lightcurves of its observed flux and
polarisation. The strong-field distortion remains noticeable even when the spot
image is smoothed over the expected ~20 microarcsecond resolution of future
sub-millimetre observations.",2005-06-18T00:34:03Z
Polarization of high-energy pulsar radiation in the striped wind model,"The Stokes parameters of the pulsed synchrotron radiation produced in the
striped pulsar wind model are computed and compared with optical observations
of the Crab pulsar. We assume the main contribution to the wind emissivity
comes from a thin transition layer where the dominant toroidal magnetic field
reverses its polarity. The radial component of the field is neglected, but a
small meridional component is added. The resulting radiation is linearly
polarized (Stokes V=0). In the off-pulse region, the electric vector lies in
the direction of the projection on the sky of the rotation axis of the pulsar.
This property is unique to the wind model and in good agreement with the data.
Other properties such as a reduced degree of polarization and a characteristic
sweep of the polarization angle within the pulses are also reproduced. These
properties are qualitatively unaffected by variations of the wind Lorentz
factor, the electron injection power law index and the inclination of the line
of sight.",2005-05-20T06:14:48Z
Fitting the HiRes Spectra,"We fit the HiRes ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) spectrum measurements
with broken power laws in order to identify features. These fits find the
previously observed feature known as the Ankle at 10**18.5 eV, as well as
evidence for a suppression at higher energies, above 10**19.8 eV. We use the
integral spectrum and the E_1/2 test to identify this high energy suppression
with the GZK suppression. Finally, we use a model of uniformly distributed
extragalactic proton sources together with a phenomenological model of the
galactic cosmic ray spectrum to compare the HiRes spectra to what should be
expected from the GZK suppression, and to measure how the extragalactic sources
must evolve and what the input spectral slope must be to fit the HiRes data.
Fits using updated spectra will be presented in Pune.",2005-07-20T17:41:18Z
Spherical Collapse Model And Dark Energy(II),"This is a second paper of a series of two. In this paper, we directly correct
the problem pointed out in the first paper of this series, dark energy does not
cluster on the scale of galaxy clusters, but the current describing the flowing
of dark energies outside the clusters is ignored in almost all the previous
papers. We set up and solve a first order differential equation which describes
the evolution of the clusters in a back ground universe containing dark
energies.
  From the solution we extract the key parameters of the model and find them
depending on the equation of state coefficients of dark energies rather
non-trivially. We then apply the results in Press-Scheter theory and calculate
the number density of galaxy clusters and its evolutions, we find the
observable quantities are strongly affected by the equation of state
coefficients of dark energies.",2005-05-09T13:51:59Z
Stringy Dark Energy Model with Cold Dark Matter,"Cosmological consequences of adding the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) to the exactly
solvable stringy Dark Energy (DE) model are investigated. The model is
motivated by the consideration of our Universe as a slowly decaying D3-brane.
The decay of this D-brane is described in the String Field Theory framework.
Stability conditions of the exact solution with respect to small fluctuations
of the initial value of the CDM energy density are found. Solutions with large
initial value of the CDM energy density attracted by the exact solution without
CDM are constructed numerically. In contrast to the LambdaCDM model the Hubble
parameter in the model is not a monotonic function of time. For specific
initial data the DE state parameter w_{DE} is also not monotonic function of
time. For these cases there are two separate regions of time where w_{DE} being
less than -1 is close to -1.",2005-05-30T17:36:38Z
Microlensing of Central Images in Strong Gravitational Lens Systems,"We study microlensing of the faint images that form close to the centers of
strong gravitational lens galaxies. These central images, which have finally
begun to yield to observations, naturally appear in dense stellar fields and
may be particularly sensitive to fine granularity in the mass distribution. The
microlensing magnification maps for overfocussed (i.e., demagnified) images
differ strikingly from those for magnified images. In particular, the familiar
""fold"" and ""cusp"" features of maps for magnified images are only present for
certain values of the fraction, f, of the surface mass density contained in
stars. For central images, the dispersion in microlensing magnifications is
generally larger than for normal (minimum and saddle) images, especially when
the source is comparable to or larger than the stellar Einstein radius. The
dispersion depends in a complicated way on f; this behaviour may hold the key
to using microlensing as a probe of the relative densities of stars and dark
matter in the cores of distant galaxies. Quantitatively, we predict that the
central image C in PMN J1632-0033 has a magnification dispersion of 0.6
magnitudes for Rsrc/Rein <~ 1, or 0.3 mag for Rsrc/Rein = 10. For comparison,
the dispersions are 0.5-0.6 mag for image B and 0.05-0.1 mag for image A, if
Rsrc/Rein <~ 1; and just 0.1 mag for B and 0.008 mag for A if Rsrc/Rein = 10.
(The dispersions can be extrapolated to larger sources sizes as sigma \propto
Rsrc^{-1}.) Thus, central images are more susceptible than other lensed images
to microlensing and hence good probes for measuring source sizes.",2005-07-21T20:04:19Z
"Spectroscopic study of blue compact galaxies V. oxygen abundance and the
  metallicity-luminosity relation","This is the fifth paper in a series studying the stellar components, star
formation histories, star formation rates and metallicities of a blue compact
galaxy (BCG) sample. Based on our high-quality ground-based spectroscopic
observations, we have determined the electron temperatures, electron densities,
nitrogen abundances and oxygen abundances for 72 star-forming BCGs in our
sample, using different oxygen abundance indicators. The oxygen abundance
covers the range 7.15 < 12 + log (O/H)< 9.0, and nitrogen is found to be mostly
a product of secondary nucleosynthesis for 12 + log (O/H)>8.2 and apparently a
product of primary nucleosynthesis for 12 + log (O/H)< 8.2. To assess the
possible systematic differences among different oxygen abundance indicators, we
have compared oxygen abundances of BCGs obtained with the Te method, R23
method, P method, N2 method and O3N2 method. The oxygen abundances derived from
the Te method are systematically lower by 0.1-0.25 dex than those derived from
the strong line empirical abundance indicators, consistent with previous
studies based on region samples. We confirm the existence of the
metallicity-luminosity relation in BCGs over a large range of abundances and
luminosities. Our sample of galaxies shows that the slope of the
metallicity-luminosity relation for the luminous galaxies (~-0.05) is slightly
shallower than that for the dwarf galaxies (~-0.17). An offset was found in the
metallicity-luminosity relation of the local galaxies and that of the
intermediate redshift galaxies. It shows that the metallicity-luminosity
relation for the emission line galaxies at high redshift is displaced to lower
abundances, higher luminosities, or both.",2005-07-13T01:51:43Z
A New Wolf-Rayet Star and its Ring Nebula: PCG11,"In a search for new Galactic planetary nebulae from our systematic scans of
the Anglo-Australian Observatory/United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (AAO/UKST)
Halpha survey of the Southern Galactic Plane, we have identified a Pop I
Wolf-Rayet star of type WN7h associated with an unusual ring nebula that has a
fractured rim. We present imagery in Halpha, the 843-MHz continuum from the
Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST), the mid-infrared from the
Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), and confirmatory optical spectroscopy of the
character of the nebula and of its central star. The inner edge of the Halpha
shell shows gravitational instabilities with a well-defined wavelength around
its complete circumference.",2005-04-22T05:27:20Z
The Type Ia Supernova Rate,"We explore the idea that the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) rate consists of two
components: a prompt piece that is proportional to the star formation rate
(SFR) and an extended piece that is proportional to the total stellar mass. We
fit the parameters of this model to the local observations of Mannucci and
collaborators and then study its impact on three important problems. On cosmic
scales, the model reproduces the observed SNe Ia rate density below z=1, and
predicts that it will track the measured SFR density at higher redshift,
reaching a value of 1-3.5 X 10^-4 per yr per Mpc^3 at z=2. In galaxy clusters,
a large prompt contribution helps explain the iron content of the intracluster
medium. Within the Galaxy, the model reproduces the observed stellar [O/Fe]
abundance ratios if we allow a short (approximately 0.7 Gyr) delay in the
prompt component. Ongoing medium-redshift SN surveys will yield more accurate
parameters for our model",2005-07-19T20:15:55Z
"On the V-type asteroids outside the Vesta family. I. Interplay of
  nonlinear secular resonances and the Yarkovsky effect: the cases of 956 Elisa
  and 809 Lundia","Among the largest objects in the main belt, asteroid 4 Vesta is unique in
showing a basaltic crust. It is also the biggest member of the Vesta family,
which is supposed to originate from a large cratering event about 1 Gyr ago
(Marzari et al. 1996). Most of the members of the Vesta family for which a
spectral classification is available show a V-type spectra. Before the
discovery of 1459 Magnya (Lazzaro et al. 2000) and of several V-type NEA (Xu
1995), all the known V-type asteroids were members of the Vesta family.
Recently two V-type asteroids, 809 Lundia and 956 Elisa, (Florczak et al. 2002)
have been discovered well outside the limits of the family, near the Flora
family. We currently know 22 V-type asteroids outside the family, in the inner
asteroid belt. In this work we investigate the possibility that these objects
are former family members that migrated to their current positions via the
interplay of Yarkovsky effect and nonlinear secular resonances. The main
dynamical feature of 956 Elisa and 809 Lundia is that they are currently inside
the 2(g-g6)+s-s6 (z2 by Milani and Knezevic, 1993) secular resonance. Our
investigations show that members of the Vesta dynamical family may drift in
three-body and weak secular resonances until they are captured in the strong z2
secular resonance. Only asteroids with diameters larger than 16 km can remain
in one of the three-body or secular resonances long enough to reach the region
of the z2 resonance. This two-step mechanism of capture into the z2 resonance
could explain: i) the current resonant orbits of 956 Elisa and 809 Lundia, ii)
why their size is significantly larger than that of the typical member of the
Vesta family, and iii) provide a lower limit on the Vesta family age.",2005-06-27T17:00:07Z
The pulsed X-ray light curves of the isolated neutron star RBS1223,"We present a multi-epoch spectral and timing analysis of the isolated neutron
star RBS1223. New XMM-Newton data obtained in January 2004 confirm the spin
period to be twice as long as previously thought, P_spin = 10.31 s. The
combined ROSAT, Chandra, XMM-Newton data (6 epochs) give, contrary to earlier
findings, no clear indication of a spin evolution of the neutron star. The
X-ray light curves are double-humped with pronounced hardness ratio variations
suggesting an inhomogeneous surface temperature with two spots separated by
about ~160 degr. The sharpness of the two humps suggests a mildly relativistic
star with a ratio between R_ns, the neutron star radius at source, and r_S, the
Schwarzschild-radius, of R_ns/r_S > 3.5. Assuming Planckian energy
distributions as local radiation sources, light curves were synthesized which
were found to be in overall qualitative agreement with observed light curves in
two different energy bands. The temperature distribution used was based on the
crustal field models by Geppert et al. (2004) for a central temperature of T_c
= 10^8 K and an external dipolar field of B ~ 10^{13} G. This gives a mean
atmospheric temperature of 55 eV. A much simpler model with two homogeneous
spots with T_\infty = 92 eV, and 84 eV, and a cold rest star, T_star,\infty <
45 eV, invisible at X-ray wavelengths, was found to be similarly successful.
The new temperature determination and the new dot(P)_{spin} suggest that the
star is older than previously thought, T \simeq 10^(5..6) yrs. The
model-dependent distance to RBS1223 is estimated between 76 pc and 380 pc (for
R_ns = 12 km).",2005-05-26T15:01:53Z
Power Law Spectra in the Nature: Analogies with the Cosmic Ray Spectrum,"Examples of the power law spectra observations in the Nature are given. It is
shown that the observed meteoroid mass spectrum is very similar to the observed
cosmic ray energy spectrum. It is concluded that the ""knees"" observed in both
spectra have a similar origin: the Earth's atmosphere. Both spectra are studied
by indirect methods through secondary components and specific behavior of these
components in the atmosphere could produce the ""knee"" even in a case when
primary spectrum follows a pure power law.",2005-07-01T10:45:40Z
High energy gamma-ray emission from the starburst nucleus of NGC 253,"The high density medium that characterizes the central regions of starburst
galaxies and its power to accelerate particles up to relativistic energies make
these objects good candidates as $\gamma$-rays sources. In this paper, a
self-consistent model of the multifrequency emission of the starburst galaxy
NGC 253, from radio to gamma-rays, is presented. The model is in agreement with
all current measurements and provides predictions for the high energy behavior
of the NGC 253 central region. Prospects for observations with the HESS array
and GLAST satellite are especially discussed.",2005-06-10T14:50:20Z
"HS 0943+1404, a true intermediate polar","We have identified a new intermediate polar, HS 0943+1404, as part of our
ongoing search for cataclysmic variables in the Hamburg Quasar Survey. The
orbital and white dwarf spin periods determined from time-resolved photometry
and spectroscopy are Porb ~= 250 min and Pspin = 69.171 +- 0.001 min,
respectively. The combination of a large ratio Pspin/Porb ~= 0.3 and a long
orbital period is very unusual compared to the other known intermediate polars.
The magnetic moment of the white dwarf is estimated to be mu1 ~ 10^{34} G cm^3,
which is in the typical range of polars. Our extensive photometry shows that HS
0943+1404 enters into deep (~ 3 mag) low states, which are also a
characteristic feature of polars. We therefore suggest that the system is a
true ``intermediate'' polar that will eventually synchronise, that is, a
transitional object between intermediate polars and polars. The optical
spectrum of HS 0943+1404 also exhibits a number of unusual emission lines, most
noticeably NII 5680, which is likely to reflect enhanced nitrogen abundances in
the envelope of the secondary.",2005-06-02T11:56:29Z
"Optical observations of type IIP supernova 2004dj: Evidence for the
  asymmetry of $^{56}$Ni ejecta","The photometric and spectroscopic observations of nearby type IIP supernova
2004dj are presented. The $^{56}$Ni mass estimated from the light curve is
$\approx0.02 M_{\odot}$. This estimate is found to be consistent with the
H$\alpha$ luminosity. SN2004dj reveals a strong asymmetry of the H$\alpha$
emission line at the nebular epoch with the shift of the maximum of -1600 km
s$^{-1}$. A similar asymmetric component is detected in H$\beta$, [O I] and [Ca
II] lines. The line asymmetry is interpreted as a result of the asymmetry of
$^{56}$Ni ejecta. The H$\alpha$ profile and its evolution are reproduced in the
model of the asymmetric bipolar $^{56}$Ni and spherical hydrogen distributions.
The mass of the front $^{56}$Ni jet is comparable to the central component and
twice as larger compared to the rear $^{56}$Ni jet. We note that the asymmetric
bipolar structure of of $^{56}$Ni ejecta is revealed also by SN1999em, another
type IIP supernova.",2005-07-29T08:00:57Z
"X-Ray Timing, Spectroscopy and Photometry of the Anomalous X-Ray Pulsar
  Candidate CXOU J010043.1-721134","We present new X-ray timing and spectral results on the 8.0-second X-ray
pulsar CXOU J010043.1-721134 from a series of observations using the Chandra
X-ray Observatory. We find a spin period in 2004 January of 8.020392pm0.000009
seconds. Comparison of this to 2001 Chandra observations implies a period
derivative dot{P} = (1.88 pm 0.08) times 10^{-11} s s^{-1}, leading to an
inferred dipole surface magnetic field of 3.9 times 10^{14} G. The spectrum is
well fit to an absorbed blackbody of temperature kT = 0.38pm0.02 keV with a
power law tail of photon index Gamma = 2.0pm0.6. We find that the source has an
unabsorbed X-ray flux (0.5-10 keV) of 4(+2-1) times 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}
and a corresponding X-ray luminosity of ~2 times 10^{35} erg s^{-1} for a
distance of 60 kpc. These properties support classification of CXOU
J010043.1-721134 as the seventh confirmed anomalous X-ray pulsar,the eleventh
confirmed magnetar, and the first magnetar to be identified in the Small
Magellanic Cloud.",2005-04-15T22:07:51Z
"Particle Acceleration and the Production of Relativistic Outflows in
  Advection-Dominated Accretion Disks with Shocks","Relativistic outflows (jets) of matter are commonly observed from systems
containing black holes. The strongest outflows occur in the radio-loud systems,
in which the accretion disk is likely to have an advection-dominated structure.
In these systems, it is clear that the binding energy of the accreting gas is
emitted primarily in the form of particles rather than radiation. However, no
comprehensive model for the disk structure and the associated outflows has yet
been produced. In particular, none of the existing models establishes a direct
physical connection between the presence of the outflows and the action of a
microphysical acceleration mechanism operating in the disk. In this paper we
explore the possibility that the relativistic protons powering the jet are
accelerated at a standing, centrifugally-supported shock in the underlying
accretion disk via the first-order Fermi mechanism. The theoretical analysis
employed here parallels the early studies of cosmic-ray acceleration in
supernova shock waves, and the particle acceleration and disk structure are
treated in a coupled, self-consistent manner based on a rigorous mathematical
approach. We find that first-order Fermi acceleration at standing shocks in
advection-dominated disks proves to be a very efficient means for accelerating
the jet particles. Using physical parameters appropriate for M87 and SgrA*, we
verify that the jet kinetic luminosities computed using our model agree with
estimates based on observations of the sources.",2005-06-23T02:57:32Z
Alternatives to Dark Matter and Dark Energy,"We review the underpinnings of the standard Newton-Einstein theory of
gravity, and identify where it could possibly go wrong. In particular, we
discuss the logical independence from each other of the general covariance
principle, the equivalence principle and the Einstein equations, and discuss
how to constrain the matter energy-momentum tensor which serves as the source
of gravity. We identify the a priori assumption of the validity of standard
gravity on all distance scales as the root cause of the dark matter and dark
energy problems, and discuss how the freedom currently present in gravitational
theory can enable us to construct candidate alternatives to the standard theory
in which the dark matter and dark energy problems could then be resolved. We
identify three generic aspects of these alternate approaches: that it is a
universal acceleration scale which determines when a luminous Newtonian
expectation is to fail to fit data, that there is a global cosmological effect
on local galactic motions which can replace galactic dark matter, and that to
solve the cosmological constant problem it is not necessary to quench the
cosmological constant itself, but only the amount by which it gravitates.",2005-05-12T19:15:30Z
Direct detection of exo-planets: GQ Lupi,"We present a comparison of our VLT/NACO K-band spectrum of the GQ Lupi

"On the nature of Lithium-rich giant stars: constraints from Beryllium
  abundances","We have derived beryllium abundances for 7 Li-rich giant (A(Li) > 1.5) stars
and 10 other Li-normal giants, with the aim of investigating the origin of the
Lithium in the Li-rich giants. In particular, we test the predictions of the
engulfment scenario proposed by Siess & Livio (1999), where the engulfment of a
brown dwarf or one or more giant planets would lead to a simultaneous
enrichment of 7Li and 9Be. We show that regardless their nature, none of the
stars studied in this paper were found to have detectable beryllium. Using
simple dilution arguments we show that the engulfment of an external object as
the sole source of Li enrichment is ruled out by the Li and Be abundance data.
The present results favor the idea that Li has been produced in the interior of
the stars by a Cameron-Fowler process and brought up to the surface by an extra
mixing mechanism.",2005-04-06T00:31:48Z
The Reddening of Red Supergiants: When Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,"Deriving the physical properties of red supergiants (RSGs) depends upon
accurate corrections for reddening by dust. We use our recent modeling of the
optical spectra of RSGs to address this topic. We find: (1) Previous broad-band
studies have underestimated the correction for extinction in the visible, and
hence the luminousities, if derived from V. (2) A significant fraction of RSGs
in Galactic OB associations and clusters show up to several magnitudes of
excess visual extinction compared to OB stars in the same regions; we argue
that this is likely due to circumstellar dust around the RSGs. (3) RSGs
contribute dust grains at the rate of $3 \times 10^{-8} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-2}$ in the solar neighborhood, comparable to what we estimate for
late-type WC Wolf-Rayet stars, $1 \times 10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$.
In the solar neighborhood this represents only a few percent of the dust
production (which is dominated by low-mass AGBs), but we note that in
low-metallicity starbursts, dust production by RSGs would likely dominate over
other sources.",2005-08-11T04:02:08Z
"Astrometric Methods and Instrumentation to Identify and Characterize
  Extrasolar Planets: A Review","I present a review of astrometric techniques and instrumentation utilized to
search for, detect, and characterize extra-solar planets. First, I briefly
summarize the properties of the present-day sample of extrasolar planets, in
connection with predictions from theoretical models of planet formation and
evolution. Next, the generic approach to planet detection with astrometry is
described, with significant discussion of a variety of technical, statistical,
and astrophysical issues to be faced by future ground-based as well as
space-borne efforts in order to achieve the required degree of measurement
precision. After a brief summary of past and present efforts to detect planets
via milli-arcsecond astrometry, I then discuss the planet-finding capabilities
of future astrometric observatories aiming at micro-arcsecond precision.
Lastly, I outline a number experiments that can be conducted by means of
high-precision astrometry during the next decade, to illustrate its potential
for important contributions to planetary science, in comparison with other
indirect and direct methods for the detection and characterization of planetary
systems.",2005-07-05T23:07:21Z
"Multiwavelength Observations of 3C 66A during the WEBT campaign of 2003
  - 2004","The BL Lac object 3C 66A was the target of an extensive multiwavelength
monitoring campaign from July 2003 through April 2004, involving observations
throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio, infrared, and optical
observations were carried out by the WEBT-ENIGMA collaboration. At higher
energies, 3C 66A was observed in X-rays (RXTE), and at very-high-energy (VHE)
gamma-rays (STACEE, VERITAS). In addition, the source has been observed with
the VLBA at 9 epochs throughout the period September 2003 - December 2004,
including 3 epochs contemporaneous with the core campaign.The WEBT campaign
revealed microvariability with flux changes of ~ 5 % on time scales as short as
\~ 2 hr. The source was in a relatively bright state, with several bright
flares on time scales of several days. The SED indicates a $\nu F_{\nu}$ peak
in the optical regime. A weak trend of optical spectral hysteresis with a trend
of spectral softening throughout both the rising and decaying phases, has been
found. The 3 - 10 keV X-ray flux of 3C 66A during the core campaign was
historically high and its spectrum very soft, indicating that the low-frequency
component of the broadband SED extends beyond ~ 10 keV. No significant X-ray
flux and/or spectral variability was detected. STACEE and Whipple observations
provided upper flux limits at > 150 GeV and > 390 GeV, respectively. The 22 and
43 GHz data from the 3 VLBA epochs between September 2003 and January 2004
indicate a smooth jet with only moderate internal structure. Evidence for
superluminal motion (8.5 +/- 5.6 h^{-1} c) was found in only one out of 6
components. The radial radio brightness profile suggests a magnetic field decay
$\propto r^{-1}$ and, thus, a predominantly perpendicular magnetic field.",2005-06-09T15:24:35Z
Neutrino emission rates in highly magnetized neutron stars revisited,"Magnetars are a subclass of neutron stars whose intense soft-gamma-ray bursts
and quiescent X-ray emission are believed to be powered by the decay of a
strong internal magnetic field. We reanalyze neutrino emission in such stars in
the plausibly relevant regime in which the Landau band spacing of both protons
and electrons is much larger than kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T
is the temperature), but still much smaller than the Fermi energies. Focusing
on the direct Urca process, we find that the emissivity oscillates as a
function of density or magnetic field, peaking when the Fermi level of the
protons or electrons lies about 3kT above the bottom of any of their Landau
bands. The oscillation amplitude is comparable to the average emissivity when
the Landau band spacing mentioned above is roughly the geometric mean of kT and
the Fermi energy (excluding mass), i. e., at fields much weaker than required
to confine all particles to the lowest Landau band. Since the density and
magnetic field strength vary continuously inside the neutron star, there will
be alternating surfaces of high and low emissivity. Globally, these
oscillations tend to average out, making it unclear whether there will be any
observable effects.",2005-05-11T23:25:40Z
Dark matter from extra dimensions,"In brane-world models with low tension, massive branons are natural
candidates for dark matter. The phenomenology of these WIMP-like particles is
completely determined by their mass, the brane tension and, in the case of
effects due to radiative corrections, by the cutoff setting the scale of
validity of the branon effective theory. In this paper, we review the main
constraints on branon physics coming from colliders, astrophysics and
cosmological observations, and include more recent limits obtained from
electroweak precision measurements.",2005-03-29T15:02:51Z
Optimal slit orientation for long multi-object spectroscopic exposures,"Historically, long-slit spectroscopic observations were carried out using the
parallactic angle for the slit orientation if slit loss was an important
consideration (either to maximize the signal-to-noise or to do
spectrophotometry). This requires periodic realignment of the slit position
angle as the parallactic angle changes. This is not possible for multi-slit
observations where one slit position angle must be chosen for the entire
exposure. Common wisdom suggests using the parallactic angle at the meridian
(HA=0). In this paper, I examine what the best strategy is for long, multi-slit
exposures. I find that in extreme cases (very long exposure time) the best
choice is to orient the slit \emph{perpendicular} to the parallactic angle at
the meridian. There are two effects to consider: the increasing dispersion with
increasing airmass and the changing angle between the parallactic angle and the
slit. In the case of \emph{traditional} slit orientation, the two effects
amplify each other, thus rendering a significant fraction of the observation
useless. Using the perpendicular orientation, the two processes work against
each other, thus most of the observation remains useful. I will use, as an
example, our 8 hour Lockman Hole observations using the Keck telescope, but
generic methods are given to evaluate a particular observation. I also make the
tools available to the community.",2005-06-28T09:49:22Z
Velocity Dispersion of Excited H2,"We present a study of the high rotational bands (J > 2) of H2 toward 4 early
type galactic stars: HD 73882, HD 192639, HD 206267, and HD 207538. In each
case, the velocity dispersion - characterized by the spectrum fitting parameter
b - increases with the level of excitation, a phenomenon that has previously
been detected by the Copernicus and IMAPS observatories. In particular, we show
with 4 sigma confidence that for HD 192639 it is not possible to fit all J
levels with a single b value, and that higher b values are needed for the
higher levels. The amplitude of the line broadening, which can be as high as 10
km s^-1, makes explanations such as inhomogeneous spatial distribution
unlikely. We investigate a mechanism in which the broadening is due to the
molecules that are rotationally excited through the excess energy acquired
after their formation on a grain (H2-formation pumping). We show that different
dispersions would be a natural consequence of this mechanism. We note however
that such process would require a formation rate 10 times higher then what was
inferred from other observations. In view of the difficulty to account for the
velocity dispersion as thermal broadening (T would be around 10,000 K), we
conclude then that we are most certainly observing some highly turbulent warm
layer associated with the cold diffuse cloud. Embedded in a magnetic field, it
could be responsible for the high quantities of CH+ measured in the cold
neutral medium.",2005-03-18T18:29:09Z
Evidence for Spectropolarimetric Diversity in Type Ia Supernovae,"We present single-epoch, post-maximum spectropolarimetry of four Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) that span a range of spectral and photometric properties:
SN 2002bf and SN 2004dt exhibit unusually high-velocity (HV) absorption lines.
SN 1997dt is probably somewhat subluminous, and SN 2003du is slightly
overluminous. We detect polarization modulations across strong lines in all
four objects, demonstrating that all are intrinsically polarized. However, the
nature and degree of the polarization varies considerably. Including all SNe Ia
studied thus far, the following order emerges in terms of increasing strength
of line-polarization features: ordinary/overluminous < subluminous < HV SNe Ia,
with the strength of the line-polarization features increasing from 0.2% in the
slightly overluminous SN 2003du to 2% in both of the HV SNe Ia in our study.
The most convincing explanation for the line polarization of all objects is
partial obscuration of the photosphere by clumps of intermediate-mass elements
(IMEs) forged in the explosion; the polarization characteristics of the HV SNe
Ia in particular effectively rule out a simple ellipsoidal asphericity as the
root cause of their line polarization. That SNe Ia are separable into different
groups based on their spectropolarimetric characteristics may help narrow down
progenitor possibilities and/or explosion physics. In particular, the recently
proposed gravitationally confined detonation model may provide an attractive
explanation for many of the observed polarization characteristics of HV SNe Ia.",2005-06-20T20:12:41Z
A helium spread among the main sequence stars in NGC 2808,"We studied the color distribution of the main sequence of the Globular
Cluster NGC 2808, based on new deep HST-WFPC2 photometry of a field in the
uncrowded outskirts of the cluster. The color distribution of main sequence
stars is wider than expected for a single stellar population, given our
(carefully determined) measurement errors. About 20% of the sample stars are
much bluer than expected and are most plausibly explained as a population
having a much larger helium abundance than the bulk of the main sequence. We
estimate that the helium mass fraction of these stars is Y ~ 0.4. NGC 2808 may
have suffered self-enrichment, with different stellar populations born from the
ejecta of the intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of the
first generation. In addition to the Y=0.40 stars, roughly 30% of the stars
should have Y distributed between 0.26-0.29 while 50% have primordial Y, to
explain also the peculiar horizontal branch morphology. Three main stages of
star formation are identified, the first with primordial helium content Y ~
0.24, the second one born from the winds of the most massive AGBs of the first
stellar generation (6-7msun), having Y ~ 0.4, and a third one born from the
matter ejected from less massive AGBs (~ 3.5-4.5msun) with Y ~ 0.26-0.29. For a
long hiatus of time (several 10^7yr) between the second and third generation,
star formation might have been inhibited by the explosion of late Supernovae II
deriving from binary evolution.",2005-05-17T14:15:15Z
"VLT K-band spectroscopy of massive stars deeply embedded in IRAS sources
  with UCHII colours","We have obtained high resolution (R = 10,000) K-band spectra of candidate
young massive stars deeply embedded in (ultra-) compact HII regions (UCHIIs).
In these clusters, three types of objects are identified. The first type (38
objects) consists of ``naked'' OB stars whose K-band spectra are dominated by
photospheric emission. We classify the K-band spectra of the OB-type cluster
members using near-infrared classification criteria. The spectral
classification provides an important constraint on the distance to the embedded
cluster. The ionising power of the population thus derived is compared to the
information obtained from the infrared and radio flux of these sources. In most
cases these two different determinations of the ionising flux are consistent,
from which we conclude that we have identified the ionising star(s) in about
50% of the embedded clusters. The second type (7 objects) are point sources
associated with UCHII radio emission, that exhibit nebular emission lines in
the near-infrared. Six of the objects in this group produce HeI emission
indicative of an embedded O-type star. These objects are more embedded than the
OB stars and probably do not dominate the infrared flux as measured by IRAS.
The third type (20 objects) is characterised by broad (100--200 km/s) Brgamma
emission and no photospheric absorption profiles. Bik et al (2005) show that
these objects are massive YSO candidates surrounded by dense circumstellar
disks.",2005-05-13T18:03:55Z
"Identification of X-ray Point Sources and Study on the Nature of 62
  X-ray Globular Cluster Candidates in M31","This paper includes two parts. The first is to present the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of 49 globular cluster (GC) X-ray sources in the BATC 13
intermediate-band filters from 3800 to 10000 A, and identify 8 unidentified
X-ray sources in M31. Using the X-ray data of Einstein observation from 1979 to
1980, ROSAT HRI observation in 1990, Chandra HRC and ACIS-I observations from
1999 to 2001, and the BATC optical survey from 1995 to 1999, we find 49 GC
X-ray sources and 8 new unidentified X-ray sources in the BATC M31 field. By
analyzing SEDs and FWHMs, 4 of the 8 X-ray sources may be GC candidates. The
second is to present some statistical relationships about 62 GC X-ray sources,
of which 58 are already known, and 4 are identified in this paper. The
distribution of M31 GC X-ray sources' V mags is bimodal, with peaks at m_v =
15.65 and m_v = 17.89, which is different from the distribution of GC
candidates. The distribution of B-V color shows that,the GC X-ray sources seem
to be associated preferentially with the redder GCs, in agreement with the
previous results. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that the maximum value of the
absolute difference of B-V distributions of GC X-ray sources and GCs is
D_{max}=0.181, and the probability P=0.068 which means we can reject the
hypothesis that the two distributions are the same at the 90.0% confidence
level. In the end, we study the correlation between X-ray luminosity (0.3-10
keV) and the optical luminosity (in V band) of the GC X-ray sources in M31, and
find that there exits a weak relationship with the linear correlation
coefficient r = 0.36 at the confidence level of 98.0%.",2005-07-20T08:52:57Z
Neutron star matter equation of state and gravitational wave emission,"The EOS of strongly interacting matter at densities ten to fifteen orders of
magnitude larger than the typical density of terrestrial macroscopic objects
determines a number of neutron star properties, including the pattern of
gravitational waves emitted following the excitation of nonradial oscillation
modes. This paper reviews some of the approaches employed to model neutron star
matter, as well as the prospects for obtaining new insights from the
experimental study of gravitational waves emitted by neutron stars.",2005-07-21T07:55:50Z
H_2 Pure Rotational Lines in the Orion Bar,"Using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) we mapped emission
in the H_2 v = 0-0 S(1) and S(2) lines toward the Orion Bar PDR at 2""
resolution. We also observed H_2 v = 0-0 S(4) at selected points toward the
front of the PDR. Our maps cover a 12"" by 40"" region of the bar where H_2
ro-vibrational lines are bright. The distributions of H_2 0-0 S(1), 0-0 S(2),
and 1-0 S(1) line emission agree in remarkable detail.
  The high spatial resolution (0.002 pc) of our observations allows us to probe
the distribution of warm gas in the Orion Bar to a distance approaching the
scale length for FUV photon absorption. We use these new observational results
to set parameters for the PDR models described in a companion paper (Draine et
al. 2005, in prep). The best-fit model can account for the separation of the
H_2 emission from the ionization front and the intensities of the ground state
rotational lines as well as the 1-0 S(1) and 2-1 S(1) lines. This model
requires significant adjustments to the commonly used values for the dust UV
attenuation cross section and the photoelectric heating rate.",2005-05-31T22:46:19Z
Interstellar extinction towards open clusters and galactic structure,"We study the distribution of interstellar matter near the galactic plane on
the basis of open star clusters and reviewed the correlation of extinction with
different physical parameters of the clusters to understand the galactic
structure. It is seen from the extinction towards open clusters that about 90%
of the absorbing material lie within -5<b<5 deg of the galactic plane. The mean
thickness of the absorbing material, which is determined in terms of half-width
value \beta, is estimated to be about 125+/-21 pc. We show that the
interstellar absorption follows a sinusoidal variation with galactic longitude
and maximum and minimum absorptions occur at l ~ 48+/-4 deg and l ~ 228+/-4 deg
respectively. It is found that the galactic plane defined by the reddening
material is inclined by an angle of 0.6+/-0.4 deg to the formal galactic plane
and inclination is maximum at l ~ 54+/-6 deg. The reddening analysis has been
used to constrain the Solar offset which is found to be about 22.8+/-3.3 pc
above the reddening plane. We obtained a scale height of 53+/-5 pc for the
distribution of open clusters while it is 186+/-25 pc for the distribution of
reddening material from the reddening plane.",2005-07-04T14:28:14Z
Optimized Data Loading for a Multi-Terabyte Sky Survey Repository,"Advanced instruments in a variety of scientific domains are collecting
massive amounts of data that must be post-processed and organized to support
scientific research activities. Astronomers have been pioneers in the use of
databases to host highly structured repositories of sky survey data. As more
powerful telescopes come online, the increased volume and complexity of the
data collected poses enormous challenges to state-of-the-art database systems
and data-loading techniques. When the data source is an instrument taking
ongoing samples, the database loading must, at a minimum, keep up with the
data-acquisition rate. These challenges are being faced not only by the
astronomy community, but also by other scientific disciplines interested in
building scalable databases to house multi-terabyte archives of complex
structured data. In this paper we present SkyLoader, our novel framework for
fast and scalable data loading that is being used to populate a multi-table,
multi-terabyte database repository for the Palomar-Quest sky survey. Our
framework consists of an efficient algorithm for bulk loading, an effective
data structure to support data integrity and proper error handling during the
loading process, support for optimized parallelism that matches the number of
concurrent loaders with the database host capabilities, and guidelines for
database and system tuning. Performance studies showing the positive effects of
the adopted strategies are also presented. Our parallel bulk loading with array
buffering technique has made fast population of a multi-terabyte repository a
reality, reducing the loading time for a 40-gigabyte data set from more than 20
hours to less than 3 hours. We believe our framework offers a promising
approach for loading other large and complex scientific databases.",2005-08-04T21:34:22Z
Extracting New Physics from the CMB,"We review how initial state effects generically yield an oscillatory
component in the primordial power spectrum of inflationary density
perturbations. These oscillatory corrections parametrize unknown new physics at
a scale $M$ and are potentially observable if the ratio $H_{infl}/M$ is
sufficiently large. We clarify to what extent present and future CMB data
analysis can distinguish between the different proposals for initial state
corrections.",2005-03-21T21:42:49Z
Origin of long-period Alfv{é}n waves in the solar wind,"We suggest that the observed long-period Alfv{\'e}n waves in the solar wind
may be generated in the solar interior due to the pulsation of the Sun in the
fundamental radial mode. The period of this pulsation is about 1 hour. The
pulsation causes a periodical variation of density and large-scale magnetic
field, this affecting the Alfv{\'e}n speed in the solar interior. Consequently
the Alfv{\'e}n waves with the half frequency of pulsation (i.e. with the double
period) can be parametrically amplified in the interior below the convection
zone due to the recently suggested swing wave-wave interaction. Therefore the
amplified Alfv{\'e}n waves have periods of several hours. The waves can
propagate upwards through the convection zone to the solar atmosphere and cause
the observed long-period Alfv{\'e}n oscillations in the solar wind.",2005-06-30T13:57:32Z
Multi-phase High-Velocity Clouds toward HE 0226-4110 and PG 0953+414,"We study the physical conditions, elemental abundances, and kinematics of the
high-velocity clouds (HVCs) along the sight lines toward active galaxies
HE0226-4110 and PG0953+414 using Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer data. Our observations reveal
multiple components of HVC absorption in lines of HI, CII, CIII, CIV, OVI,
SiII, SiIII, and SiIV in both directions. We investigate whether
photoionization by the extragalactic background radiation or by escaping Milky
Way radiation can explain the observed ionization pattern. We find that
photoionization is a good explanation for the CII, CIII, SiII, and SiIII
features, but not for the OVI or CIV associated with the HVCs, suggesting that
two principal phases exist: a warm (T~10^4K), photoionized phase and a hotter
(T=1-3x10^5K), collisionally-ionized phase. The warm HVCs toward HE0226-4110
have high levels of ionization (97-99%), and metallicities ([Z/H] between -0.9
and -0.4) close to those in the Magellanic Stream, which lies eleven degrees
away on the sky at similar velocities. These HVCs have thermal pressures that
would place them close to equilibrium in a fully ionized 10^6 K Galactic corona
with n_H=4-9x10^{-5}cm^{-3} at 50 kpc. A mini-survey of the hot, collisionally
ionized HVC components seen here and in five other sight lines finds that in
11/12 cases, the high ions have kinematics and ionic ratios that are consistent
with an origin in conductive interfaces. However, the broad absorption wing on
the OVI profile toward PG0953+414 is not completely explained by the interface
scenario, and may be tracing the outflow of hot gas into the Milky Way halo as
part of a Galactic fountain or wind.",2005-05-13T20:00:32Z
"XMM-Newton View of PKS 2155-304: Characterizing the X-ray Variability
  Properties with EPIC-PN","Starting from XMM-Newton EPIC-PN data, we present the X-ray variability
characteristics of PKS 2155-304 using a simple analysis of the excess variance,
\xs, and of the fractional rms variability amplitude, fvar. The scatter in \xs\
and \fvar, calculated using 500 s long segments of the light curves, is smaller
than the scatter expected for red noise variability. This alone does not imply
that the underlying process responsible for the variability of the source is
stationary, since the real changes of the individual variance estimates are
possibly smaller than the large scatters expected for a red noise process. In
fact the averaged \xs and \fvar, reducing the fluctuations of the individual
variances, chang e with time, indicating non-stationary variability. Moreover,
both the averaged \sqxs (absolute rms variability amplitude) and \fvar show
linear correlation with source flux but in an opposite sense: \sqxs correlates
with flux, but \fvar anti-correlates with flux. These correlations suggest that
the variability process of the source is strongly non-stationary as random
scatters of variances should not yield any correlation. \fvar spectra were
constructed to compare variability amplitudes in different energy bands. We
found that the fractional rms variability amplitude of the source, when
significant variability is observed, increases logarithmically with the photon
energy, indicating significant spectral variability. The point-to-point
variability amplitude may also track this trend, suggesting that the slopes of
the power spectral density of the source are energy-independent. Using the
normalized excess variance the black hole mass of \pks was estimated to be
about $1.45 \times 10^8 M_{\bigodot}$. This is compared and contrasted with the
estimates derived from measurements of the host galaxies.",2005-05-09T03:31:47Z
"Evidence for Granulation and Oscillations in Procyon from Photometry
  with the WIRE satellite","We report evidence for the granulation signal in the star Procyon A, based on
two photometric time series from the star tracker on the WIRE satellite. The
power spectra show evidence of excess power around 1 milliHz, consistent with
the detection of p-modes reported from radial velocity measurements. We see a
significant increase in the noise level below 3 milliHz, which we interpret as
the granulation signal. We have made a large set of numerical simulations to
constrain the amplitude and timescale of the granulation signal and the
amplitude of the oscillations. We find that the timescale for granulation is
T(gran) = 750(200) s, the granulation amplitude is 1.8(0.3) times solar, and
the amplitude of the p-modes is 8(3) ppm. We found the distribution of peak
heights in the observed power spectra to be consistent with that expected from
p-mode oscillations. However, the quality of the data is not sufficient to
measure the large separation or detect a comb-like structure, as seen in the
p-modes of the Sun. Comparison with the recent negative result from the MOST
satellite reveal that the MOST data must have an additional noise source that
prevented the detection of oscillations.",2005-04-21T13:54:58Z
The Island state of the Atoll Source 4U 1820--30,"We study the rapid X-ray time variability in all public data available from
the \textit{Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer's} Proportional Counter Array on the
atoll source 4U 1820--30 in the low-luminosity island state. A total of
$\sim46$ ks of data were used. We compare the frequencies of the variability
components of 4U 1820--30 with those in other atolls sources. These frequencies
were previously found to follow a universal scheme of correlations. We find
that 4U 1820--30 shows correlations that are shifted by factors of
$1.13\pm0.01$ and $1.21\pm0.02$ with respect to those in other atoll sources.
These shifts are similar to, but smaller than the shift factor $\sim1.45$
previously reported for some accreting millisecond pulsars. Therefore, 4U
1820--30 is the first atoll source which shows no significant pulsations but
has a significant shift in the frequency correlations compared with other 3
non-pulsating atoll sources.",2005-07-05T14:12:11Z
Stellar dynamo driven wind braking instead of disc coupling,"Star-disc coupling is considered in numerical models where the stellar field
is not an imposed perfect dipole, but instead a more irregular self-adjusting
dynamo-generated field. Using axisymmetric simulations of the hydromagnetic
mean-field equations, it is shown that the resulting stellar field
configuration is more complex, but significantly better suited for driving a
stellar wind. In agreement with recent findings by a number of people,
star-disc coupling is less efficient in braking the star than previously
thought. Moreover, stellar wind braking becomes equally important. In contrast
to a perfect stellar dipole field, dynamo-generated stellar fields favor
field-aligned accretion with considerably higher velocity at low latitudes,
where the field is weaker and originating in the disc. Accretion is no longer
nearly periodic (as it is in the case of a stellar dipole), but it is more
irregular and episodic.",2005-04-03T17:55:55Z
Populations of AGB stars and LPVs in the Galaxy and Local Group,"In this review I will discuss recent developments on the topic of resolved
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and Long Period Variables (LPVs) in our
Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and the Local Group in general. Since the main
characteristics of AGB stars are (1) their infrared, (2) pulsational and (3)
chemical properties, it is fitting that I will focus on recent results from the
(a) 2MASS/DENIS and MSX near- and mid-IR surveys, the (b) micro-lensing surveys

Magnetohydrodynamics in full general relativity: Formulation and tests,"A new implementation for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations in full
general relativity (involving dynamical spacetimes) is presented. In our
implementation, Einstein's evolution equations are evolved by a BSSN formalism,
MHD equations by a high-resolution central scheme, and induction equation by a
constraint transport method. We perform numerical simulations for standard test
problems in relativistic MHD, including special relativistic magnetized shocks,
general relativistic magnetized Bondi flow in stationary spacetime, and a
longterm evolution for self-gravitating system composed of a neutron star and a
magnetized disk in full general relativity. In the final test, we illustrate
that our implementation can follow winding-up of the magnetic field lines of
magnetized and differentially rotating accretion disks around a compact object
until saturation, after which magnetically driven wind and angular momentum
transport inside the disk turn on.",2005-07-16T04:54:09Z
"The Effective Temperature Scale of Galactic Red Supergiants: Cool, But
  Not As Cool As We Thought","We use moderate-resolution optical spectrophotometry and the new MARCS
stellar atmosphere models to determine the effective temperatures of 74
Galactic red supergiants. From these we find a new effective temperature scale
that is significantly warmer than those in the literature. We show that this
temperature scale, along with the newly derived bolometric corrections, gives
much better agreement between our red supergiants and stellar evolutionary
tracks. This agreement provides an independent verification of our new
temperature scale. The combination of effective temperature and bolometric
luminosities allows us to calculate stellar radii; the coolest and most
luminous stars have radii of roughly 1500 solar radii (7 AU), in excellent
accordance with the largest stellar radii predicted from current evolutionary
theory. We find that similar results are obtained for the effective
temperatures and bolometric luminosities using only the de-reddened V-K colors,
providing a powerful demonstration of the self-consistency of the MARCS models.",2005-04-15T02:25:47Z
"Supernova Blastwaves in Low-density Hot Media: a Mechanism for Spatially
  Distributed Heating","Most supernovae are expected to explode in low-density hot media,
particularly in galactic bulges and elliptical galaxies. The remnants of such
supernovae, though difficult to detect individually, can be profoundly
important in heating the media on large scales. We characterize the evolution
of this kind of supernova remnants, based on analytical approximations and
hydrodynamic simulations. We generalize the standard Sedov solution to account
for both temperature and density effects of the ambient media. Although cooling
can be neglected, the expansion of such a remnant deviates quickly from the
standard Sedov solution and asymptotically approaches the ambient sound speed
as the swept-up thermal energy becomes important. The relatively steady and
fast expansion of the remnants over large volumes provides an ideal mechanism
for spatially distributed heating, which may help to alleviate the over-cooling
problem of hot gas in groups and clusters of galaxies as well as in galaxies
themselves. The simulations were performed with the FLASH code.",2005-04-13T04:22:43Z
Protoneutron star dynamos and pulsar magnetism,"We have investigated the turbulent mean-field dynamo action in protoneutron
stars that are subject to convective and neutron finger instabilities during
the early evolutionary phase. While the first one develops mostly in the inner
regions of the star, the second one is favored in the outer regions, where the
Rossby number is much smaller and a mean-field dynamo action is more efficient.
By solving the mean-field induction equation we have computed the critical spin
period below which no dynamo action is possible and found it to be $\sim 1$ s
for a wide range of stellar models and for both axisymmetric and
non-axisymmetric magnetic fields. Because this critical period is substantially
longer than the characteristic spin period of very young pulsars, we expect
that a mean-field dynamo will be effective for most protoneutron stars. The
saturation dipole field estimated by making use of the model of ``global''
quenching fits well the pulsar magnetic fields inferred from the spin-down
data. Apart from the large scale magnetic field, our model predicts also a
generation of small scale fields which are typically stronger than the poloidal
field and can survive during the lifetime of pulsars. Extremely rapidly
rotating protoneutron stars ($P \sim 1$ ms) may have the dipole field $\sim
(3-6) \times 10^{14}$ G.",2005-04-14T14:40:56Z
"CAIRNS: The Cluster And Infall Region Nearby Survey III. Environmental
  Dependence of H-alpha Properties of Galaxies","We investigate the environmental dependence of star formation in cluster
virial regions and infall regions as part of CAIRNS (Cluster And Infall Region
Nearby Survey), a large spectroscopic survey of the infall regions surrounding
nine nearby rich clusters of galaxies. Our long-slit spectroscopy yields
estimates of star formation rates in environments from cluster cores to the
general large-scale structure. The fraction of galaxies with current star
formation in their inner disks as traced by H-alpha emission increases with
distance from the cluster and converges to the ``field'' value only at 2-3
virial radii, in agreement with other investigations. However, among galaxies
with significant current star formation (EW[Ha]geq2\AA), there is no difference
in the distribution of EW[Ha] inside and outside the virial radius. This
surprising result, first seen by Carter et al., suggests that (1) star
formation is truncated on either very short timescales or only at moderate and
high redshifts or (2) that projection effects contaminate the measurement. The
number density profiles of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies indicate
that, among galaxies projected inside the virial radius, at least half of the
former and 20% of the latter are ``infall interlopers,'' galaxies in the infall
region but outside the virial region. The kinematics of star-forming galaxies
in the infall region closely match those of absorption-dominated galaxies. This
result shows that the star forming galaxies in the infall regions are not
interlopers from the field and excludes one model of the backsplash scenario of
galaxy transformation. Finally, we quantify systematic uncertainties in
estimating the global star formation in galaxies from their inner disks.",2005-06-27T20:00:04Z
"A COMPLETE Look at The Use of IRAS Emission Maps to Estimate Extinction
  and Dust Temperature","We have created new dust temperature and column density maps of Perseus,
Ophiuchus and Serpens using 60 and 100 micron data from the IRIS recalibration
of IRAS data. We describe an optimized method for finding the dust temperature,
emissivity spectral index, and optical depth using optical and NIR extinction
maps. The creation of these temperature and extinction maps (covering tens of
square degrees of molecular clouds) is one of the first results from the
ongoing COordinated Molecular Probe Line Extinction Thermal Emission (COMPLETE)
Survey of Star Forming regions. However, while the extinctions derived from the
IRIS emission maps are globally accurate, we warn that FIR emission is not a
good proxy for extinction on the scale of one pixel (5').",2005-08-01T15:53:53Z
"The WEBT campaign to observe AO 0235+16 in the 2003-2004 observing
  season","A multiwavelength campaign on the BL Lac object AO 0235+16 has been organized
by the WEBT collaboration during the observing seasons 2003-2004 and 2004-2005.
Here we report on the results of the first season, which saw the participation
of 24 optical and near-IR telescopes and 4 radio telescopes, as well as the
first XMM-Newton pointing, which occurred on January 18-19, 2004. Unpublished
data from previous epochs were also collected. In the optical and near-IR the
source has been very active in the last 3 years, though rather faint most of
the time, with noticeable variations of more than a mag in a few days. In
contrast, in the radio bands it appears ""quiescent"" since early 2000. The X-ray
spectra obtained by the three EPIC detectors are well fitted by a power law
with extra-absorption at z=0.524. No significant variation of the X-ray flux
occurred during the pointing. In contrast, contemporaneous dense radio
monitoring with the 100 m telescope at Effelsberg shows a ~2-3% flux decrease
in 6-7 hours, which, if intrinsic, would imply a brightness temperature well
above the Compton limit. We construct the broad-band spectral energy
distribution of January 18-19, 2004 with simultaneous radio data from
Effelsberg, optical data from the Nordic Optical Telescope, optical-UV data
from the Optical Monitor onboard XMM-Newton, and X-ray data by the EPIC
instruments. Particular care was taken to correct data for extinction due to
both the Milky Way and the z=0.524 absorber. The resulting SED suggests the
existence of a bump in the UV spectral region.",2005-03-15T11:01:19Z
VLA 3.5 cm continuum sources in the Serpens cloud core,"We present VLA 3.5 cm continuum observations of the Serpens cloud core. 22
radio continuum sources are detected. 16 out of the 22 cm sources are suggested
to be associated with young stellar objects (Class 0, Class I, flat-spectrum,
and Class II) of the young Serpens cluster. The rest of the VLA sources
plausibly are background objects. Most of the Serpens cm sources likely
represent thermal radio jets; on the other hand, the radio continuum emission
of some sources could be due to a gyrosynchroton mechanism arising from
coronally active young stars. The Serpens VLA sources are spatially distributed
into two groups; one of them located towards the NW clump of the Serpens core,
where only Class 0 and Class I protostars are found to present cm emission, and
a second group located towards the SE clump, where radio continuum sources are
associated with objects in evolutionary classes from Class 0 to Class II. This
subgrouping is similar to that found in the near IR, mid-IR and mm wavelength
regimes.",2005-06-02T10:50:41Z
Anti-Truncation of Disks in Early-Type Barred Galaxies,"The disks of spiral galaxies are commonly thought to be truncated: the radial
surface brightness profile steepens sharply beyond a certain radius (3--5
inner-disk scale lengths). Here we present the radial brightness profiles of a
number of barred S0--Sb galaxies with the opposite behavior: their outer
profiles are distinctly shallower in slope than the main disk profile. We term
these ""anti-truncations""; they are found in at least 25% of a larger sample of
barred S0--Sb galaxies. There are two distinct types of anti-truncations. About
one-third show a fairly gradual transition and outer isophotes which are
progressively rounder than the main disk isophotes, suggestive of a disk
embedded within a more spheroidal outer zone -- either the outer extent of the
bulge or a separate stellar halo. But the majority of the profiles have rather
sharp surface-brightness transitions to the shallower, outer exponential
profile and, crucially, outer isophotes which are not significantly rounder
than the main disk; in the Sab--Sb galaxies, the outer isophotes include
visible spiral arms. This suggests that the outer light is still part of the
disk. A subset of these profiles are in galaxies with asymmetric outer
isophotes (lopsided or one-armed spirals), suggesting that interactions may be
responsible for at least some of the disklike anti-truncations.",2005-05-11T17:07:07Z
"Expectations for the Deep Impact collision from cometary nuclei
  modelling","Using the cometary nucleus model developed by Espinasse et al. (1991), we
calculate the thermodynamical evolution of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 over a period of
360 years. Starting from an initially amorphous cometary nucleus which
incorporates an icy mixture of H2O and CO, we show that, at the time of Deep
Impact collision, the crater is expected to form at depths where ice is in its
crystalline form. Hence, the subsurface exposed to space should not be
primordial. We also attempt an order-of-magnitude estimate of the heating and
material ablation effects on the crater activity caused by the 370 Kg
projectile released by the DI spacecraft. We thus show that heating effects
play no role in the evolution of crater activity. We calculate that the CO
production rate from the impacted region should be about 300-400 times higher
from the crater resulting from the impact with a 35 m ablation than over the
unperturbed nucleus in the immediate post-impact period. We also show that the
H2O production rate is decreased by several orders of magnitude at the crater
base just after ablation.",2005-06-29T13:08:41Z
"The 'Hubble-type' outflows from the high excitation, poly-polar
  planetary nebula NGC 6302","Spatially resolved profiles of the Halpha and [NII] lines have been obtained
at unprecendented signal--to--noise ratios over the outflowing lobes of the
high--excitation, poly--polar planetary nebula NGC~6302. A deep image in the
light of [NII]6584 A was also obtained of the extremities of the prominent
north--western lobe. The Manchester Echelle spectrometer combined with the
2.1--m San Pedro Martir telescope (Mexico) was used for these observations.
  Firstly, an accurate value of the systemic heliocentric radial velocity of
Vsys = -29.8 +/- 1 km/s has been established. Also, from `velocity ellipses'
across its diameter from previous observations the parallel--sided
north--western lobe is shown to have a circular section with a tilt of its axis
to the plane of the sky of 12.8 deg. With this starting point the pv arrays of
profiles have been very closely simulated, using the SHAPE code, with
Hubble-type outflows. The faint extremities of the north--western outflow are
shown to be expanding at 600 km/s. The prominent lobes of NGC~6302 have then
been generated in an eruptive event with a dynamical age of 1900 y for the
expansion proper-motion distance of 1.04 +/- 0.16 kpc as measured here by
comparing a 1956 image with that taken in 2002.
  Kinematical evidence of a high--speed `skirt' around the nebular core,
expanding nearly orthogonally to the lobes, is also presented as are the
unusual motions at the western extremities of the NW lobe.",2005-07-28T19:57:54Z
On the future of Gamma-Ray Burst Cosmology,"With the understanding that the enigmatic Gamma-Ray Burts (GRBs) are beamed
explosions, and with the recently discovered ``Ghirlanda-relation'', the dream
of using GRBs as cosmological yardsticks may have come a few steps closer to
reality. Assuming the Ghirlanda-relation is real, we have investigated possible
constraints on cosmological parameters using a simulated future sample of a
large number of GRBs inspired by the ongoing SWIFT mission. Comparing with
constraints from a future sample of Type Ia supernovae, we find that GRBs are
not efficient in constraining the amount of dark energy or its equation of
state. The main reason for this is that very few bursts are available at low
redshifts.",2005-04-11T15:40:07Z

HD 12098 and other results from NainiTal-Cape survey,"NainiTal-Cape Survey is a survey started with the aim of searching for new
rapidly oscillating Ap stars in the northern hemisphere and has discovered one
mono-periodic roAp star HD 12098. The frequency separation of HD 12098 suggests
a rotation period of 5.5 day for the star. The discovery of roAp oscillations
in HD 12098 and the results of the multi-site observation campaign organized to
resolve the ambiguity in the determination of the rotation period of HD 12098
is presented. The results of non oscillating Ap stars discovered in the survey

confirmed, the variability in HD 207561 will make it the first Am star showing
roAp type rapid variability.",2005-08-01T09:18:05Z
Baryonic acoustic oscillations in simulated galaxy redshift surveys,"Baryonic acoustic oscillations imprinted in the galaxy power spectrum provide
a promising tool for probing the cosmological distance scale and dark energy.
We present results from a suite of cosmological N-body simulations aimed at
investigating possible systematic errors in the recovery of cosmological
distances. We show the robustness of baryonic peaks against nonlinearity,
redshift distortions, and mild biases within the linear and quasilinear region
at various redshifts. While mildly biased tracers follow the matter power
spectrum well, redshift distortions do partially obscure baryonic features in
redshift space compared to real space. We calculate the statistical constraints
on cosmological distortions from N-body results and compare these to the
analytic results from a Fisher matrix formalism. We conclude that the angular
diameter distance will be constrained as well as our previous Fisher matrix
calculations while the Hubble parameter will be less constrained because of
nonlinear redshift distortions.",2005-07-14T14:44:57Z
Radio Detection of Cosmic Ray Air Showers with Codalema,"Studies of the radio detection of Extensive Air Showers is the goal of the

to EAS events on a event by event basis.",2005-05-20T14:50:53Z
AGN Unification and the X-ray Background,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) unification, which implies a large number of
obscured AGN, can explain the optical, infrared and X-ray content of deep
multiwavelength surveys. Here, we show that the same model also successfully
explains the spectral shape and intensity of the X-ray background. The simplest
possible unified model assumes a constant ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN,
independent of redshift or luminosity. With almost no free parameters, the
predicted X-ray background agrees remarkably well with observations. Both the
observed properties of deep AGN samples and the X-ray background can be
explained by the same model without invoking different evolution for obscured
and unobscured AGN. Recent observational evidence shows that the ratio of
obscured to unobscured AGN may depend on luminosity. An AGN unification model
that allows for such a dependence also fits the X-ray background spectrum, and
the predicted numbers counts in the 2-10 keV X-ray band are in good agreement
with observations. We present predictions for the source counts in hard X-rays
(10-100 keV), which indicate that future missions like the Black Hole Finder
will observe thousands of heavily obscured AGN.",2005-05-13T20:08:58Z
"Klein-Nishina Effects in the Spectra of Non-Thermal Sources Immersed in
  External Radiation Fields","We study Klein-Nishina (KN) effects in the spectrum produced by a steady
state, non-thermal source where rapidly accelerated electrons cool by emitting
synchrotron radiation and Compton upscattering ambient photons produced outside
the source. We focus on the case where the radiation density inside the source
exceeds that of the magnetic field. We show that the KN reduction in the
electron Compton cooling rate causes the steady-state electron spectrum to
harden at energies above \gamma_{KN}, where \gamma_{KN}= 1/4\epsilon_0 and
\epsilon_0=h\nu_0/m_ec^2 is the characteristic ambient photon energy. The
source synchrotron spectrum thus shows a high-energy ``bump'' or excess even
though the electron acceleration spectrum has no such excess. In contrast, the
low-energy Compton gamma-ray spectrum shows little distortion because the
electron hardening compensates for the KN decline in the scattering rate. For
sufficiently high electron energies, however, Compton cooling becomes so
inefficient that synchrotron cooling dominates -- an effect omitted in most
previous studies. The hardening of the electron distribution thus stops,
leading to a rapid decline in Compton gamma-ray emission, i.e., a strong
spectral break whose location does not depend on the maximum electron energy.
This break can limit the importance of Compton gamma-ray pair production on
ambient photons and implies that a source's synchrotron luminosity may exceed
its Compton luminosity even though the source magnetic field energy density is
smaller than the ambient radiation energy density. We discuss the importance of
these KN effects in blazars, micro-quasars, and pulsar binaries.",2005-04-18T14:20:42Z
"Non-Gaussianity of Large-Scale Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies
  beyond Perturbation Theory","We compute the fully non-linear Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropies on scales larger than the horizon at last-scattering in terms of
only the curvature perturbation, providing a generalization of the linear
Sachs-Wolfe effect at any order in perturbation theory. We show how to compute
the n-point connected correlation functions of the large-scale CMB anisotropies
for generic primordial seeds provided by standard slow-roll inflation as well
as the curvaton and other scenarios for the generation of cosmological
perturbations. As an application of our formalism, we compute the three- and
four-point connected correlation functions whose detection in future CMB
experiments might be used to assess the level of primordial non-Gaussianity,
giving the theoretical predictions for the parameters of quadratic and cubic
non-linearities f_NL and g_NL.",2005-06-17T12:57:58Z
Parameter Study of Star-Discs Encounters,"Interactions between disc-surrounded stars might play a vital role in the
formation of planetary systems. Here a first parameter study of the effects of
encounters on low-mass discs is presented. The dependence of the mass and
angular momentum transport on the periastron distance, the relative mass of the
encountering stars and eccentricity of the encounter is investigated in detail.
This is done for prograde and retrograde coplanar encounters as well as
non-coplanar encounters. For distant coplanar encounters our simulation results
agree with the analytical approximation of the angular momentum loss by
Ostriker(1994). However, for close or high-mass encounters, significant
differences to this approximation are found. This is especially so in the case
of retrograde encounters, where the analytical result predict no angular
momentum loss regardless of the periastron distance whereas the simulations
find up to ~ 20% loss for close encounters. For the non-coplanar case a more
complex dependency on the inclination between orbital path and disc plane is
found than for distant encounters. For the coplanar prograde case new fitting
formulae for the mass and angular momentum loss are obtained, which cover the
whole range from grazing to distant encounters. In addition, the final disc
size and the mass exchange between discs is examined, demonstrating that for
equal mass stars in encounters as close as 1.5 the disc radius, the disc size
only is reduced by approximately 10%.",2005-04-13T06:01:57Z
The Nature of Dark Matter,"The observed strong dark-to-luminous matter coupling suggests the existence
of a some functional relation between visible and DM sources which leads to
biased Einstein equations. We show that such a bias appears in the case when
the topological structure of the actual Universe at very large distances does
not match properly that of the Friedman space. We introduce a bias operator
$\rho_{DM} = B \rho_{vis}$ and show that the simple bias function $b \~1/r^{2}$
(the kernel of $B$) allows to account for all the variety of observed DM halos
in astrophysical systems. In galaxies such a bias forms the cored DM
distribution with the radius $R_{C}\sim R_{opt}$ (which explains the recently
observed strong correlation between $R_{C}$ and $R_{opt}$), while for a point
source it produces the logarithmic correction to the Newton's potential (which
explains the observed flat rotation curves in spirals). Finally, we show that
in the theory suggested the galaxy formation process leads to a specific
variation with time of all interaction constants and, in particular, of the
fine structure constant.",2005-05-06T17:37:36Z
On the Size Distribution of Close-In Extrasolar Giant Planets,"The precisions of extrasolar planet radius measurements are reaching the
point at which meaningful and discriminatory comparisons with theoretical
predictions are can be made. However, care must be taken to account for
selection effects in the transit surveys that detect the transiting planets for
which radius measurements are possible. Here I identify one such selection
effect, such that the number of planets with radius R_p detected in a
signal-to-noise ratio limited transit survey is proportional to R_p^alpha, with
alpha~4-6. In the presence of a dispersion sigma in the intrinsic distribution
of planet radii, this selection effect translates to bias b in the radii of
observed planets. Detected planets are, on average, larger by a fractional
amount b ~ alpha (sigma/<R_p>)^2 relative to the mean radius <R_p> of the
underlying distribution. I argue that the intrinsic dispersion in planetary
radii is likely to be in the range sigma = (0.05-0.13)R_J, where the lower
bound is that expected theoretically solely from the variance in stellar
insolation, and the upper bound is the 95% c.l. upper limit from the scatter in
observed radii. Assuming an arbitrary but plausible value of sigma/<R_p>~10%,
and thus b~6%, I infer a mean intrinsic radius of close-in massive extrasolar
planets of <R_p>=(1.03+/-0.01)R_J. This value reinforces the case for HD209458b
having an anomalously large radius, and may be inconsistent with coreless
models of irradiated giant planets.",2005-04-05T20:00:03Z
"The large scale structure of the Galactic magnetic field and High Energy
  Cosmic Ray anisotropy","The magnetic field in our Galaxy is not well known and is difficult to
measure. A spiral regular field in the disk between the Galactic arms is
favored by observations, however it is still controversial if the field
reverses from arm to arm. The parity of the field across the Galactic plane is
also not well established. In this letter we demonstrate that cosmic ray
protons in the energy range 10^18 to 10^19 eV, if accelerated near the center
of the Galaxy, can probe the large scale structure of the Galactic Magnetic
Field. In particular if the field is of even parity, and the spiral field
reverses direction from arm to arm, i.e. if it is bi-symmetric (BSS), ultra
high energy protons will predominantly come from the Southern Galactic
hemisphere, and predominantly from the Northern Galactic hemisphere if the
field is of even parity and axi-symmetric (ASS). There is no sensitivity to the
BSS or ASS configurations if the field is of odd parity.",2005-07-12T07:38:42Z
"Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of the Ultracompact Blue Dwarf Galaxy HS
  0822+3542: An Assembling Galaxy in a Local Void?","We present deep U, narrow-V, and I-band images of the ultracompact blue dwarf
galaxy HS 0822+3542, obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys / High
Resolution Channel of the Hubble Space Telescope. This object is extremely
metal-poor (12 + log(O/H) = 7.45) and resides in a nearby void. The images
resolve it into two physically separate components that were previously
described as star clusters in a single galaxy. The primary component is only
\~100 pc in maximum extent, and consists of starburst region surrounded by a
ring-like structure of relatively redder stars. The secondary component is ~50
pc in size and lies at a projected distance of ~80 pc away from the primary,
and is also actively star-forming. We estimate masses ~10^7 M(sol) and ~10^6
M(sol) for the two components, based on their luminosities, with an associated
dynamical timescale for the system of a few Myr. This timescale and the
structure of the components suggests that a collision between them triggered
their starbursts. The spectral energy distributions of both components can be
fitted by the combination of recent (few Myr old) starburst and an evolved
(several Gyr old) underlying stellar population, similar to larger blue compact
dwarf galaxies. This indicates that despite its metal deficiency the object is
not forming its first generation of stars. However, the small sizes and masses
of the two components suggests that HS 0822+3542 represents a dwarf galaxy in
the process of assembling from clumps of stars intermediate in size between
globular clusters and objects previously classified as galaxies. Its relatively
high ratio of neutral gas mass to stellar mass (~1) and high specific star
formation rate, log(SFR/M(sol) = -9.2, suggests that it is still converting
much of its gas to stars.",2005-07-20T21:24:04Z
"CMB Optical Depth Measurements: Past, Present, Future","The polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is encoded with
exactly the same cosmic information as the CMB's temperature anistropy.
However, polarization has the additional promise of accurately probing the
reionization history of the universe and potentially constraining, or
detecting, the primordial background of gravitational waves produced by
inflation. We demonstrate that these two CMB polarization goals are mutually
compatible. A polarimeter optimized to detect the inflationary gravitational
wave background signature in the polarization of the CMB is well situated to
detect the signatures of realistic first-light scenarios. We also discuss
current results and prospects for future CMB polarization experiments.",2005-08-11T19:14:18Z
The effect of neutrinos on the initial fireballs in gamma-ray bursts,"We investigate the fate of very compact, sudden energy depositions that may
lie at the origin of gamma-ray bursts. Following on from the work of Cavallo
and Rees (1978), we take account of the much higher energies now believed to be
involved. The main effect of this is that thermal neutrinos are present and
energetically important. We show that these may provide sufficient cooling to
tap most of the explosion energy. However, at the extreme energies usually
invoked for gamma-ray bursts, the neutrino opacity suffices to prevent dramatic
losses, provided that the heating process is sufficiently fast. In a generic
case, a few tens of percent of the initial fireball energy will escape as an
isotropic millisecond burst of thermal neutrinos with a temperature of about 60
MeV, which is detectable for nearby gamma-ray bursts and hypernovae. For
parameters we find most likely for gamma-ray burst fireballs, the dominant
processes are purely leptonic, and thus the baryon loading of the fireball does
not affect our conclusions.",2005-05-26T12:28:13Z
The length of stellar bars in SB galaxies and N-body simulations,"We have investigated the accuracy and reliability of six methods used to
determine the length of stellar bars in galaxies or N-body simulations. All
these methods use ellipse fitting and Fourier decomposition of the surface
brightness. We have applied them to N-body simulations that include stars, gas,
star formation, and feedback. Stellar particles were photometrically calibrated
to make B and K-band mock images. Dust absorption is also included. We discuss
the advantages and drawbacks of each method, the effects of projection and
resolution, as well as the uncertainties introduced by the presence of dust.
The use of N-body simulations allows us to compare the location of Ultra
Harmonic Resonance (UHR or 4/1) and corotation (CR) with measured bar lengths.
We show that the minimum of ellipticity located just outside the bulk of the
bar is correlated with the corotation, whereas the location of the UHR can be
approximated using the phase of the fitted ellipses or the phase of the m=2
Fourier development of the surface brightness. We give evidence that the
classification of slow/fast bars, based on the ratio R = Rcr/Rbar could
increase from 1 (fast bar) to 1.4 (slow bar) just by a change of method. We
thus conclude that one has to select the right bar-length estimator depending
on the application, since these various estimators do not define the same
physical area.",2005-03-18T02:47:10Z
"Late internal shock model for bright X-ray flares in Gamma-ray Burst
  afterglows and GRB 011121","We explore two possible models which might give rise to bright X-ray flares
in GRBs afterglows. One is an external forward-reverse shock model, in which
the shock parameters of forward/reverse shocks are taken to be quite different.
The other is a so called ""late internal shock model"", which requires a
refreshed unsteady relativistic outflow generated after the prompt $\gamma-$ray
emission. In the forward-reverse shock model, after the time $t_\times$ at
which the RS crosses the ejecta, the flux declines more slowly than
$(t_\oplus/t_\times)^{-(2+\beta)}$, where $t_\oplus$ denotes the observer's
time and $\beta$ is the spectral index of the X-ray emission. In the ``late
internal shock model"", decaying slopes much steeper than $(t_\oplus/t_{\rm e,
\oplus})^{-(2+\beta)}$ are possible if the central engine shuts down after
$t_{\rm e, \oplus}$ and the observed variability timescale of the X-ray flare
is much shorter than $t_{\rm e, \oplus}$.
  The sharp decline of the X-ray flares detected in GRB 011121, XRF 050406, GRB
050502b, and GRB 050730 rules out the external forward-reverse shock model
directly and favors the ""late internal shock model"". These X-ray flares could
thus hint that the central engine operates again and a new unsteady
relativistic outflow is generated just a few minutes after the intrinsic hard
burst.",2005-06-08T00:21:09Z
Models of class II methanol masers based on improved molecular data,"The class II masers of methanol are associated with the early stages of
formation of high-mass stars. Modelling of these dense, dusty environments has
demonstrated that pumping by infrared radiation can account for the observed
masers. Collisions with other molecules in the ambient gas also play a
significant role, but have not been well modelled in the past. Here we examine
the effects on the maser models of newly available collision rate coefficients
for methanol. The new collision data does not alter which transitions become
masers in the models, but does influence their brightness and the conditions
under which they switch on and off. At gas temperatures above 100 K the effects
are broadly consistent with a reduction in the overall collision cross-section.
This means, for example, that a slightly higher gas density than identified
previously can account for most of the observed masers in W3(OH). We have also
examined the effects of including more excited state energy levels in the
models, and find that these play a significant role only at dust temperatures
above 300 K. An updated list of class II methanol maser candidates is
presented.",2005-04-08T01:08:18Z
"Aten-Alinda orbital evolution: the example of possible interacting
  orbits","Minor planets 887 Alinda and 2062 Aten are typical near Earth asteroids

collision near Earth orbit. It is determine the target of present research --
to investigate interactions between these objects in more details. Orbits m.p.
887 and 2062 are crossed near pericenter and apocenter accordingly. So possible
interval of the interaction of these objects is repeated through the
significant time interval and has relatively small duration. On the strength of
several reasons, orbits of fragments of the disastrous collision can have no an
exact intersection. Besides, when integrating on the greater gap in the past
increases a role of the uncertainty of initial values of elements of orbits.
These factors determine a probabilistic nature of the result as well as need of
modeling of the disastrous process. However, on the strength of the specific
spatial location of orbits, result has highly determined numeric expression -

"The double-mode nature of the HADS star GSC 00144-03031 and the Petersen
  diagram of the class","The double--mode pulsation of GSC 00144-03031 has been detected when
searching for COROT targets. A very large dataset composed of 4722 photometric
measurements was collected at six observatories in Europe and America. There is
no hint of the excitation of additional modes (down to 0.6 mmag) and therefore
GSC 00144-03031 seems to be a pure double--mode pulsator, with a very short
fundamental radial mode (P=84 min). From Stromgren photometry and evolutionary
tracks it appears to be a Pop. I star with M=1.75 solar masses, located in the
middle of the instability strip, close to the Zero--Age Main Sequence. We also
discovered other new double--mode pulsators in the databases of large--scale
projects: OGLE BW2_V142, OGLE BW1_V207, ASAS3 094303-1707.3, ASAS3
000116-6037.0, NSVS 3234596 and NSVS 3324715. An observational Petersen diagram
is presented and explained by means of new models. A common sequence connecting
Pop. I stars from the shortest to the longest periods is proposed and the
spreads in the period ratios are ascribed to different metallicities (at the
shortest periods) and to different masses (at the longest ones). The paper is
based on data collected at S. Pedro Martir and Sierra Nevada Observatories and
on the contributions from several amateur astronomers.",2005-06-13T10:15:05Z
"Rotational velocities of the giants in symbiotic stars: I. D'-type
  symbiotics","We have measured the rotational velocities (v.sini) of the mass donors in a
number of D'--type symbiotic stars, using the cross-correlation function
method. Four from five D' symbiotic stars with known v.sini, appeared to be
very fast rotators compared with the catalogues of v.sini for the corresponding
spectral types. At least three of these stars rotate at a substantial fraction
(>=0.5) of the critical velocity. This means that at least in D'-type
symbiotics the cool components rotate faster than isolated giants. If these
binary stars are synchronized, their orbital periods should be relatively short
(4-60 days). We also briefly discuss the possible origin of the rapid rotation
and its connection with mass loss and dust formation.",2005-07-25T08:44:02Z
SMC: Stellar Populations through deep CMDs,"We present deep color-magnitud diagrams (CMDs) reaching the oldest
main-sequence turnoffs for 12 fields in the SMC. The {\it B}-band and {\it
R}-band observations were performed using the 100-inch Ir\'en\'ee du Pont
telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, during four different campaigns
(2001-2004). Our fields cover a wide range of galactocentric distance ranging
from $\sim1\deg$ to $\sim4\deg$ from the center of the galaxy and are located a
different position angles. Photometry was carried out using DAOPHOT
II/ALLSTAR/ALLFRAME. Teramo isochrones have been overlapped. All our
unprecedented deep ground-based CMDs reach the old MS turnoffs with very good
photometric accuracy. They clearly show stellar population gradients as a
function of both galactocentric distance and position angle. The most
conspicuous difference involves the young population (age$<$1 Gyr): the young
MS is much more populated on the eastern fields, located on the SMC wing area,
than on the western fields located at similar galactocentric radius. In
addition, the main stellar population gets progresively older on average as we
go to larger galactocentric radius.",2005-06-21T12:28:47Z
Properties of Central Caustics in Planetary Microlensing,"To maximize the number of planet detections, current microlensing follow-up
observations are focusing on high-magnification events which have a higher
chance of being perturbed by central caustics. In this paper, we investigate
the properties of central caustics and the perturbations induced by them. We
derive analytic expressions of the location, size, and shape of the central
caustic as a function of the star-planet separation, $s$, and the planet/star
mass ratio, $q$, under the planetary perturbative approximation and compare the
results with those based on numerical computations. While it has been known
that the size of the planetary caustic is \propto \sqrt{q}, we find from this
work that the dependence of the size of the central caustic on $q$ is linear,
i.e., \propto q, implying that the central caustic shrinks much more rapidly
with the decrease of $q$ compared to the planetary caustic. The central-caustic
size depends also on the star-planet separation. If the size of the caustic is
defined as the separation between the two cusps on the star-planet axis
(horizontal width), we find that the dependence of the central-caustic size on
the separation is \propto (s+1/s). While the size of the central caustic
depends both on $s$ and q, its shape defined as the vertical/horizontal width
ratio, R_c, is solely dependent on the planetary separation and we derive an
analytic relation between R_c and s. Due to the smaller size of the central
caustic combined with much more rapid decrease of its size with the decrease of
q, the effect of finite source size on the perturbation induced by the central
caustic is much more severe than the effect on the perturbation induced by the
planetary caustic. Abridged.",2005-05-18T06:35:05Z
"The Temperature Distribution of Dense Molecular Gas in the Center of NGC
  253","[abridged] We present interferometric maps of ammonia (NH3) of the nearby
starburst galaxy NGC 253 [star formation rate: ~2.8 Mo yr^(-1)]. The
observations have been taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and
include the para-NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and the ortho-NH3 (3,3) and (6,6) inversion
lines. Six major complexes of dense ammonia are identified, three of them on
either side of the starburst center, out to projected galactocentric radii of
\~250 pc. [...] The application of radiative transfer large velocity gradient
models reveals that the bulk of the ammonia molecules is embedded in a
one-temperature gas phase. Kinetic temperatures of this gas are ~200 and 140 K
toward the south-west and north-east [of the nucleus of NGC 253], respectively.
The temperatures under which ammonia was formed in the past are with >~30 K
also warmer toward the south-west than toward the north-east (~15-20 K). This
is indicated by the ortho-to-para ammonia ratio which is ~1 and 1.5-2.5 toward
the south-west and north-east, respectively. Ammonia column densities in the
brightest complexes are in the range of 6-11x10^(14) cm^(-2), which adds up to
a total ammonia mass of ~20 Mo, about evenly distributed toward both sides of
the nucleus. [...] Toward the center of NGC 253, NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and (6,6) is
detected in absorption against an unresolved continuum source. At the same
location, however, ammonia (3,3) is found in emission which indicates maser
activity. This would be the first detected extragalactic NH3 maser. Evidence
for an expanding shell in the south-western complex is provided. [...] The
shell and X-ray properties can be reproduced by the energy input of a highly
obscured young stellar cluster with a mass of ~10^5 Mo which also heats the
dense gas.",2005-05-07T14:08:06Z
"Reduced magnetic braking and the magnetic capture model for the
  formation of ultra-compact binaries","A binary in which a slightly evolved star starts mass transfer to a neutron
star can evolve towards ultra-short orbital periods under the influence of
magnetic braking. This is called magnetic capture. In a previous paper we
showed that ultra-short periods are only reached for an extremely small range
of initial binary parameters, in particular orbital period and donor mass. Our
conclusion was based on one specific choice for the law of magnetic braking,
and for the loss of mass and angular momentum during mass transfer. In this
paper we show that for less efficient magnetic braking it is impossible to
evolve to ultra-short periods, independent of the amount of mass and associated
angular momentum lost from the binary.",2005-06-16T09:10:43Z
Silicon Tetrafluoride on Io,"Silicon tetrafluoride (SiF4) is observed in terrestrial volcanic gases and is
predicted to be the major F - bearing species in low temperature volcanic gases
on Io (Schaefer and Fegley, 2005b). SiF4 gas is also a potential indicator of
silica-rich crust on Io. We used F/S ratios in terrestrial and extraterrestrial
basalts, and gas/lava enrichment factors for F and S measured at terrestrial
volcanoes to calculate equilibrium SiF4/SO2 ratios in volcanic gases on Io. We
conclude that SiF4 can be produced at levels comparable to the observed
NaCl/SO2 gas ratio. We also considered potential loss processes for SiF4 in
volcanic plumes and in Io's atmosphere including ion-molecule reactions,
electron chemistry, photochemistry, reactions with the major atmospheric
constituents, and condensation. Photochemical destruction (tchem ~ 266 days)
and/or condensation as Na2SiF6 (s) appear to be the major sinks for SiF4. We
recommend searching for SiF4 with infrared spectroscopy using its 9.7 micron
band as done on Earth.",2005-06-01T20:21:32Z
"Wave propagation in a weak gravitational field and the validity of the
  thin lens approximation","Wave effects can be important for the gravitational lensing of gravitational
waves. In such a case, wave optics must be used in stead of geometric optics.
We consider a plane wave entering a lens object and solve numerically the wave
equation for three lens models: the uniform density sphere, the singular
isothermal sphere, and the Hernquist model. By comparing our numerical
solutions with the analytical solutions under the thin lens approximation, we
evaluate the error of this approximation. The results show that the relative
error of the thin lens approximation is small if the geometrical thickness of
the lens is much smaller than the distance between the lens and the observer.",2005-05-02T13:31:01Z
A Jovian-mass Planet in Microlensing Event OGLE-2005-BLG-071,"We report the discovery of a several-Jupiter mass planetary companion to the
primary lens star in microlensing event OGLE-2005-BLG-071. Precise (<1%)
photometry at the peak of the event yields an extremely high signal-to-noise
ratio detection of a deviation from the light curve expected from an isolated
lens. The planetary character of this deviation is easily and unambiguously
discernible from the gross features of the light curve. Detailed modeling
yields a tightly-constrained planet-star mass ratio of q=m_p/M=0.0071+/-0.0003.
This is the second robust detection of a planet with microlensing,
demonstrating that the technique itself is viable and that planets are not rare
in the systems probed by microlensing, which typically lie several kpc toward
the Galactic center.",2005-05-20T20:00:15Z
Measuring diffuse neutrino fluxes with IceCube,"In this paper the sensitivity of a future kilometer-sized neutrino detector
to detect and measure the diffuse flux of high energy neutrinos is evaluated.
Event rates in established detection channels, such as muon events from charged
current muon neutrino interactions or cascade events from electron neutrino and
tau neutrino interactions, are calculated using a detailed Monte Carlo
simulation. Neutrino fluxes as expected from prompt charm decay in the
atmosphere or from astrophysical sources such as Active Galactic Nuclei are
modeled assuming power laws. The ability to measure the normalization and slope
of these spectra is then analyzed.
  It is found that the cascade channel generally has a high sensitivity for the
detection and characterization of the diffuse flux, when compared to what is
expected for the upgoing- and downgoing-muon channels. A flux at the level of
the Waxman-Bahcall upper bound should be detectable in all channels separately
while a combination of the information of the different channels will allow
detection of a flux more than one order of magnitude lower. Neutrinos from the
prompt decay of charmed mesons in the atmosphere should be detectable in future
measurements for all but the lowest predictions.",2005-05-25T10:03:10Z
The Mass of a Millisecond Pulsar,"We report on nearly two years of timing observations of the low-mass binary
millisecond pulsar, PSR J1909-3744 with the Caltech-Parkes-Swinburne Recorder
II (CPSR2), a new instrument that gives unprecedented timing precision. Daily
observations give a weighted rms residual of 74 ns, indicating an extremely low
level of systematic error. We have greatly improved upon the previous parallax
and proper motion measurements of PSR J1909-3744, yielding a distance of
$1.14^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ kpc and transverse velocity of $(200^{+7}_{-6})$ km
s$^{-1}$. The system's orbital eccentricity is just 1.35(12)$\times10^{-7}$,
the smallest yet recorded. Since their discovery, the masses of the rapidly
rotating millisecond pulsars have remained a mystery, with the recycling
hypothesis arguing for heavy objects, and the accretion-induced collapse of a
white dwarf more consistent with neutron stars less than the Chandrashkar
limit. Fortuitously, PSR J1909-3744 is an edge-on system, and our data have
allowed the measurement of the range and shape of the Shapiro delay to high
accuracy, giving the first precise determination of a millisecond pulsar mass
to date, $m_p = (1.438 \pm 0.024) M_\odot$. The mass of PSR J1909-3744 is at
the upper edge of the range observed in mildly recycled pulsars in double
neutron star systems, consistent with the the recycling hypothesis. It appears
that the production of millisecond pulsars is possible with the accretion of
less than $0.2 M_\odot$.",2005-07-18T20:22:24Z
"A simple method to construct exact density-potential pairs from a
  homeoidal expansion","We start from a study of the density-potential relation for classical
homeoids in terms of an asymptotic expansion for small deviations from
spherical symmetry. We then show that such expansion is a useful device that
allows us to construct a variety of exact density-potential pairs with
spheroidal, toroidal, or triaxial shapes for which the deviation from spherical
symmetry is finite. As concrete analytical applications, we describe: (1) The
construction of a family of toroidal axisymmetric density-potential pairs one
of which is associated with a perfectly flat rotation curve (for a member of
this family, the supporting two-integral phase-space distribution function is
obtained in closed form); (2) The determination of the aperture velocity
dispersion in a wide class of two-integral axisymmetric models not stratified
on homeoids with central black hole, which may be useful for the discussion of
the dynamical contributions to the characteristics of the Fundamental Plane of
early-type galaxies; and (3) For such class of models, the construction of the
v/sigma-ellipticity relation, often considered to assess the role of rotation
in the structure of elliptical galaxies.",2005-04-04T11:59:22Z
"Probing the inner 200 AU of low-mass protostars with the Submillimeter
  Array: Dust and organic molecules in NGC1333-IRAS2A","The Submillimeter Array has opened a new window to study the innermost warm
and dense regions of the envelopes and disks around deeply embedded protostars.
This paper presents high-angular resolution (< 2'') submillimeter observations
of the class 0 young stellar object NGC1333-IRAS2A. Dust continuum emission and
lines of complex organic molecules such as CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO, high excitation
CH3OH transitions, deuterated methanol CH3OD as well as lines of CO, HCN,
H13CN, SO and SO2 are detected on < 200 AU scales. The observations are
interpreted using detailed radiative transfer models of the physical and
chemical structure, consistent with both single-dish and interferometer data.
The continuum emission is explained by an extended envelope and a compact but
resolved component, presumably a circumstellar disk with a diameter of 200-300
AU and a mass of a few times 0.01-0.1 M_sun. If related to the rotation of the
envelope, then the size of this disk suggests a centrifugal barrier of 200-300
AU, which implies that the temperature in the envelope does not increase above
100 K. Its large size also suggests that the build-up of disks proceeds rapidly
throughout the early protostellar stages. The smaller (< 100 AU) disks found
around other deeply embedded protostars may be a result of tidal truncation.
The high-resolution observations of SO can be explained with a simple constant
abundance, ~1E-9, constrained through single-dish observations, whereas those
of H13CN and the organic species require high abundances, increased by one to
two orders of magnitude, or an additional compact source of emission at small
scales. The compact molecular emission could originate in a hot core region of
the inner envelope, but a more likely reservoir is the circumstellar disk.",2005-06-28T00:44:34Z
"Perturbations of the Quintom Models of Dark Energy and the Effects on
  Observations","We study in this paper the perturbations of the quintom dark energy model and
the effects of quintom perturbations on the current observations. Quintom
describes a scenario of dark energy where the equation of state gets across the
cosmological constant boundary $w = -1$ during evolution. We present a new
method to show that the conventional dark energy models based on single
k-essence field and perfect fluid cannot act as quintom due to the
singularities and classical instabilities of perturbations around $w = -1$. One
needs to add extra degrees of freedom for successful quintom model buildings.
There are no singularities or classical instabilities in perturbations of
realistic quintom models and they are potentially distinguishable from the
cosmological constant. Basing on the realistic quintom models in this paper we
provide one way to include the perturbations for dark energy models with
parametrized equation of state across -1. Compare with those assuming no dark
energy perturbations, we find that the parameter space which allows the
equation of state to get across -1 will be enlarged in general when including
the perturbations.",2005-07-20T17:25:40Z
"The Molecular Condensations Ahead of Herbig-Haro Objects. III. Radiative
  and dynamical perturbations of the HH 2 condensation","We have carried out an extensive observational study (from BIMA data) and
made a preliminary theoretical investigation of the molecular gas around HH2.
The molecular maps show a very complex morphological, kinematical and chemical
structure. The overall main conclusion of this work confirms the findings of
Paper I and II, by demonstrating that in addition to the strong photochemical
effects caused by penetration of the UV photons from HH2 into molecular cloud,
a range of complex radiative and dynamical interactions occur. Thus, despite
the apparent `quiescent' nature of the molecular cloud ahead of HH2, the
kinematical properties observed within the field of view suggest that it is
possibly being driven out by powerful winds from the VLA 1 protostar.",2005-04-15T13:41:58Z
What we do and do not know about the s-process,"AGB stars are the source for the main component of the $s$-process. Here we
discuss both the properties which are reasonably well known and those which
still suffer from substantial uncertainties. In the former case, we are fairly
sure that the $s$-process contribution from AGB stars comes from masses between
about 1 and 3 $\msun$, and the dominant neutron source is the
$^{13}$C$(\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O reaction. In the latter category remains the
formation mechanism for the $^{13}$C-pocket. Attempts at including rotation
seem to inhibit neutron capture reactions. Explaining the observations seems to
require a spread in the size of the $^{13}$C-pocket so some stochastic process,
such as rotation, must be involved.",2005-05-19T23:41:16Z
"alpha-Enhanced Integrated Lick/IDS Spectral Indices and Milky Way and
  M31 Globular Clusters and Early-type Galaxies","All 25 Lick/IDS spectral indices have been computed for the integrated light
of simple stellar populations over broad ranges of age and metallicity and with
effects from horizontal-branch stars fully implemented. For Balmer indices a
significant response was noted for Hgamma and Hdelta when a-elements are
enhanced, but Hbeta is rather a-insensitive. We also find that our 5 Gyr and 12
Gyr models of Hgamma and Hdelta overlap in the metal-poor regime because of
changing populations of blue horizontal-branch stars. Furthermore, for
populations younger than 1 Gyr, Balmer lines become weaker in the metal-poor
regime because the main-sequence turnoff is hotter than 10,000 K. We present
models at fixed [Fe/H] (rather than fixed heavy element mass fraction Z), and
compare to Milky Way globular clusters that have independently estimated mean
[Fe/H] and [a/Fe]. Comparison of our models with observations of Milky Way and
M31 globular clusters in index-index space are favorable, tracing the
observations at a model age of 12 Gyr without any zero-point shifts that are
needed by some other models. Contrary to the literature values, the Milky Way
globular cluster NGC 6553 appears more metal-rich than NGC 6528 from metal
indices. We present Hdelta and Hgamma Lick/IDS indices for the Lick/IDS sample
of galaxies. We confirm the well-known enhancement of Mg and Na relative to Fe
and Ca among early-type galaxies, and its increase with increasing velocity
dispersion. There are distinct differences between globular clusters and
galaxies in diagrams involving CN1 and CN2, hinting that the globular cluster
environment may be a special one in terms of the amount of N incorporated into
stars. (abridged)",2005-04-22T19:58:33Z
On the nature of the S stars in the Galactic Center,"Davies and King have suggested that the bright stars observed on short-period
orbits about Sgr A* (``S stars'') are old, low-mass stripped AGB stars rather
than young, high-mass main-sequence stars. If the observationally inferred
effective temperatures and luminosities of these stars are correct, however,
then DK have grossly overestimated the post-AGB lifetimes and hence
underestimated the production rate in steady state. In fact, the total mass in
stars stripped over the age of the Galaxy would exceed that of the stellar cusp
bound to Sgr A*. We take issue also with Davies & King's estimates of the
energetics involved in capturing the stars onto their present orbits.",2005-04-04T19:03:23Z
"Remarks on the formulation of the cosmological constant/dark energy
  problems","Associated with the cosmic acceleration are the old and new cosmological
constant problems, recently put into the more general context of the dark
energy problem. In broad terms, the old problem is related to an unexpected
order of magnitude of this component while the new problem is related to this
magnitude being of the same order of the matter energy density during the
present epoch of cosmic evolution. Current plans to measure the equation of
state certainly constitute an important approach; however, as we discuss, this
approach is faced with serious feasibility challenges and is limited in the
type of conclusive answers it could provide. Therefore, is it really too early
to seek actively for new tests and approaches to these problems? In view of the
difficulty of this endeavor, we argue here that a good place to start is by
questioning some of the assumptions underlying the formulation of these
problems and finding new ways to put this questioning to the test. First, we
calculate how much fine tuning the cosmic coincidence problem represents. Next,
we discuss the potential of some cosmological probes such as gravitational
lensing to identify novel tests to probe dark energy questions and assumptions.
Then, motivated by some theorems in General Relativity, we discuss if the full
identification of the cosmological constant with vacuum energy is
unquestionable. Also, we point out the relevance of experiments at the
interface of astrophysics and quantum field theory, such as the Casimir effect
in gravitational and cosmological contexts. We conclude that challenging some
of the assumptions underlying the cosmological constant problems and putting
them to the test may prove useful and necessary to make progress on these
questions. (Abridged)",2005-04-19T15:44:05Z
Spherical Collapse Model And Dark Energy(II),"This is a second paper of a series of two. In this paper, we directly correct
the problem pointed out in the first paper of this series, dark energy does not
cluster on the scale of galaxy clusters, but the current describing the flowing
of dark energies outside the clusters is ignored in almost all the previous
papers. We set up and solve a first order differential equation which describes
the evolution of the clusters in a back ground universe containing dark
energies.
  From the solution we extract the key parameters of the model and find them
depending on the equation of state coefficients of dark energies rather
non-trivially. We then apply the results in Press-Scheter theory and calculate
the number density of galaxy clusters and its evolutions, we find the
observable quantities are strongly affected by the equation of state
coefficients of dark energies.",2005-05-09T13:51:59Z
X-ray Light Curves and Accretion Disk Structure of EX Hydrae,"We present X-ray light curves for the cataclysmic variable EX Hydrae obtained
with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer and the Extreme
Ultraviolet Explorer Deep Survey photometer. We confirm earlier results on the
shape and amplitude of the binary light curve and discuss a new feature: the
phase of the minimum in the binary light curve, associated with absorption by
the bulge on the accretion disk, increases with wavelength. We discuss several
scenarios that could account for this trend and conclude that, most likely, the
ionization state of the bulge gas is not constant, but rather decreases with
binary phase. We also conclude that photoionization of the bulge by radiation
originating from the white dwarf is not the main source of ionization, but that
it is heated by shocks originating from the interaction between the inflowing
material from the companion and the accretion disk. The findings in this paper
provide a strong test for accretion disk models in close binary systems.",2005-04-19T14:08:41Z

"The SAURON project - IV. The mass-to-light ratio, the virial mass
  estimator and the fundamental plane of elliptical and lenticular galaxies","We investigate with unprecedented accuracy the correlations between the
dynamical mass-to-light ratio M/L and other global observables of E and S0
galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild
dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field
stellar kinematics. We find a tight correlation of the form
(M/L)=(3.80+/-0.14)*(sigma/200 km/s)^(0.84+/-0.07) between the dynamical M/L
(in the I-band) and the luminosity-weighted second moment (sigma) of the
line-of-sight velocity-distribution within Re. The observed rms scatter in M/L
for our sample is 18%, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is ~13%. The
(M/L)-sigma relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight
correlations between sigma and other galaxy global observables. The comparison
of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane
(FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the `tilt' of the FP of
early-type galaxies, is due to a real M/L variation, while structural and
orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. The virial mass is a reliable
estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies. The best-fitting
virial relation has the form (M/L)_vir=(5.0+/-0.1)*Re*sigma^2/(L*G). The
comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)_pop inferred from the analysis
of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in
early-type galaxies of ~30% of the total mass inside one Re. (Abridged)",2005-05-03T17:03:25Z
"Long-Term Evolution of Massive Black Hole Binaries. II. Binary Evolution
  in Low-Density Galaxies","We use direct-summation N-body integrations to follow the evolution of binary
black holes at the centers of galaxy models with large, constant-density cores.
Particle numbers as large as 400K are considered. The results are compared with
the predictions of loss-cone theory, under the assumption that the supply of
stars to the binary is limited by the rate at which they can be scattered into
the binary's influence sphere by gravitational encounters. The agreement
between theory and simulation is quite good; in particular, we are able to
quantitatively explain the observed dependence of binary hardening rate on N.
We do not verify the recent claim of Chatterjee, Hernquist & Loeb (2003) that
the hardening rate of the binary stabilizes when N exceeds a particular value,
or that Brownian wandering of the binary has a significant effect on its
evolution. When scaled to real galaxies, our results suggest that massive black
hole binaries in gas-poor nuclei would be unlikely to reach gravitational-wave
coalescence in a Hubble time.",2005-07-11T16:03:18Z
"Atmospheric Profiles at the Southern Pierre Auger Observatory and their
  Relevance to Air Shower Measurement","The dependence of atmospheric conditions on altitude and time have to be
known at the site of an air shower experiment for accurate reconstruction of
extensive air showers and their simulations. The height-profile of atmospheric
depth is of particular interest as it enters directly into the reconstruction
of longitudinal shower development and of the primary energy and mass of cosmic
rays. For the southern part of the Auger Observatory, the atmosphere has been
investigated in a number of campaigns with meteorological radio soundings and
with continuous measurements of ground-based weather stations. Focussing on
atmospheric depth and temperature profiles, temporal variations are described

"Impact of a new Cherenkov light parameterisation on the reconstruction

depending on the shower geometry with respect to the detector - a
non-negligible contribution from additionally produced Cherenkov light. This
Cherenkov contribution has to be accounted for to determine primary parameters
properly. In comparison to the previous ansatz used by other experiments, the
impact of a new analytical description of Cherenkov light production in EAS on
the Auger event reconstruction is investigated.",2005-07-11T13:26:53Z
A Morphological Study of Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxies,"We present a comprehensive study of the morphological properties of 42
gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope in
the optical band. The purpose of this study is to understand the relation of
GRBs to their macro-environments, and to compare the GRB-selected galaxies to
other high redshift samples. We perform both qualitative and quantitative
analyses by categorizing the galaxies according to their visual properties, and
by examining their surface brightness profiles. We find that all of the
galaxies have approximately exponential profiles, indicative of galactic disks,
and have a median scale length of about 1.7 kpc. Inspection of the visual
morphologies reveals a high fraction of merging and interacting systems, with
\~30% showing clear signs of interaction, and an additional ~30% exhibiting
irregular and asymmetric structure which may be the result of recent mergers;
these fractions are independent of redshift and galaxy luminosity. On the other
hand, the three GRB host galaxies for which submillimeter and radio emission
has been detected are isolated and compact, unlike the luminous
submillimeter-selected galaxies. The fraction of mergers appears to be elevated
compared to other high redshift samples, particularly for the low luminosities
of GRB hosts (M_B ~ -16 to -21 mag). This suggests that merging and interacting
galaxies undergoing a burst of star formation may be an efficient site for the
production of GRB progenitors. Finally, we show that GRB hosts clearly follow
the size-luminosity relation present in other galaxy samples, but thanks to
absorption redshifts they help extend this relation to lower luminosities.",2005-08-02T01:24:35Z
The Lithium Content of the Galactic Halo Stars,"Thanks to the accurate determination of the baryon density of the universe by
the recent cosmic microwave background experiments, updated predictions of the
standard model of Big Bang nucleosynthesis now yield the initial abundance of
the primordial light elements with an unprecedented precision. In the case of
$^7$Li, the CMB+SBBN value is significantly higher than the generally reported
abundances for Pop II stars along the so-called Spite plateau. In view of the
crucial importance of this disagreement which has cosmological, galactic and
stellar implications, we decided to tackle the most critical issues of the
problem by revisiting a large sample of literature Li data in halo stars that

The Largest Scale We Can Detect in the Universe and the Inflation,"From the damping of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
  (CMB) anisotropy power spectrum at large scale and the recent accelerating
expansion of the Universe, we find that, there may be a largest scale which we
can detect in the Universe. From this, we can get the inflation parameters as
spectrum index $n_s$, e-fold
  $N$, Hubble parameter $H$, the ratio of tensor and scalar $r$, the lasting
time of reheating time $\alpha$ for special inflation models. We do them in
three inflation models, and find that all the results fit very well with the
observations and the inflation theory.",2005-07-30T20:23:31Z
"Star formation rate density and the stochastic background of
  gravitational waves","There is in the literature a number of papers addressing the stochastic
background of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by an ensemble of
astrophysical sources. The main ingredient in such studies is the so called
star formation rate density (SFRD), which gives the density of stars formed per
unit time. Some authors argue, however, that there is, in the equation that
determines the amplitude of the stochastic background of GWs, an additional
(1+z) term dividing the SFRD, which would account for the effect of cosmic
expansion onto the time variable. We argue here that the inclusion of this
additional term is wrong. In order to clarify where the inclusion of the (1+z)
term is really necessary, we briefly discuss the calculation of event rates in
the study of GRBs (gamma ray bursts) from cosmological origin.",2005-07-01T13:45:08Z
"Cataclysmic variables from a ROSAT/2MASS selection I: Four new
  intermediate polars","We report the first results from a new search for cataclysmic variables (CVs)
using a combined X-ray (ROSAT) / infrared (2MASS) target selection that
discriminates against background AGN. Identification spectra were obtained at
the Isaac Newton Telescope for a total of 174 targets, leading to the discovery
of 12 new CVs. Initially devised to find short-period low-mass-transfer CVs,
this selection scheme has been very successful in identifying new intermediate
polars. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations identify four of
the new CVs as intermediate polars: 1RXSJ063631.9+353537 (Porb~201min,
Pspin=1008.3408s or 930.5829), 1RXSJ070407.9+262501 (Porb~250min,
Pspin=480.708s), 1RXSJ173021.5-055933 (Porb=925.27min, Pspin=128.0s), and
1RXSJ180340.0+401214 (Porb=160.21min, Pspin=1520.51s). RXJ1730, also a
moderately bright hard X-ray source in the INTEGRAL/IBIS Galactic plane survey,
resembles the enigmatic AE Aqr. It is likely that its white dwarf is not
rotating at the spin equilibrium period, and the system may represent a
short-lived phase in CV evolution.",2005-04-21T07:52:02Z
INTEGRAL & RXTE Power Spectra of Cygnus X-1,"We evaluate 0.03-20 Hz power spectra of the bright black hole binary Cyg X-1
obtained from non-deconvolved INTEGRAL-ISGRI event data. The ISGRI power
spectra are compared to contemporary RXTE-PCA ones in the same hard X-ray
energy band of 15-70 keV. They agree well in shape. Since the ISGRI power
spectrum of Cyg X-1 is not background corrected it lies about an order of
magnitude below the PCA values. In 2003 a soft outburst of Cyg X-1 occurred.
  From the RXTE-ASM and Ryle radio long term lightcurves and the RXTE spectra
we see a canonical ``hard state -- intermediate state -- soft state''
evolution. We discuss the evolution of the power spectra in the 15-70 keV range
which so far is much less well studied than that at softer energies. We
interpret our results regarding the origin of certain variability components.",2005-04-18T23:01:44Z
"Detection of satellite remnants in the Galactic Halo with Gaia - I. The
  effect of the Galactic background, observational errors and sampling","We address the problem of identifying remnants of satellite galaxies in the
halo of our galaxy with Gaia data. The remnants have to be extracted from a
very large data set (of order 10^9 stars) in the presence of observational
errors and against a background population of Galactic stars. We address this
issue through a numerical simulation of the Gaia catalogue with a realistic
number of entries. The Galaxy model includes separate light distributions and
kinematics for the bulge, disc and stellar halo. Our catalogue contains
3.5x10^8 stars. We perform tree code 10^6-body simulations of satellite dwarf
galaxies in orbit around a rigid mass model of the Galaxy. The shrinking
satellite cores and tidal tails are added to the Monte Carlo simulation of the
Gaia catalogue. When combining the Milky Way and dwarf galaxy models we include
the complication that the luminosity function of the satellite is probed at
various depths as a function of position along the tidal tails. The combined
models are converted to a synthetic Gaia catalogue using a detailed model for
the expected astrometric and radial velocity errors, depending on magnitude,
colour and sky position of the stars. We explore the feasibility of detecting
tidal streams in the halo using the energy versus angular momentum plane. A
straightforward search in this plane will be very challenging. The background
population and the observational errors make it difficult to detect tidal
streams as discrete structures in the E-Lz plane. The propagation of
observational errors leads to apparent caustic structures in the integrals of
motion space that may be mistaken for physical entities. Any practical search
strategy will have to use a combination of pre-selection of high-quality data
and complementary searches using the photometric data from Gaia. (abridged)",2005-04-11T14:26:10Z
The Dipole Anisotropy of the 2 Micron All-Sky Redshift Survey,"We estimate the acceleration on the Local Group (LG) from the Two Micron All
Sky Redshift Survey (2MRS). The sample used includes about 23,200 galaxies with
extinction corrected magnitudes brighter than K_s=11.25 and it allows us to
calculate the flux weighted dipole. The near-infrared flux weighted dipoles are
very robust because they closely approximate a mass weighted dipole, bypassing
the effects of redshift distortions and require no preferred reference frame.
This is combined with the redshift information to determine the change in
dipole with distance. The misalignment angle between the LG and the CMB dipole
drops to 12 degrees at around 50 Mpc/h, but then increases at larger distances,
reaching 21 degrees at around 130 Mpc/h. Exclusion of the galaxies Maffei 1,
Maffei 2, Dwingeloo 1, IC342 and M87 brings the resultant flux dipole to 14
degrees away from the CMB velocity dipole In both cases, the dipole seemingly
converges by 60 Mpc/h. Assuming convergence, the comparison of the 2MRS flux
dipole and the CMB dipole provides a value for the combination of the mass
density and luminosity bias parameters Omega_m^0.6/b_L=0.40+/-0.09.",2005-07-07T11:17:30Z
"Dynamical and photometric imprints of feedback processes on the early
  evolution of E/S0 galaxies","We show that the observed Velocity Dispersion Function of E/S0 galaxies
matches strikingly well the distribution function of virial velocities of
massive halos virializing at z > 1.5, as predicted by the standard hierarchical
clustering scenario in a \LambdaCDM cosmology, for a constant ratio sigma/V_vir
= 0.55 \pm 0.05, close to the value expected at virialization if it typically
occurred at z > 3. This strongly suggests that dissipative processes and later
merging events had little impact on the matter density profile. Adopting the
above sigma/V_vir ratio, the observed relationships between photometric and
dynamical properties which define the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies,
such as the luminosity-sigma (Faber-Jackson) and the luminosity-effective
radius relations, as well as the M_BH-sigma relation, are nicely reproduced.
Their shapes turn out to be determined by the mutual feedback of star-formation
(and supernova explosions)and nuclear activity, along the lines discussed by
Granato et al. (2004). To our knowledge, this is the first semi-analytic model
for which simultaneous fits of the fundamental plane relations and of the
epoch-dependent luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies have been presented.",2005-04-27T14:41:51Z
The mass-metallicity relation for high-redshift damped Ly-alpha galaxies,"We used our database of ESO VLT-UVES spectra of quasars to build up a sample
of 67 Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems with redshifts 1.7<zabs<3.7. For each
system, we measured average metallicities relative to Solar, [X/H] (with either
X=Zn, S or Si), and the velocity widths of low-ionization line profiles, W1. We
find that there is a tight correlation between the two quantities, detected at
the 5sigma significance level. The existence of such a correlation, over more
than two orders of magnitude spread in metallicity, is likely to be the
consequence of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the galaxies
responsible for DLA absorption lines. The best-fit linear relation is
[X/H]=1.35(\pm 0.11)\log W1 -3.69(\pm 0.18)$ with W1 expressed in km/s. While
the slope of this velocity-metallicity relation is the same within
uncertainties between the higher and the lower redshift bins of our sample,
there is a hint of an increase of the intercept point of the relation with
decreasing redshift. This suggests that galaxy halos of a given mass tend to
become more metal-rich with time. Moreover, the slope of this relation is
consistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation for local galaxies.
The DLA systems having the lowest metallicities among the DLA population would
therefore, on average, correspond to the galaxies having the lowest masses. In
turn, these galaxies should have the lowest luminosities among the DLA galaxy
population. This may explain the recent result that the few DLA systems with
detected Ly-alpha emission have higher than average metallicities.",2005-04-18T22:47:04Z
Cosmology with Gamma Ray Bursts,"Apparently, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are all but standard candles. Their
emission is collimated into a cone and the received flux depends on the cone
aperture angle. Fortunately we can derive the aperture angle through an
achromatic steepening of the lightcurve of the afterglow, and thus we can
measure the ""true"" energetics of the prompt emission. Ghirlanda et al. (2004)
found that this collimation-corrected energy correlates tightly with
thefrequency at which most of the radiation of the prompt is emitted. Through
this correlation we can infer the burst energy accurately enough for a
cosmological use. Using the best known 15 GRBs we find very encouraging results
that emphasize the cosmological GRB role. Probing the universe with high
accuracy up to high redshifts, GRBs establish a new insight on the cosmic
expanding acceleration history and accomplish the role of ""missing link""
between the Cosmic Microwave Background and type Ia supernovae, motivating the
most optimistic hopes for what can be obtained from the bursts detected by
SWIFT.",2005-04-13T20:02:11Z
"Multiplicity Amongst Wide Brown Dwarf Companions to Nearby Stars: Gliese
  337CD","We present Lick Natural Guide Star Adaptive Optics observations of the L8
brown dwarf Gliese 337C, which is resolved for the first time into two closely
separated (0""53+/-0""03), nearly equal magnitude components with a K_s flux
ratio of 0.93+/-0.10. Companionship is inferred from the absence of a 3""6
offset source in 2MASS or photographic plate images, implying that the observed
secondary component is a co-moving late-type dwarf. With a projected separation
of 11 AU and nearly equal-magnitude components, Gliese 337CD has properties
similar to other known companion and field substellar binaries. Its long
orbital period (estimated to be ~140-180 yr) inhibits short-term astrometric
mass measurements, but the Gliese 337CD system is ideal for studying the L/T
transition at a fixed age and metallicity. From a compilation of all known
widely separated (>~100 AU) stellar/brown dwarf multiple systems, we find
evidence that the binary fraction of brown dwarfs in these systems is notably
higher than that of field brown dwarfs, 45(+15)(-13)% versus 18(+7)(-4)% for
analogous samples. We speculate on possible reasons for this difference,
including the possibility that dynamic (ejection) interactions which may form
such wide pairs preferentially retain binary secondaries due to their greater
combined mass and/or ability to absorb angular momentum.",2005-03-17T04:18:00Z
"On the relevance of the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to H-alpha
  velocity field.Pattern speeds determination in M100 (NGC 4321)","The relevance of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method is tested to measure the
bar, spiral and inner structure pattern speeds using a gaseous velocity field.
The TW method is applied to various simulated barred galaxies in order to
demonstrate its validity in seven different configurations, including star
formation or/and dark matter halo. The reliability of the different physical
processes involved and of the various observational parameters are also tested.
The simulations show that the TW method could be applied to the gaseous
velocity fields to get a good estimate of the bar pattern speed, under the
condition that regions of shocks are avoided and measurements are confined to
regions where the gaseous bar is well formed. We successfully apply the TW
method to the \ha velocity field of the Virgo Cluster Galaxy M100 (NGC 4321)
and derive pattern speeds of 55+/-5 km/s/kpc for the nuclear structure, 30+/-2
km/s/kpc for the bar and 20+/-1 km/s/kpc for the spiral pattern, in full
agreement with published determinations using the same method or alternative
ones.",2005-05-18T17:26:06Z
Outflows in AGN/Starburst-Composite Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies,"Galactic superwinds occur in almost all infrared-luminous galaxies with star
formation rates (SFRs) above 10 M_sun/yr, as shown by studies of the NaI D
interstellar absorption line. We demonstrate that this result also applies to
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) which host an active galactic nucleus
(AGN) embedded in a strong starburst (SFR > 100 M_sun/yr) by studying a sample
of 26 Seyfert ULIRGs in NaI D. The infrared luminosity of these galaxies is
powered jointly by the AGN and starburst. We find that there are hints of the
influence of the AGN on outflows in Seyfert 2/starburst composites, but the
evidence is not yet statistically conclusive. The evidence we find is lower
wind detection rates (i.e., wind opening angles) in Seyfert 2 ULIRGs than in
galaxies of comparable L_IR, higher velocities than in galaxies of comparable
SFR, and correlations between the neutral gas and the ionized gas in the
extended narrow-line region. Though the AGN probably contributes to the
outflows in Seyfert 2 ULIRGs, its momentum and energy injection is equal to or
less than that of the starburst. Similarly, the outflow mechanical luminosity
(energy outflow rate) per unit radiative luminosity is the same for starburst
and Seyfert 2 ULIRGs. In the nuclei of Seyfert 1s, we observe small-scale
outflows that are powered solely by the AGN. However, in Mrk~231, we observe
both a high-velocity, small-scale and low-velocity, extended outflow. The
latter may be powered by a starburst or radio jet. These large-scale,
lower-velocity outflows certainly exist in other Seyfert 1 ULIRGs, but they are
washed out by the light of the nucleus.",2005-07-01T20:00:05Z
Exploring X-ray emission and absorption in AGN with XMM-Newton EPIC,"Broad band X-ray spectra of high statistical quality obtained with the EPIC
instruments on XMM-Newton are being used to address key issues in AGN Physics,

the effects of reflection and absorption in cold dense matter. A progress
report on these topics is presented by reference to high quality EPIC spectra
of 5 bright Seyfert galaxies covering a wide range in luminosity.",2005-05-20T16:16:55Z
"Prompt and afterglow early X-ray phases in the comoving frame. Evidence
  for Universal properties?","We analyze the Swift XRT light curves and spectra of the gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) for which the redshift has been measured. The sample consists of seven
GRBs. The soft X-ray light curves of all these GRBs are separated into at least
two morphological classes: 1) those starting off with a very steep light curve
decay and 2) those showing a rather mild initial decay. This initial decay is
followed by a flattening and by a further steepening. During these transitions
the soft X-ray spectrum of these GRBs remains constant within the observational
errors (except for one case, GRB050319). For the first time we are able to
exploit the early light curve of GRB afterglows in the comoving frame. Besides
the temporal and spectral behavior we find that the energy of the afterglow
emitted in the (rest frame) time interval 20-200 s and 1300-12600 s after the
trigger correlates with the mean energy of the prompt emission, hinting at a
close link between the two. Averaging over the bursts that have a rather well
sampled light curve and starting immediately after the prompt phase, the energy
emitted in the soft X-rays is about 3% of the energy emitted during the prompt
phase, except for GRB050315, where the soft X-ray emission is as high as 14% of
the prompt emission.",2005-06-20T13:29:19Z
"The MultiSite Spectroscopic Telescope campaign: 2m spectroscopy of the
  V361 Hya variable PG1605+072","We present results and analysis for the 2m spectroscopic part of the
MultiSite Spectroscopic Telescope (MSST) campaign undertaken in May/June 2002.
The goal of the project was to observe the pulsating subdwarf B star PG1605+072
simultaneously in velocity and photometry and to resolve as many of the >50
known modes as possible, which will allow a detailed asteroseismological
analysis. We have obtained over 150 hours of spectroscopy, leading to an
unprecedented noise level of only 207m/s. We report here the detection of 20
frequencies in velocity, with two more likely just below our detection
threshold. In particular, we detect 6 linear combinations, making PG1605+072
only the second star known to show such frequencies in velocity. We investigate
the phases of these combinations and their parent modes and find relationships
between them that cannot be easily understood based on current theory. These
observations, when combined with our simultaneous photometry, should allow
asteroseismology of this most complicated of sdB pulsators.",2005-06-29T14:24:15Z
Directional Statistics for WIMP direct detection II: 2-d read-out,"The direction dependence of the WIMP direct detection rate provides a
powerful tool for distinguishing a WIMP signal from possible backgrounds. We
study the the number of events required to discriminate a WIMP signal from an
isotropic background for a detector with 2-d read-out using non-parametric
circular statistics. We also examine the number of events needed to i) detect a
deviation from rotational symmetry, due to flattening of the Milky Way halo and
ii) detect a deviation in the mean direction due to a tidal stream. If the
senses of the recoils are measured then of order 20-70 events (depending on the
plane of the 2-d read out) will be sufficient to reject isotropy of the raw
recoil angles at 90% confidence. If the senses can not be measured these number
increase by roughly two orders of magnitude (compared with an increase of one
order of magnitude for the case of full 3-d read-out). The distributions of the
reduced angles, with the (time dependent) direction of solar motion subtracted,
are far more anisotropic, however, and if the isotropy tests are applied to
these angles then the numbers of events required are similar to the case of 3-d
read-out. A deviation from rotational symmetry will only be detectable if the
Milky Way halo is significantly flattened. The deviation in the mean direction
due to a tidal stream is potentially detectable, however, depending on the
density and direction of the stream.",2005-08-04T14:26:05Z
Speckle observations of binary stars with a 0.5 m telescope,"We present 36 observations of 17 visual binaries of moderate separation
(range from 0.15'' to 0.79'') made with the 50 cm Cassegrain telescope of the
Jagiellonian University in Cracow. The speckle interferometry technique was
combined with modest optical hardware and a standard photometric CCD camera. We
used broad-band V,R,I filters without a Risley prism to reduce differential
colour refraction, so we performed model analysis to investigate the influence
of this effect on the results of measurements. For binary components of
spectral type O-F, the difference of three spectral classes between them should
bias their relative positions by no more than a couple of tens of
milliarcseconds (mas) for moderate zenith distances. The statistical analysis
of our results confirmed this conclusion. A cross-spectrum approach was applied
to resolve the quadrant ambiguity. Our separations have RMS deviations of
0.012'' and our position angles have RMS deviations of 1.8 deg. Relative
photometry in V, R and I filters appeared to be the less accurately determined
parameter. We discuss our errors in detail and compare them to other speckle
data. This comparison clearly shows the high value of our measurements. We also
present an example of the enhancement of image resolution for an extended
object of angular size greater than the atmospheric coherence patch using
speckle interferometry techniques.",2005-06-08T13:23:35Z
Magnetars origin and progenitors with enhanced rotation,"Among a dozen known magnetar candidates there are no binary objects. As an
estimate of a fraction of binary neutron stars is about 10% it is reasonable to
address the question of solitarity of magnetars, to estimate theoretically the
fraction of binary objects among them, and to mark o probable companions. We
present population synthesis calculations of binary systems. Our goal is to
estimate the number of neutron stars originated from progenitors with enhanced
rotation, as such compact objects can be expected to have large magnetic
fields, ie. they can be magnetars. The fraction of such neutron stars in our
calculations is about 13-16%. Most of these objects are isolated due to
coalescences of components prior to a neutron star formation, or due to a
system disruption after a supernova explosion. The fraction of such neutron
stars in survived binaries is about 1% or lower. Their most numerous companions
are black holes.",2005-05-19T13:33:03Z
"The GRB 030329 host: a blue low metallicity subluminous galaxy with
  intense star formation","We present broad band photometry and spectroscopic observations of the host
galaxy of GRB 030329. Analysis of the spectral emission lines shows that the
host is likely a low metallicity galaxy (Z~0.004). The spectral energy
distribution (SED) constructed with the photometric points has been fitted
using synthetic and observational templates. The best SED fit is obtained with
a starburst template with an age of ~150 Myr and an extinction Av~0.6. We find
that the GRB 030329 host galaxy is a subluminous galaxy (L~0.016 L*) with a
stellar mass of >~10^8 Mo. Three independent diagnostics, based on the
restframe UV continuum, the [OII], and the Balmer emission lines, provide a
consistent unextincted star formation rate of ~0.6 Mo yr^-1, implying a high
unextincted specific star formation rate (~34 Mo yr^-1 (L/L*)^-1). We estimate
that the unextincted specific star formation rate of the GRB 030329 host is
higher than ~93.5% of the galaxies at a similar redshift.",2005-07-20T20:09:56Z
"The Core-Collapse Supernova with ""Non-Uniform"" Magnetic Fields","We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations on the core-collapse of a
massive star with strong magnetic fields and differential rotations using a
numerical code ZEUS-2D. Changing field configurations and laws of differential
rotation parametrically, we compute 14 models and investigate effects of these
parameters on the dynamics. In our models, we do not solve the neutrino
transport and instead employ a phenomenological parametric EOS that takes into
account the neutrino emissions. As a result of the calculations, we find that
the field configuration plays a significant role in the dynamics of the core if
the initial magnetic field is large enough. Models with initially concentrated
fields produce more energetic explosions and more prolate shock waves than the
uniform field. Quadrapole-like fields produce remarkably collimated and fast
jet, which might be important for gamma-ray bursts(GRB). The Lorentz forces
exerted in the region where the plasma-beta is less than unity are responsible
for these dynamics. The pure toroidal field, on the other hand, does not lead
to any explosion or matter ejection. This suggests the presupernova models of
Heger et al.(2003), in which toroidal fields are predominant, is
disadvantageous for the magnetorotation-induced supernova considered here.
Models with initially weak magnetic fields do not lead to explosion or matter
ejection, either. In these models magnetic fields play no role as they do not
grow on the timescale considered in this paper so that the magnetic pressure
could be comparable to the matter pressure. This is because the exponential
field growth as expected in MRI is not seen in our models. The magnetic field
is amplified mainly by field-compression and field-wrapping in our simulations.",2005-05-31T16:46:56Z
"Sun's retrograde motion and violation of even-odd cycle rule in sunspot
  activity","The sum of sunspots number over an odd numbered 11 yr sunspot cycle exceeds
that of its preceding even numbered cycle, and it is well known as Gnevyshev
and Ohl rule (or G--O rule) after the names of the authors who discovered it in
1948. The G--O rule can be used to predict the sum of sunspot numbers of a
forthcoming odd cycle from that of its preceding even cycle. But this is not
always possible because occasionally the G--O rule is violated. So far no
plausible reason is known either for the G--O rule or the violation of this
rule. Here we showed the epochs of the violation of the G--O rule are close to
the epochs of the Sun's retrograde orbital motion about the centre of mass of
the solar system (i.e., the epochs at which the orbital angular momentum of the
Sun is weakly negative). Using this result easy to predict the epochs of
violation of the G--O rule well in advance. We also showed that the solar
equatorial rotation rate determined from sunspot group data during the period
1879--2004 is correlated/anti-correlated to the Sun's orbital torque during
before/after 1945. We have found the existence of a statistically significant
$\sim$ 17 yr periodicity in the solar equatorial rotation rate. The
implications of these findings for understanding the mechanism behind the solar
cycle and the solar-terrestrial relationship are discussed.",2005-07-12T01:50:16Z
Efficient radiative transfer modelling with SKIRT,"We present SKIRT, a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code
developed to study dusty galaxies. We discuss SKIRT's most important
characteristics and present a number of applications. In particular, we focus
on the kinematical aspect of SKIRT. We demonstrate that dust attenuation mimics
the presence of dark matter around elliptical galaxies and that it severely
affects the rotation curves of edge-on galaxies.",2005-03-22T20:53:57Z
"The Hamburg/ESO R-process Enhanced Star survey (HERES) II. Spectroscopic
  analysis of the survey sample","We present the results of analysis of ``snapshot'' spectra of 253 metal-poor
halo stars -3.8 < [Fe/H] < -1.5 obtained in the HERES survey. The spectra are
analysed using an automated line profile analysis method based on the
Spectroscopy Made Easy codes of Valenti & Piskunov. Elemental abundances of
moderate precision have been obtained for 22 elements, C, Mg, Al, Ca, Sc, Ti,
V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, where
detectable. Among the sample of 253 stars, we find 8 r-II stars and 35 r-I
stars. We also find three stars with strong enhancements of Eu which are
s-process rich. A significant number of new very metal-poor stars are
confirmed: 49 stars with [Fe/H] < -3 and 181 stars with -3 < [Fe/H] < -2. We
find one star with [Fe/H] < -3.5. We find the scatter in the abundance ratios
of Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni, with respect to Fe and Mg, to be similar
to the estimated relative errors and thus the cosmic scatter to be small,
perhaps even non-existent. The elements C, Sr, Y, Ba and Eu, and perhaps Zr,
show scatter at [Fe/H] < -2.5 significantly larger than can be explained from
the errors in the analysis, implying scatter which is cosmic in origin.
Significant scatter is observed in abundance ratios between light and heavy
neutron-capture elements at low metallicity and low levels of r-process
enrichment. (*** abridged ***)",2005-05-03T08:48:47Z
The Vimos VLT Deep Survey: Compact structures in the CDFS,"We have used the Vimos VLT Deep Survey in combination with other
spectroscopic, photometric and X-ray surveys from literature to detect several
galaxy structures in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). Both a
friend-of-friend based algorithm applied to the spectroscopic redshift catalog
and an adaptative kernel galaxy density and colour maps correlated with
photometric redshift estimates have been used. We mainly detect a chain-like
structure at z=0.66 and two massive groups at z=0.735 and 1.098 showing signs
of ongoing collapse. We also detect two galaxy walls at z=0.66 and at z=0.735
(extremely compact in redshift space). The first one contains the chain-like
structure and the last one contains in its center one of the two massive
groups. Finally, other galaxy structures that are probably loose low mass
groups are detected. We compare the group galaxy population with simulations in
order to assess the richness of these structures and we study their galaxy
morphological contents. The higher redshift structures appear to probably have
lower velocity dispersion than the nearby ones. The number of moderatly massive
structures we detect is consistent with what is expected for an LCDM model, but
a larger sample is required to put significant cosmological constraints.",2005-07-29T08:08:15Z
"The kinetic temperature of a molecular cloud at redshift 0.7: Ammonia in
  the gravitational lens B0218+357","Using the Effelsberg 100-m telescope, absorption in the (J,K) = (1,1), (2,2)
and (3,3) inversion lines of ammonia (NH_3) was detected at a redshift of z =
0.6847 toward the gravitational lens system B0218+357. The lambda ~ 2cm
absorption peaks at 0.5-1.0 % of the continuum level and appears to cover a
smaller fraction of the radio continuum background than lines at millimeter
wavelengths. Measured intensities are consistent with a rotation temperature of
~35K, corresponding to a kinetic temperature of ~55K. The column density toward
the core of image A then becomes N(NH_3) ~ 1 * 10^(14)cm^(-2) and fractional
abundance and gas density are of order X(NH_3)~10^(-8) and n(H_2)~5 *
10^(3)cm^(-3), respectively. Upper limits are reported for the (2,1) and (4,4)
lines of NH_3 and for transitions of the SO, DCN, OCS, SiO, C_3N, H_2CO, SiC_2,
HC_3N, HC_5N, and CH_3OH molecules. These limits and the kinetic temperature
indicate that the absorption lines are not arising from a cold dark cloud but
from a warm, diffuse, predominantly molecular medium. The physical parameters
of the absorbing molecular complex, seen at a projected distance of ~2 kpc to
the center of the lensing galaxy, are quite peculiar when compared with the
properties of clouds in the Galaxy or in nearby extragalactic systems.",2005-08-09T14:08:43Z
"Identification of X-ray Point Sources and Study on the Nature of 62
  X-ray Globular Cluster Candidates in M31","This paper includes two parts. The first is to present the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of 49 globular cluster (GC) X-ray sources in the BATC 13
intermediate-band filters from 3800 to 10000 A, and identify 8 unidentified
X-ray sources in M31. Using the X-ray data of Einstein observation from 1979 to
1980, ROSAT HRI observation in 1990, Chandra HRC and ACIS-I observations from
1999 to 2001, and the BATC optical survey from 1995 to 1999, we find 49 GC
X-ray sources and 8 new unidentified X-ray sources in the BATC M31 field. By
analyzing SEDs and FWHMs, 4 of the 8 X-ray sources may be GC candidates. The
second is to present some statistical relationships about 62 GC X-ray sources,
of which 58 are already known, and 4 are identified in this paper. The
distribution of M31 GC X-ray sources' V mags is bimodal, with peaks at m_v =
15.65 and m_v = 17.89, which is different from the distribution of GC
candidates. The distribution of B-V color shows that,the GC X-ray sources seem
to be associated preferentially with the redder GCs, in agreement with the
previous results. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that the maximum value of the
absolute difference of B-V distributions of GC X-ray sources and GCs is
D_{max}=0.181, and the probability P=0.068 which means we can reject the
hypothesis that the two distributions are the same at the 90.0% confidence
level. In the end, we study the correlation between X-ray luminosity (0.3-10
keV) and the optical luminosity (in V band) of the GC X-ray sources in M31, and
find that there exits a weak relationship with the linear correlation
coefficient r = 0.36 at the confidence level of 98.0%.",2005-07-20T08:52:57Z
Spectroscopy of the type Ia supernova SN 2002er: days -11 to +215,"We present an extensive set of optical spectroscopy of the nearby type Ia
supernova, SN 2002er, with 24 epochs spanning -11 to +34 days. Its spectral
evolution is fairly typical of a type Ia supernova although it suffers high
extinction. Nevertheless, there are differences in the spectral evolution when
compared to coeval spectra of other normal type Ia supernova with comparable
decline-rate parameters. Modelling of the photospheric phase spectra using a
homogeneous abundance distribution in the atmosphere provides a fair match to
the observations, but only by pushing the adopted distance and risetime close
to the observational limits. Future improvements here will require models with
a more realtistic stratified abundance distribution. From simple modelling of a
nebular spectrum obtained at +215d, we infer a 56Ni mass of 0.69Msun,
consistent with that derived from the light curve.",2005-03-16T10:47:22Z
"Faint Blue Objects in the Hubble Deep Field South Revealed: White
  Dwarfs, Subdwarfs, and Quasars","We explore the nature of the faint blue objects in the Hubble Deep Field
South. We have derived proper motions for the point sources in the Hubble Deep
Field South using a 3 year baseline. Combining our proper motion measurements
with spectral energy distribution fitting enabled us to identify 4 quasars and
42 stars, including 3 white dwarf candidates. Two of these white dwarf
candidates, HDFS 1444 and 895, are found to display significant proper motion,
21.1 $\pm$ 7.9 mas/yr and 34.9 $\pm$ 8.0 mas/yr, and are consistent with being
thick disk or halo white dwarfs located at ~2 kpc. The other faint blue objects
analyzed by Mendez & Minniti do not show any significant proper motion and are
inconsistent with being halo white dwarfs; they do not contribute to the
Galactic dark matter. The observed population of stars and white dwarfs is
consistent with standard Galactic models.",2005-07-22T05:44:27Z
UV properties of early-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster,"We study the UV properties of a volume limited sample of early-type galaxies
in the Virgo cluster combining new GALEX far- (1530 A) and near-ultraviolet
(2310 A) data with spectro-photometric data available at other wavelengths. The
sample includes 264 ellipticals, lenticulars and dwarfs spanning a large range
in luminosity (M(B)<-15). While the NUV to optical or near-IR color magnitude
relations (CMR) are similar to those observed at optical wavelengths, with a
monotonic reddening of the color index with increasing luminosity, the (FUV-V)
and (FUV-H) CMRs show a discontinuity between massive and dwarf objects. An
even more pronounced dichotomy is observed in the (FUV-NUV) CMR. For
ellipticals the (FUV-NUV) color becomes bluer with increasing luminosity and
with increasing reddening of the optical or near-IR color indices. For the
dwarfs the opposite trend is observed. These observational evidences are
consistent with the idea that the UV emission is dominated by hot, evolved
stars in giant systems, while in dwarf ellipticals residual star formation
activity is more common.",2005-07-07T12:21:11Z
"Radiative Effect on Particle Acceleration via Relativistic
  Electromagnetic Expansion","The radiation damping effect on the diamagnetic relativistic pulse
accelerator (DRPA) is studied in two-and-half dimensional Particle-in-Cell
(PIC) simulation with magnetized electron-positron plasmas. Self-consistently
solved radiation damping force converts particle energy to radiation energy.
The DRPA is still robust with radiation, and the Lorentz factor of the most
high energy particles reach more than two thousand before they decouple from
the electromagnetic pulse. Resulted emitted power from the pulse front is lower
in the radiative case than the estimation from the non-radiative case due to
the radiation damping. The emitted radiation is strongly linearly polarized and
peaked within few degrees from the direction of Poynting flux.",2005-04-25T23:09:48Z
"Dynamical evolution of neutrino--cooled accretion disks: detailed
  microphysics, lepton-driven convection, and global energetics","We present a detailed, two dimensional numerical study of the microphysical
conditions and dynamical evolution of accretion disks around black holes when
neutrino emission is the main source of cooling. Such structures are likely to
form after the gravitational collapse of massive rotating stellar cores, or the
coalescence of two compact objects in a binary (e.g., the Hulse--Taylor
system). The physical composition is determined self consistently by
considering two regimes: neutrino--opaque and neutrino--transparent, with a
detailed equation of state which takes into account neutronization, nuclear
statistical equilibrium of a gas of free nucleons and alpha particles,
blackbody radiation and a relativistic Fermi gas of arbitrary degeneracy.
Various neutrino emission processes are considered, with electron/positron
capture onto free nucleons providing the dominant contribution to the cooling
rate. We find that important temporal and spatial scales, related to the
optically thin/optically thick transition are present in the disk, and manifest
themselves clearly in the energy output in neutrinos. This transition produces
an inversion of the lepton gradient in the innermost regions of the flow which
drives convective motions, and affects the density and disk scale height radial
profiles. The electron fraction remains low in the region close to the black
hole, and if preserved in an outflow, could give rise to heavy element
nucleosynthesis. Our specific initial conditions arise from the binary merger
context, and so we explore the implications of our results for the production
of gamma ray bursts.",2005-06-06T18:58:03Z
Near-Infrared water lines in V838 Monocerotis,"V838 Monocerotis had an intriguing, nova-like outburst in January 2002 which
has subsequently led to several studies of the object. It is now recognized
that the outburst of V838 Mon and its evolution are different from that of a
classical nova or other classes of well-known eruptive variables. V838 Mon,
along with two other objects that have analogous properties, appears to
comprise a new class of eruptive variables. There are limited infrared studies
of V838 Mon. Here, we present near-infrared H band (1.5 - 1.75micron) spectra
of V838 Mon from late 2002 to the end of 2004. The principal, new result from
our work is the detection of several, rotation-vibration lines of water in the
H band spectra. The observed water lines have been modeled to first establish
that they are indeed due to water. Subsequently the temperature and column
densities of the absorbing material, from where the water absorption features
originate, are derived. From our analysis, we find that the water features
arise from a cool ~750-900 K region around V838 Mon which appears to be
gradually cooling with time.",2005-06-17T03:41:51Z
On the future of Gamma-Ray Burst Cosmology,"With the understanding that the enigmatic Gamma-Ray Burts (GRBs) are beamed
explosions, and with the recently discovered ``Ghirlanda-relation'', the dream
of using GRBs as cosmological yardsticks may have come a few steps closer to
reality. Assuming the Ghirlanda-relation is real, we have investigated possible
constraints on cosmological parameters using a simulated future sample of a
large number of GRBs inspired by the ongoing SWIFT mission. Comparing with
constraints from a future sample of Type Ia supernovae, we find that GRBs are
not efficient in constraining the amount of dark energy or its equation of
state. The main reason for this is that very few bursts are available at low
redshifts.",2005-04-11T15:40:07Z
Stellar Processes Near the Massive Black Hole in the Galactic Center,"A massive black hole resides in the center of most, perhaps all galaxies. The
one in the center of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, provides a uniquely
accessible laboratory for studying in detail the connections and interactions
between a massive black hole and the stellar system in which it grows; for
investigating the effects of extreme density, velocity and tidal fields on
stars; and for using stars to probe the central dark mass and probe
post-Newtonian gravity in the weak- and strong-field limits. Recent results,
open questions and future prospects are reviewed in the wider context of the
theoretical framework and physical processes that underlie them.

"Radial distribution and strong lensing statistics of satellite galaxies
  and substructure using high resolution LCDM hydrodynamical simulations","We analyse the number density and radial distribution of substructures and
satellite galaxies using cosmological simulations that follow the gas dynamics
of a baryonic component, including shock heating, radiative cooling and star
formation within the hierarchical concordance LCDM model. We find that the
dissipation of the baryons greatly enhances the survival of subhaloes,
expecially in the galaxy core, resulting in a radial distribution of satellite
galaxies that closely follows the overall mass distribution in the inner part
of the halo. Hydrodynamical simulations are necessary to resolve the adiabatic
contraction and dense cores of galaxies, resulting in a total number of
satellites a factor of two larger than found in pure dark matter simulation, in
good agreement with the observed spatial distribution of satellite galaxies
within galaxies and clusters. Convergence tests show that the cored
distribution found by previous authors in pure N-body simulations was due to
physical overmerging of dark matter only structures.
  We proceed to use a ray-shooting technique in order to study the impact of
these additional substructures on the number of violations of the cusp caustic
magnification relation. We develop a new approach to try to disentangle the
effect of substructures from the intrinsic discreteness of N-Body simulations.
Even with the increased number of substructures in the centres of galaxies, we
are not able to reproduce the observed high numbers of discrepancies observed
in the flux ratios of multiply lensed quasars.",2005-06-06T20:03:27Z

Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts Powered by Hot Neutrino-Cooled Coronae,"Cosmological explosions such as core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) are thought to be powered by the rapid conversion of roughly a
solar mass' worth of gravitational binding energy into a comparatively small
amount of outgoing observable kinetic energy. A fractional absorption of the
emitted neutrinos, the particles which carry away the binding energy, by the
expelled matter is a widely discussed mechanism for powering such explosions.
Previous work addressing neutrino emission from core-collapse like environments
assumes that the outgoing neutrino spectrum closely resembles a black body
whose effective temperature is determined by both the rate of energy release
and the surface area of the entire body. Unfortunately, this assumption
minimizes the net efficiency for both neutrino-driven explosion mechanisms.
Motivated by this fact, we qualitatively outline a scenario where a hot corona
deforms the neutrino spectrum away from that of a cool thermal emitter. Our
primary result is that in principle, a coronal-driven explosion mechanism can
enhance the net efficiency of neutrino-driven SNe and GRBs by more than an
order of magnitude.",2005-04-11T22:18:50Z
"Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy of blazars: emission
  lines properties and black hole masses","The ultraviolet (UV) spectra of 16 blazars (<z> ~1) from the archives of the
Hubble Space Telescope Faint Object Spectrograph have been analyzed in order to
study in a systematic way the properties oftheir broad UV emission lines. We
find that the luminosities of the most prominent and intense lines, Ly_alpha
and C IV lambda1549, are similar to those of normal radio-loud quasars at
comparable redshifts. However, the equivalent widths of blazar lines are
significantly smaller than those of radio-loud quasars. Therefore, while the
intrinsic broad line region luminosity of blazars appears to be
indistinguishable from that of radio-loud quasars, their continuum must be
comparatively higher, most probably due to relativistic beaming. We have
combined the UV luminosities of the de-beamed continuum with the emitting gas
velocity to derive estimates of the masses of the central supermassive black
holes. The size of the broad line region was computed in two ways: 1) via an
empirical relationship between UV continuum luminosity and broad line region
size, and 2) through the external photon density required by blazar models to
reproduce the inverse Compton components observed at gamma-rays. The second
method yields significantly different results from the first method, suggesting
that it provides only a very rough estimate or a lower limit on the size of the
broad line region. We find that the average mass of the central black holes in
blazars is ~2.8e8 Msun, with a large dispersion, comparable to those computed
for other radio-loud active galactic nuclei.",2005-06-29T15:14:12Z
"AMICA, an astro-mapper for AMS","The Alpha Magnetic Spectrograph (AMS) is a composite particle detector to be
accommodated on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2008. AMS is mainly
devoted to galactic, charged Cosmic Rays studies, Antimatter and Dark Matter
searches. Besides the main, classical physics goals, capabilities in the field
of GeV and multi-GeV gamma astrophysics have been established and are under
investigation by a number of groups. Due to the unsteadiness of the ISS
platform, a star-mapper device is required in order to fully exploit the
intrinsic arc-min angular resolution provided by the Silicon Tracker. A
star-mapper is conceptually an imaging, optical instrument able to autonomously
recognize a stellar field and to calculate its own orientation with respect to
an inertial reference frame. AMICA (Astro Mapper for Instruments Check of
Attitude) on AMS is responsible for providing real-time information that is
going to be used off-line for compensating the large uncertainties in the ISS
flight attitude and the structural degrees of freedom. In this paper, we
describe in detail the AMICA sub-system and the accommodation/integration
issues and the in-flight alignment procedure adopting identified galactic
(pulsars) and extragalactic (AGNs) sources.",2005-06-16T11:26:20Z

"Near Infrared Survey of Populous Clusters in the LMC: Preliminary
  Results","We report preliminary results from our near-infrared JHK survey of star
clusters in the LMC. The primary goals of the survey are to study the
three-dimensional structure and distance of the LMC. In 2003 and 2004 we used
the Infrared Side Port Imager (ISPI) on the CTIO 4m to obtain near infrared
photometry for a sample of populous LMC clusters. We utilize the K-band
luminosity of core helium burning red clump (RC) stars to obtain individual
cluster distances and present a preliminary assessment of the structure and

"Statistical Analysis of Galaxy Surveys-II. The 3-point galaxy
  correlation function measured from the 2dFGRS","We present new results for the 3-point correlation function, \zeta, measured
as a function of scale, luminosity and colour from the final version of the
two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). The reduced three point
correlation function, Q_3 is estimated for different triangle shapes and sizes,
employing a full covariance analysis. The form of Q_3 is consistent with the
expectations for the \Lambda-cold dark matter model, confirming that the
primary influence shaping the distribution of galaxies is gravitational
instability acting on Gaussian primordial fluctuations. However, we find a
clear offset in amplitude between Q_3 for galaxies and the predictions for the
dark matter. We are able to rule out the scenario in which galaxies are
unbiased tracers of the mass at the 9-sigma level. On weakly non-linear scales,
we can interpret our results in terms of galaxy bias parameters. We find a
linear bias term that is consistent with unity, b_1 = 0.93^{+0.10}_{-0.08} and
a quadratic bias c_2 = b_2 /b_1 = -0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.08}. This is the first
significant detection of a non-zero quadratic bias, indicating a small but
important non-gravitational contribution to the three point function. Our
estimate of the linear bias from the three point function is independent of the
normalisation of underlying density fluctuations, so we can combine this with
the measurement of the power spectrum of 2dFGRS galaxies to constrain the
amplitude of matter fluctuations. We find that the rms linear theory variance
in spheres of radius 8Mpc/h is \sigma_8 = 0.88^{+0.12}_{-0.10}, providing an
independent confirmation of values derived from other techniques. On non-linear
scales, where \xi>1, we find that Q_3 has a strong dependence on scale, colour
and luminosity.",2005-06-12T21:38:42Z
Observations of Mkn 421 in 2004 with H.E.S.S. at large zenith angles,"Mkn 421 was observed during a high flux state for nine nights in April and
May 2004 with the fully operational High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.)
in Namibia. The observations were carried out at zenith angles of
60$^\circ$--65$^\circ$, which result in an average energy threshold of 1.5 TeV
and a collection area reaching 2~km$^2$ at 10~TeV. Roughly 7000 photons from
Mkn~421 were accumulated with an average gamma-ray rate of 8 photons/min. The
overall significance of the detection exceeds 100 standard deviations. The
light-curve of integrated fluxes above 2~TeV shows changes of the diurnal flux
up to a factor of 4.3. For nights of high flux, intra-night variability is
detected with a decay time of less than 1 hour. The time averaged energy
spectrum is curved and is well described by a power-law with a photon index
$\egamm$ and an exponential cutoff at $\ecut$~TeV and an average integral flux
above 2~TeV of 3 Crab flux units. Significant variations of the spectral shape
are detected with a spectral hardening as the flux increases. Contemporaneous
multi-wavelength observations at lower energies (X-rays and gamma-rays above
$\approx 300$~GeV) indicate smaller relative variability amplitudes than seen
above 2~TeV during high flux state observed in April 2004.",2005-06-14T20:00:06Z
The Potential of Multi-Colour Photometry for Pulsating Subdwarf B Stars,"We investigate the potential of multi-colour photometry for partial mode
identification in both long- and short-period variable subdwarf B stars. The
technique presented is based on the fact that the frequency dependence of an
oscillation's amplitude and phase bears the signature of the mode's degree
index l, among other things. Unknown contributing factors can be eliminated
through the evaluation of the amplitude ratios and phase differences arising
from the brightness variation in different wavebands, theoretically enabling
the inference of the degree index from observations in two or more bandpasses.
Employing a designated model atmosphere code, we calculate the brightness
variation expected across the visible disk during a pulsation cycle in terms of
temperature, radius, and surface gravity perturbations to the emergent flux for
representative EC 14026 and PG 1716 star models. Nonadiabatic effects are
considered in detail and found to be significant from nonadiabatic pulsation
calculations applied to our state-of-the-art models of subdwarf B stars.",2005-07-26T14:45:24Z
Which cosmological model with dark energy -- phantom or LambdaCDM,"In cosmology many dramatically different scenarios with the past (big bang
versus bounce) and in the future (de Sitter versus big rip) singularities are
compatible with the present day observations. This difficulty is called the
degeneracy problem. We use the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria of
model selection to overcome this degeneracy and to determine a model with such
a set of parameters which gives the most preferred fit to the SNIa data. We
consider seven representative scenarios, namely: the CDM models with the
cosmological constant, with topological defect, with phantom field, with
bounce, with bouncing phantom field, with brane and model with the linear
dynamical equation of state parameter. Applying the model selection information
criteria we show that AIC indicates the flat phantom model while BIC indicates
both flat phantom and flat $\Lambda$CDM models. Finally we conclude that the
number of essential parameters chosen by dark energy models which are compared
with SNIa data is two.",2005-07-13T14:58:45Z
"Elemental Abundance Ratios in Stars of the Outer Galactic Disk. II.
  Field Red Giants","We summarize a selection process to identify red giants in the direction of
the southern warp of the Galactic disk, employing VI_C photometry and
multi-object spectroscopy. We also present results from follow-up
high-resolution, high-S/N echelle spectroscopy of three field red giants,
finding [Fe/H] values of about -0.5. The field stars, with Galactocentric
distances estimated at 10 to 15 kpc, support the conclusion of Yong, Carney, &
de Almeida (2005) that the Galactic metallicity gradient disappears beyond R_GC
values of 10 to 12 kpc for the older stars and clusters of the outer disk. The
field and cluster stars at such large distances show very similar abundance
patterns, and, in particular, all show enhancements of the ""alpha"" elements O,
Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti and the r-process element Eu. These results suggest that
Type II supernovae have been significant contributors to star formation in the
outer disk relative to Type Ia supernovae within the past few Gyrs. We also
compare our results with those available for much younger objects. The limited
results for the H II regions and B stars in the outer disk also suggest that
the radial metallicity gradient in the outer disk is shallow or absent. The
much more extensive results for Cepheids confirm these trends, and that the
change in slope of the metallicity gradient may occur at a larger
Galactocentric distance than for the older stars and clusters. However, the
younger stars also show rising alpha element enhancements with increasing R_GC,
at least beyond 12 kpc. These trends are consistent with the idea of a
progressive growth in the size of the Galactic disk with time, and episodic
enrichment by Type II supernovae as part of the disk's growth. [Abridged]",2005-06-09T16:23:24Z
"On the He II Emission In Eta Carinae and the Origin of Its Spectroscopic
  Events","We describe and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of
transient emission near 4680 {\AA} in Eta Car, reported earlier by Steiner &
Damineli (2004). If, as seems probable, this is He II $\lambda$4687, then it is
a unique clue to Eta Car's 5.5-year cycle. According to our analysis, several
aspects of this feature support a mass-ejection model of the observed
spectroscopic events, and not an eclipse model. The He II emission appeared in
early 2003, grew to a brief maximum during the 2003.5 spectroscopic event, and
then abruptly disappeared. It did not appear in any other HST spectra before or
after the event. The peak brightness was larger than previously reported, and
is difficult to explain even if one allows for an uncertainty factor of order
3. The stellar wind must provide a temporary larger-than-normal energy supply,
and we describe a special form of radiative amplification that may also be
needed. These characteristics are consistent with a class of mass-ejection or
wind-disturbance scenarios, which have implications for the physical structure
and stability of Eta Car.",2005-04-06T17:49:50Z
"The broad-band X-ray spectrum of the blazar PKS B1830-211 by Chandra and
  INTEGRAL","In this paper we present a broad-band study of the X-ray emission of the
blazar PKS1830-211 based on Chandra and Integral observations. Notwithstanding
the high redshift (z=2.507), it is a bright X-ray source (F(2-10 keV)~10^{-11}
erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}), due to gravitational lensing by an intervening galaxy at
z=0.89. Previous X-ray observations attribute the observed absorption at E<2
keV to the lensing galaxy. Our analysis, although not in contrast with this
hypothesis, suggests also the possibility of an intrinsic (ionized) absorption,
taking place at the front side of the jet. This scenario is also supported by
some evidence, in the same data, of a feature observed at 2.15 keV which can be
interpreted as a blueshifted iron line (v/c ~ 0.18). The SED of PKS1830-211 can
be well modelled by combining a Synchrotron Self-Compton component and an
external source of photons to be scattered up to \gamma-ray energies by
relativistic electrons moving outward in the jet. The main source of low energy
photons is a dust torus at the temperature of 10^3 K as expected in MeV
blazars.",2005-04-06T10:10:28Z
"Abundances of Mn, Co and Eu in a sample of 20 F-G disk stars: the
  influence of hyperfine structure splitting","We present Mn, Co and Eu abundances for a sample of 20 disk F and G dwarfs
and subgiants with metallicities in the range -0.8 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.3. We
investigate the influence of hyperfine structure (HFS) on the derived
abundances of Mn and Co by using HFS data from different sources in the
literature, as well as calculated HFS from interaction factors A and B. Eu
abundances were obtained from spectral synthesis of one Eu II line that takes
into account HFS from a series of recent laboratory measurements. For the lines
analyzed in this study, we find that for manganese, the differences between
abundances obtained with different HFSs are no larger than 0.10 dex. Our cobalt
abundances are even less sensitive to the choice of HFS than Mn, presenting a
0.07 dex maximum difference between determinations with different HFSs.
However, the cobalt HFS data from different sources are significantly
different. Our abundance results for Mn offer an independent confirmation of
the results from Prochaska & McWilliam (2000), who favour type Ia supernovae as
the main nucleosynthesis site of Mn production, in contrast to trends of Mn
versus metallicity previously reported in the literature. For Co, we obtain
[Co/Fe] ~ 0.0 in the range -0.3 < [Fe/H] < +0.3 and [Co/Fe] rising to a level
of +0.2 when [Fe/H] decreases from -0.3 to -0.8, in disagreement with recent
results in the literature. The observed discrepancies may be attributed to the
lack of HFS in the works we used for comparison. Our results for Eu are in
accordance with low-mass type II supernovae being the main site of the

"Radio continuum and far-infrared emission from the galaxies in the
  Eridanus group","The Eridanus galaxies follow the well-known radio-FIR correlation. Majority
(70%) of these galaxies have their star formation rates below that of the Milky
Way. The galaxies having a significant excess of radio emission are identified
as low luminosity AGNs based on their radio morphologies obtained from the GMRT
observations. There are no powerful AGNs (L{20cm} > 10^{23} W Hz^{-1}) in the
group. The two most far-infrared and radio luminous galaxies in the group have
optical and HI morphologies suggestive of recent tidal interactions. The
Eridanus group also has two far-infrared luminous but radio-deficient galaxies.
It is believed that these galaxies are observed within a few Myr of the onset
of an intense star formation episode after being quiescent for at least a 100
Myr. The upper end of the radio luminosity distribution of the Eridanus
galaxies (L_{20cm} ~ 10^{22} W Hz^{-1}) is consistent with that of the field
galaxies, other groups, and late-type galaxies in nearby clusters.",2005-03-24T15:00:21Z
"Fireballs from Quark Stars in the CFL Phase: Application to Gamma Ray
  Bursters","Recent studies of photon-generation mechanisms in the color-superconducting
Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase of dense quark matter have found gamma-ray
emissivities in excess of ~ 10^{50} erg cm^{-3} s^{-1} for temperatures in the
10-30 MeV range. We suggest that this property can trigger gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) and associated fireballs at the surface of hypothetical hot (newly born)
quark stars with an energy release of up to 10^{48}-10^{50} erg within a
fraction of a millisecond. If surrounded by an accretion disk following its
formation, the star's bursting activity can last from tens of milliseconds to
hundreds of seconds releasing up to 10^{52} erg in total energy. We discuss
typical features of observed GRBs within our model and explain how quark stars
in the CFL phase might constitute natural candidates for corresponding inner
engines.",2005-03-16T17:17:08Z
"The First Detailed Abundances for M giants in Baade's Window from
  Infrared Spectroscopy","We report the first abundance analysis of 14 M giant stars in the Galactic
bulge, based on R=25,000 infrared spectroscopy (1.5-1.8um) using NIRSPEC at the
Keck II telescope. Because some of the bulge M giants reach high luminosities
and have very late spectral type, it has been suggested that they are the
progeny of only the most metal rich bulge stars, or possibly members of a
younger bulge population. We find the iron abundance and composition of the M
giants are similar to those of the K giants that have abundances determined
from optical high resolution spectroscopy: <[Fe/H]>=-0.190 +/- 0.020 with a
1-sigma dispersion of 0.08 +/- 0.015. Comparing our bulge M giants to a control
sample of local disk M giants in the Solar vicinity, we find the bulge stars
are enhanced in alpha elements at the level of +0.3 dex relative to the Solar
composition stars, consistent with other studies of bulge globular clusters and
field stars. This small sample shows no dependence of spectral type on
metallicity, nor is there any indication that the M giants are the evolved
members of a subset of the bulge population endowed with special
characteristics such as relative youth or high metallicity. We also find low
12C/13C < 10, confirming the prsence of extra-mixing processes during the red
gaint phase of evolution",2005-06-02T09:37:39Z
Propagation of UHECRs,"In this general introduction to Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) we
discuss the propagation of UHE protons and the GZK feature that is expected
approaching $10^{20}\eV$ for homogeneously distributed sources. We also briefly
present the effects of the propagation on other particles that can play the
role of UHECRs. With the help of numerical simulations for the propgation of
UHECRs, we show that the GZK feature cannot be accurately determined with the
small sample of events with energies $\sim10^{20}\eV$ detected thus far by the
largest two experiments, AGASA and HiRes.",2005-06-17T13:23:22Z
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Relativistic Tori,"Motivated by recent interesting work on p-mode oscillations in axisymmetric
hydrodynamic black-hole tori by Rezzolla, Zanotti, and collaborators, I explore
the robustness of these oscillations by means of two and three-dimensional
relativistic hydrodynamic and MHD simulations. The primary purpose of this
investigation is to determine how the amplitudes of these oscillations are
affected by the presence of known instabilities of black-hole tori, including
the Papaloizou-Pringle instability (PPI) and the magneto-rotational instability
(MRI). Both instabilities drive accretion at rates above those considered in
Rezzolla's work. The increased accretion can allow wave energy to leak out of
the torus into the hole. Furthermore, with the MRI, the presence of turbulence,
which is absent in the hydrodynamic simulations, can lead to turbulent damping
(or excitation) of modes. The current numerical results are preliminary, but
suggest that the PPI and MRI both significantly damp acoustic oscillations in
tori.",2005-03-14T21:55:45Z
Young Neutron Stars and Their Wind Nebulae,"With Teragauss magnetic fields, surface gravity sufficiently strong to
significantly modify light paths, central densities higher than that of a
standard nucleus, and rotation periods of only hundredths of a second, young
neutron stars are sites of some of the most extreme physical conditions known
in the Universe. They generate magnetic winds with particles that are
accelerated to energies in excess of a TeV. These winds form
synchrotron-emitting bubbles as the particle stream is eventually decelerated
to match the general expansion caused by the explosion that formed the neutron
stars. The structure of these pulsar wind nebulae allow us to infer properties
of the winds and the pulsating neutron stars themselves. The surfaces of the
the stars radiate energy from the rapidly cooling interiors where the physical
structure is basically unknown because of our imprecise knowledge of the strong
interaction at ultrahigh densities. Here I present a summary of recent
measurements that allow us to infer the birth properties of neutron stars and
to probe the nature of their winds, the physics of their atmospheres, and the
structure of their interiors.",2005-05-24T21:03:30Z
The Dependence of Galaxy Colors on Luminosity and Environment at z~0.4,"We analyse the B-R_c colors of galaxies as functions of luminosity and local
galaxy density using a large photometric redshift catalog based on the
Red-Sequence Cluster Survey. We select two samples of galaxies with a magnitude
limit of M_Rc<-18.5 and redshift ranges of 0.2<z< 0.4 and 0.4<z<0.6 containing
\~10^5 galaxies each. We model the color distributions of subsamples of
galaxies and derive the red galaxy fraction and peak colors of red and blue
galaxies as functions of galaxy luminosity and environment. The evolution of
these relationships over the redshift range of z~0.5 to z~0.05 is analysed in
combination with published results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find
that there is a strong evolution in the restframe peak color of bright blue
galaxies in that they become redder with decreasing redshift, while the colors
of faint blue galaxies remain approximately constant. This effect supports the
``downsizing'' scenario of star formation in galaxies. While the general
dependence of the galaxy color distributions on the environment is small, we
find that the change of red galaxy fraction with epoch is a function of the
local galaxy density, suggesting that the downsizing effect may operate with
different timescales in regions of different galaxy densities.",2005-07-31T20:34:57Z
"Dating the stellar population in massive early-type galaxies at
  $z\sim$1.5","We present the analysis of 10 massive early-type galaxies at $z\sim1.5$. They
have been identified by means of a near-IR low resolution spectroscopic
follow-up of a complete sample of 36 bright (K' $<$ 18.5) Extremely Red Objects
(EROs, R-K'$>$ 5) selected from the Munich Near-IR ClusterSurvey (MUNICS; Drory
et al. 2001). The low resolution near-IR spectra constrain their redshift at
$1.2<z<1.7$, implying absolute magnitudes M$_{K'}<-26.0$ and stellar masses
well in excess of 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$. Under the hypothesis of pure passive
evolution from $z\sim1.5$ to $z=0$, in the local universe they would have
luminosities L$_K\ge2.5$L$^*$. Thus, they are the high-z counterparts of the
local old massive (10$^{11}-10^{12}$ M$_\odot$) early-type galaxies populating
the bright end of the local luminosity function of galaxies. The comparison of
their spectro-photometric properties with a grid of synthetic models suggests
that the stellar populations in more than half of the sample are about
$\sim$3-5 Gyr old and 1-2 Gyr old in the remaining part. These ages imply
formation redshift $z_{f} > 2$ for all the galaxies and $z_{f} \geq 4$ for the
oldest ones. The comparison of the 4000\AA break and of the overall spectral
shape of the average spectrum of the 10 galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ with those of
their local counterpartsconfirms that field massive early-type galaxies formed
the bulk of their stellar mass at $2<z<4$, most likely over a short ($<$ 1 Gyr)
star formation time scale, consistently with the results derived from the
analysis of their individual spectro-photometric properties.",2005-05-23T06:56:56Z
"The Surprising Anisotropy of Fast Rotating, Disky Elliptical Galaxies","The projected kinematical properties of unequal-mass merger remnants of disk
galaxies are analysed and shown to agree well with observations of disky, fast
rotating elliptical galaxies. This supports the major merger hypothesis of
early-type galaxy formation. However, in contrast to previous claims, the
merger remnants are very anisotropic with values of the anisotropy parameter
that are similar to equal-mass merger remnants that form boxy, slowly rotating
ellipticals. Including gas in the simulations does not change this result
although the line-of-sight velocity profile and the intrinsic orbital structure
are strongly affected by the presenceof gas. The kinematical difference between
boxy and disky ellipticals appears not to be the amount of anisotropy but
rather rotation and the shape of the velocity dispersion tensor. The apparent
isotropy of observed disky ellipticals is shown to result from inclination
effects. Even small inclination angles strongly reduce the measured anisotropy
of fast rotating systems, seen in projection. A second problem is the limited
amount of information that is available when measuring only the central
velocity dispersion and a characteristic rotation and ellipticity. Methods are
investigated that allow a better determination of the intrinsic anisotropy of
fast rotating early-type galaxies with known inclination angles.",2005-04-27T11:09:51Z
Metals in Star-Forming Galaxies at High Redshift,"The chemical composition of high-redshift galaxies is an important property
that gives clues to their past history and future evolution. Measuring
abundances in distant galaxies with current techniques is often a challenge,
and the canonical metallicity indicators can often not be applied. I discuss
currently available metallicity indicators based on stellar and interstellar
absorption and emission lines, and assess their limitations and systematic
uncertainties. Recent studies suggest that star-forming galaxies at redshift
around 3 have heavy-element abundances already close to solar, in agreement
with predictions from cosmological models.",2005-06-13T18:28:12Z
"An Active Instance-based Machine Learning method for Stellar Population
  Studies","We have developed a method for fast and accurate stellar population
parameters determination in order to apply it to high resolution galaxy
spectra. The method is based on an optimization technique that combines active
learning with an instance-based machine learning algorithm. We tested the
method with the retrieval of the star-formation history and dust content in
""synthetic"" galaxies with a wide range of S/N ratios. The ""synthetic"" galaxies
where constructed using two different grids of high resolution theoretical
population synthesis models. The results of our controlled experiment shows
that our method can estimate with good speed and accuracy the parameters of the
stellar populations that make up the galaxy even for very low S/N input. For a
spectrum with S/N=5 the typical average deviation between the input and fitted
spectrum is less than 10**{-5}. Additional improvements are achieved using
prior knowledge.",2005-07-22T01:05:49Z
"The Diffuse Emission and a Variable ULX in the Elliptical Galaxy NGC
  3379","A Chandra observation of the intermediate luminosity (M_B=-20) elliptical
galaxy NGC 3379 resolves 75% of the X-ray emission within the central 5kpc into
point sources. Spectral analysis of the remaining unresolved emission within
the central 770pc indicates that 90% of the emission probably arises from
undetected point sources, while 10% arises from thermal emission from kT=0.6keV
gas. Assuming a uniform density distribution in the central region of the
galaxy gives a gas mass of 5.0e5 Mo.Such a small amount of gas can be supplied
by stellar mass loss in only 1.0e7 years. Thus, the gas must be accreting into
the central supermassive black hole at a very low radiative efficiency as in
the ADAF or RIAF models, or is being expelled in a galactic wind driven by the
same AGN feedback mechanism as that observed in cluster cooling flows. If the
gas is being expelled in an AGN driven wind, then the ratio of mechanical to
radio power of the AGN must be 1.0e4, which is comparable to that measured in
cluster cooling flows which have recently been perturbed by radio outbursts.
The brightest point source in NGC 3379 is located 360pc from the central AGN
with a peak luminosity of 3.5e39 ergs/s, which places it in the class of
ultra-luminous X-ray point sources (ULX). Analysis of an archival ROSAT HRI
observation of NGC 3379 shows that this source was at a comparable luminosity 5
years prior to the Chandra observation. During the Chandra observation, the
source intensity smoothly varies by a factor of two with the suggestion of an
8-10 hour period.",2005-06-01T13:07:05Z
Non-linear Structure Formation in Cosmologies with Early Dark Energy,"We argue that a few per cent of ""Early Dark Energy"" can be detected by the
statistics of nonlinear structures. The presence of Dark Energy during linear
structure formation is natural in models where the present tiny Dark-Energy
density is related to the age of the Universe rather than a new fundamental
small parameter. Generalisation of the spherical collapse model shows that the
linear collapse parameter delta_c is lowered. The corresponding relative
enhancement of weak gravitational lensing on arc-minute scales lowers the value
of sigma_8 inferred from a given lensing amplitude as compared to Lambda-CDM.
In presence of Early Dark Energy, structures grow slower, such that for given
sigma_8 the number of galaxies and galaxy clusters is substantially increased
at moderate and high redshift. For realistic models, the number of clusters
detectable through their thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect at redshift unity
and above, e.g. with the Planck satellite, can be an order of magnitude larger
than for Lambda-CDM.",2005-07-11T15:03:23Z
On the Size Distribution of Close-In Extrasolar Giant Planets,"The precisions of extrasolar planet radius measurements are reaching the
point at which meaningful and discriminatory comparisons with theoretical
predictions are can be made. However, care must be taken to account for
selection effects in the transit surveys that detect the transiting planets for
which radius measurements are possible. Here I identify one such selection
effect, such that the number of planets with radius R_p detected in a
signal-to-noise ratio limited transit survey is proportional to R_p^alpha, with
alpha~4-6. In the presence of a dispersion sigma in the intrinsic distribution
of planet radii, this selection effect translates to bias b in the radii of
observed planets. Detected planets are, on average, larger by a fractional
amount b ~ alpha (sigma/<R_p>)^2 relative to the mean radius <R_p> of the
underlying distribution. I argue that the intrinsic dispersion in planetary
radii is likely to be in the range sigma = (0.05-0.13)R_J, where the lower
bound is that expected theoretically solely from the variance in stellar
insolation, and the upper bound is the 95% c.l. upper limit from the scatter in
observed radii. Assuming an arbitrary but plausible value of sigma/<R_p>~10%,
and thus b~6%, I infer a mean intrinsic radius of close-in massive extrasolar
planets of <R_p>=(1.03+/-0.01)R_J. This value reinforces the case for HD209458b
having an anomalously large radius, and may be inconsistent with coreless
models of irradiated giant planets.",2005-04-05T20:00:03Z
"HS0139+0559, HS0229+8016, HS0506+7725 and HS0642+5049: Four new
  long-period cataclysmic variables","We present time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry of four
relatively bright (V~14.0-15.5) long-period cataclysmic variables (CVs)
discovered in the Hamburg Quasar Survey: HS0139+0559, HS0229+8016, HS0506+7725
and HS0642+5049. Their respective orbital periods, 243.69+-0.49min,
232.550+-0.049min, 212.7+-0.2min and 225.90+-0.23min are determined from radial
velocity and photometric variability studies. HS0506+7725 is characterised by
strong Balmer and He emission lines, short-period (~10-20min) flickering and
weak X-ray emission in the ROSAT All Sky Survey. The detection of a deep low
state (~18.5) identifies HS0506+7725 as a member of the VY Scl stars.
HS0139+0559, HS0229+8016 and HS0642+5049 display thick-disc like spectra and no
or only weak flickering activity. HS0139+0559 and HS0229+8016 exhibit clean
quasi-sinusoidal radial velocity varations of their emission lines but no or
very little orbital photometric variability. In contrast, we detect no radial
velocity variation in HS0642+5049 but a noticeable orbital brightness
variation. We identify all three systems either as UX UMa-type novalike
variables or as Z Cam-type dwarf novae. Our identification of these four new
systems underlines that the currently known sample of CVs is rather incomplete
even for bright objects. The four new systems add to the clustering of orbital
periods in the 3-4h range found in the sample of HQS selected CVs, and we
discuss the large incidence of magnetic CVs and VY Scl/SW Sex stars found in
this period range among the known population of CVs.",2005-07-14T09:46:00Z
"Statistical characteristics of observed Ly-$α$ forest and the shape
  of linear power spectrum","Properties of $\sim$ 6 000 Ly-$\alpha$ absorbers observed in 19 high
resolution spectra of QSOs are investigated using the model of formation and
evolution of DM structure elements based on the Zel'dovich theory. This model
asserts that absorbers are formed in the course of both linear and nonlinear
adiabatic or shock compression of dark matter (DM) and gaseous matter. It
allows us to link the column density and overdensity of DM and gaseous
components with the observed column density of neutral hydrogen, redshifts and
Doppler parameters of absorbers and demonstrates that at high redshifts we
observe a self similar period of structure evolution with the Gaussian initial
perturbations. We show that the colder absorbers are associated with rapidly
expanded regions of a galactic scale which represent large amplitude negative
density perturbations.
  We extend and improve the method of measuring the power spectrum of initial
perturbations proposed in Demia\'nski & Doroshkevich (2003b). Our method links
the observed separations and the DM column density of absorbers with the
correlation function of the initial velocity field. We recover the cold dark
matter (CDM) like power spectrum at scales 10> D > 0.15Mpc/h with a precision
of ~15%. However at scales $\sim 3 - 150 h^{-1}$kpc the measured and CDM--like
spectra are different. This result suggests a possible complex inflation with
generation of excess power at small scales.",2005-06-02T14:17:52Z
"Interstellar 12C/13C ratios through CH+ ll 3957,4232 absorption in local
  clouds: incomplete mixing in the ISM","The 12C/13C isotope ratio is a tracer of stellar yields and the efficiency of
mixing in the ISM. 12CH+/13CH+ is not affected by interstellar chemistry, and
is the most secure way of measuring 12C/13C in the diffuse ISM. R= 12C/13C is
90 in the solar system. Previous measurements of 12CH+ ll3957.7,4232.3 and
13CH+ ll3958.2,4232.0 absorption toward nearby stars indicate some variations
in 12C/13C, with values ranging from 40 to 90 suggesting inefficient mixing.
Except for the cloud toward zeta Oph, these R values are strongly affected by
noise. With UVES on the VLT we have improved on the previous interstellar
12C/13C measurements. The weighted 12C/13C ratio in the local ISM is 78.27 +-
1.83, while the weighted dispersion of our measurements is 12.7, giving a 6.9
sigma scatter. Thus we report on a 6.9 sigma detection of 16.2%
root-mean-square variations in the carbon isotopic ratio on scales of ~100 pc:
R= 74.7 +- 2.3 in the zetaOph cloud, while R = 88.6 +- 3.0 toward HD152235 in
the Lupus clouds, R = 62.2 +- 5.3 towards HD110432 in the Coalsack, and R =
98.9 +- 10.1 toward HD170740. The observed variations in 13C/12C are the first
significant detection of chemical heterogeneity in the local ISM.",2005-06-03T16:34:07Z
"Using transport coefficients of cosmic rays in turbulent magnetic fields
  to determine hybrid viscosity in hot accretion disks around AGN","The nature of the viscosity operative in hot, two-temperature accretion disks
around AGN has been a long-standing, unsolved problem. It has been previously
suggested that protons, in conjunction with the turbulent magnetic field that
is likely to exist in the accretion disk, might be crucial in providing this
viscosity. Several authors have recently determined diffusion coefficients for
charged particles (cosmic rays) propagating in turbulent magnetic fields by
means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We use the diffusion coefficients
for protons determined by these simulations to find the effective mean free
path for protons in hot accretion disks. This in turn yields good estimates of
the viscosity due to energetic protons embedded in the turbulent magnetic field
of a hot, two-temperature accretion disk. We combine this with a simple
two-temperature accretion disk model to determine the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$
viscosity parameter arising out of this mechanism. We find that protons
diffusing in the turbulent magentic field embedded in a hot accretion d isk
provide a physically reasonable source of viscosity in hot accretion disks
around AGN.",2005-07-10T06:57:30Z
"Lorentz-violation and cosmological perturbations: a toy brane-world
  model","We study possible effects of Lorentz-violation on the generation of
cosmological perturbations at inflation by introducing a simple inflating
five-dimensional brane-world setup with violation of four-dimensional
Lorentz-invariance at an energy scale $k$. We consider massless scalar field,
meant to mimic perturbations of inflaton and/or gravitational field, in this
background. At three-momenta below $k$, there exists a zero mode localized on
the brane, whose behaviour coincides with that in four-dimensional theory. On
the contrary, at three-momenta above $k$, the localized mode is absent and
physics is entirely five-dimensional. As three-momenta get redshifted, more
modes get localized on the brane, the phenomenon analogous to ``mode
generation''. We find that for $k\gg H$, where $H$ is the inflationary Hubble
scale, the spectrum of perturbations coincides with that in four-dimensional
theory. For $k < H$ and time-dependent bulk parameters, the spectrum deviates,
possibly strongly, from the flat spectrum even for pure de Sitter inflation.",2005-04-11T17:55:29Z
"The Sgr B2 X-ray Echo of the Galactic Center Supernova Explosion that
  Produced Sgr A East","The possible impact Sgr A East is having on the Galactic center has fueled
speculation concerning its age and the energetics of the supernova explosion
that produced it. We have carried out the first in-depth analysis of the
remnant's evolution and its various interactions: with the stellar winds
flowing out from the inner ~2 pc, with the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, and
with the 50 km/s molecular cloud behind and to the East of the nucleus. We have
found that a rather ""standard"" supernova explosion with energy ~1.5e51 ergs is
sufficient to create the remnant we see today, and that the latter is probably
only ~1,700 years old. The X-ray Ridge between ~9"" and 15"" to the NE of Sgr A*
appears to be the product of the current interaction between the remaining
supernova ejecta and the outflowing winds. Perhaps surprisingly, we have also
found that the passage of the remnant across the black hole would have enhanced
the accretion rate onto the central object by less than a factor 2. Such a
small increase cannot explain the current Fe fluorescence observed from the
molecular cloud Sgr B2; this fluorescence would have required an increase in
Sgr A*'s luminosity by 6 orders of magnitude several hundred years ago.
Instead, we have uncovered what appears to be a more plausible scenario for
this transient irradiation--the interaction between the expanding remnant and
the 50 km/s molecular cloud. The first impact would have occurred about 1,200
years after the explosion, producing a 2-200 keV luminosity of ~1e39 ergs/s.
During the intervening 300-400 years, the dissipation of kinetic energy
subsided considerably, leading to the much lower luminosity (~1e36 ergs/s at
2-10 keV) we see today.",2005-06-10T18:22:49Z
Signatures of Planets in Spatially Unresolved Disks,"Main sequence stars are commonly surrounded by debris disks, composed of cold
dust continuously replenished by a reservoir of undetected dust-producing
planetesimals. In a planetary system with a belt of planetesimals (like the
Solar System's Kuiper Belt) and one or more interior giant planets, the
trapping of dust particles in the mean motion resonances with the planets can
create structure in the dust disk, as the particles accumulate at certain
semimajor axes. Sufficiently massive planets may also scatter and eject dust
particles out of a planetary system, creating a dust depleted region inside the
orbit of the planet. In anticipation of future observations of spatially
unresolved debris disks with the Spitzer Space Telescope, we are interested in
studying how the structure carved by planets affects the shape of the disk's
spectral energy distribution (SED), and consequently if the SED can be used to
infer the presence of planets. We numerically calculate the equilibrium spatial
density distributions and SEDs of dust disks originated by a belt of
planetesimals in the presence of interior giant planets in different planetary
configurations, and for a representative sample of chemical compositions. The
dynamical models are necessary to estimate the enhancement of particles near
the mean motion resonances with the planets, and to determine how many
particles drift inside the planet's orbit. Based on the SEDs and predicted
$\it{Spitzer}$ colors we discuss what types of planetary systems can be
distinguishable from one another and the main parameter degeneracies in the
model SEDs.",2005-06-27T20:32:22Z
System Parameters of the Transiting Extrasolar Planet HD 209458b,"We derive improved system parameters for the HD 209458 system using a model
that simultaneously fits both photometric transit and radial velocity
observations. The photometry consists of previous Hubble Space Telescope STIS
and FGS observations, twelve I-band transits observed between 2001-2003 with
the Mt. Laguna Observatory 1m telescope, and six Stromgren b+y transits
observed between 2001-2004 with two of the Automatic Photometric Telescopes at
Fairborn Observatory. The radial velocities were derived from Keck/HIRES
observations. The model properly treats the orbital dynamics of the system, and
thus yields robust and physically self-consistent solutions. Our set of system
parameters agrees with previously published results though with improved
accuracy. For example, applying robust limits on the stellar mass of
0.93-1.20Msun, we find 1.26 < Rplanet < 1.42 Rjup and 0.59 < Mplanet < 0.70
Mjup. We can reduce the uncertainty on these estimates by including a stellar
mass-radius relation constraint, yielding Rplanet = 1.35 +/- 0.07 Rjup and
Mplanet = 0.66 +/- 0.04 Mjup. Our results verify that the planetary radius is
10-20% larger than predicted by planet evolution models, confirming the need
for an additional mechanism to slow the evolutionary contraction of the planet.
A revised ephemeris is derived, T0=2452854.82545 + 3.52474554E (HJD), which now
contains an uncertainty in the period of 0.016s and should facilitate future
searches for planetary satellites and other bodies in the HD 209458 system.",2005-04-26T18:55:18Z
"Parameters of the prompt gamma-ray burst emission estimated with the
  opening angle of jets","We present in this paper an approach to estimate the initial Lorentz factor
of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) without referring to the delayed emission of the
early afterglow. Under the assumption that the afterglow of the bursts
concerned occurs well before the prompt emission dies away, the Lorentz factor
measured at the time when the duration of the prompt emission is ended could be
estimated by applying the well-known relations of GRB jets. With the concept of
the efficiency for converting the explosion energy to radiation, this Lorentz
factor can be related to the initial Lorentz factor of the source. The
corresponding rest frame peak energy can accordingly be calculated. Applying
this method, we estimate the initial Lorentz factor of the bulk motion and the
corresponding rest frame spectral peak energy of GRBs for a new sample where
the redshift and the break time in the afterglow are known. Our analysis shows
that, in the circumstances, the initial Lorentz factor of the sample would peak
at 200 and would be distributed mainly within $(100,400)$, and the peak of the
distribution of the corresponding rest frame peak energy would be $0.8keV$ and
its main region would be $(0.3keV,3keV)$.",2005-04-04T14:38:09Z
"Full computation of massive AGB evolution. II. The role of mass loss and
  cross-sections","In the course of a systematic exploration of the uncertainties associated to
the input micro- and macro-physics in the modeling of the evolution of
intermediate mass stars during their Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, we
focus on the role of the nuclear reactions rates and mass loss. We consider
masses 3<M/Msun<6.5 for a metallicity typical for Globular Cluster, Z=0.001,
and compare the results obtained by computing the full nucleosynthesis with hot
bottom burning (HBB), for a network of 30 elements, using either the NACRE or
the Cameron & Fowler (1988) cross-sections. The results differ in particular
with respect to the Na23 nucleosynthesis (which is more efficient in the NACRE
case) and the magnesium isotopes ratios. For both choices, however, the CNO
nucleosynthesis shows that the C+N+O is constant within a factor of two, in our
models employing a very efficient convection treatment. Different mass loss
rates alter the physical conditions for HBB and the length of the AGB phase,
changing indirectly the chemical yields. These computations show that the
predictive power of our AGB models is undermined by these uncertainties. In
particular, it appears at the moment very difficult to strongly accept or
dismiss that these sources play a key-role in the pollution of Globular
Clusters (GCs)",2005-05-11T07:08:35Z
Measurement of Spin-Orbit Alignment in an Extrasolar Planetary System,"We determine the stellar, planetary, and orbital properties of the transiting
planetary system HD 209458, through a joint analysis of high-precision radial
velocities, photometry, and timing of the secondary eclipse. Of primary
interest is the strong detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, the
alteration of photospheric line profiles that occurs because the planet occults
part of the rotating surface of the star. We develop a new technique for
modeling this effect, and use it to determine the inclination of the planetary
orbit relative to the apparent stellar equator [lambda = (-4.4 +/- 1.4)
degrees], and the line-of-sight rotation speed of the star [v*sin(I) = (4.70
+/- 0.16) km/s]. The uncertainty in these quantities has been reduced by an
order of magnitude relative to the pioneering measurements by Queloz and
collaborators. The small but nonzero misalignment is probably a relic of the
planet formation epoch, because the expected timescale for tidal
coplanarization is larger than the age of the star. Our determination of
v*sin(I) is a rare case in which rotational line broadening has been isolated
from other broadening mechanisms.",2005-04-25T19:05:25Z
"Spectral Formation in X-Ray Pulsars: Bulk Comptonization in the
  Accretion Shock","Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars are among the most luminous X-ray sources in
the Galaxy. However, despite decades of theoretical and observational work
since their discovery, no satisfactory model for the formation of the observed
X-ray spectra has emerged. In particular, the previously available theories are
unable to reproduce the power-law variation observed at high energies in many
sources. In this paper, we present the first self-consistent calculation of the
spectrum emerging from a pulsar accretion column that includes an explicit
treatment of the energization occurring in the shock. Using a rigorous
eigenfunction expansion method based on the exact dynamical solution for the
velocity profile in the column, we obtain a closed-form expression for the
Green's function describing the upscattering of radiation injected into the
column from a monochromatic source located at the top of the thermal mound,
near the base of the flow. The Green's function is convolved with a Planck
distribution to calculate the radiation spectrum resulting from the
reprocessing of blackbody photons emitted by the thermal mound. We demonstrate
that the energization of the photons in the shock naturally produces an X-ray
spectrum with a power-law shape at high energies and a blackbody shape at low
energies, in agreement with many observations of accreting X-ray pulsars.",2005-05-06T15:47:17Z
"Discovery of the Binary Pulsar PSR B1259-63 in Very-High-Energy Gamma
  Rays around Periastron with H.E.S.S","We report the discovery of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission of the
binary system PSR B1259-63/SS 2883 of a radio pulsar orbiting a massive,
luminous Be star in a highly eccentric orbit. The observations around the 2004
periastron passage of the pulsar were performed with the four 13 m Cherenkov
telescopes of the H.E.S.S. experiment, recently installed in Namibia and in
full operation since December 2003. Between February and June 2004, a gamma-ray
signal from the binary system was detected with a total significance above 13
sigma. The flux was found to vary significantly on timescales of days which
makes PSR B1259-63 the first variable galactic source of VHE gamma-rays
observed so far. Strong emission signals were observed in pre- and
post-periastron phases with a flux minimum around periastron, followed by a
gradual flux decrease in the months after. The measured time-averaged energy
spectrum above a mean threshold energy of 380 GeV can be fitted by a simple
power law F_0(E/1 TeV)^-Gamma with a photon index Gamma =
2.7+-0.2_stat+-0.2_sys and flux normalisation F_0 = (1.3+-0.1_stat+-0.3_sys)
10^-12 TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1. This detection of VHE gamma-rays provides unambiguous
evidence for particle acceleration to multi-TeV energies in the binary system.
In combination with coeval observations of the X-ray synchrotron emission by
the RXTE and INTEGRAL instruments, and assuming the VHE gamma-ray emission to
be produced by the inverse Compton mechanism, the magnetic field strength can
be directly estimated to be of the order of 1 G.",2005-06-13T19:04:00Z
"Low-Energy Hadron Production Data and Current Status of CERN
  Measurements","Data on low-energy hadron production in collisions of nucleons, pions and
kaons with light nuclei are needed for many astrophysical and accelerator
applications. Modern simulations have reached a level of accuracy that the lack
of detailed understanding of hadron production processes has become one of the
most important limitations to further improvements. After giving some examples
of hadroproduction processes in astrophysics and neutrino experiments we
briefly review existing fixed-target data on light nuclei. Preliminary results
and prospects of current CERN measurements (HARP, NA49) are discussed.",2005-04-15T18:07:41Z
Spectroscopic metallicities for planet-host stars: extending the samples,"We present stellar parameters and metallicities for 29 planet-host stars, as
well as for a large volume-limited sample of 53 stars not known to be orbited
by any planetary-mass companion. These stars add to the results presented in
our previous series of papers, providing two large and uniform samples of 119
planet-hosts and 94 ``single'' stars with accurate stellar parameters and
[Fe/H] estimates. The analysis of the results further confirms that stars with
planets are metal-rich when compared with average field dwarfs. Important
biases that may compromise future studies are also discussed. Finally, we
compare the metallicity distributions for single planet-hosts and planet-hosts
in multiple stellar systems. The results show that a small difference cannot be
excluded, in the sense that the latter sample is slighly overmetallic. However,
more data are needed to confirm this correlation.",2005-04-06T18:21:04Z
Oscillations of Thick Accretion Discs Around Black Holes - II,"We present a numerical study of the global modes of oscillation of thick
accretion discs around black holes. We have previously studied the case of
constant distributions of specific angular momentum. In this second paper, we
investigate (i) how the size of the disc affects the oscillation
eigenfrequencies, and (ii) the effect of power-law distributions of angular
momentum on the oscillations. In particular, we compare the oscillations of the
disc with the epicyclic eigenfrequencies of a test particle with different
angular momentum distributions orbiting around the central object. We find that
there is a frequency shift away from the epicyclic eigenfrequency of the test
particle to lower values as the size of the tori is increased. We have also
studied the response of a thick accretion disc to a localized external
perturbation using non constant specific angular momentum distributions within
the disc. We find that in this case it is also possible (as reported previously
for constant angular momentum distributions) to efficiently excite internal
modes of oscillation. In fact we show here that the local perturbations excite
global oscillations (acoustic p modes) closely related to the epicyclic
oscillations of test particles. Our results are particularly relevant in the
context of low mass X-ray binaries and microquasars, and the high frequency
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) observed in them. Our computations make use
of a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code in azimuthal symmetry, and use a
gravitational potential that mimics the effects of strong gravity.",2005-05-21T21:11:01Z
Heavy element abundances in DAO white dwarfs measured from FUSE data,"We present heavy element abundance measurements for 16 DAO white dwarfs,
determined from Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer {FUSE} spectra. Evidence
of absorption by heavy elements was found in the spectra of all the objects.
Measurements were made using models that adopted the temperatures, gravities
and helium abundances determined from both optical and FUSE data by Good et al.
(2004). Despite the different evolutionary paths that the types of DAO white
dwarfs are thought to evolve through, their abundances were not found to vary
significantly, apart from for the silicon abundances. Abundances measured when
the FUSE derived values of temperature, gravity and helium abundance were
adopted were, in general, a factor 1-10 higher than those determined when the
optical measure of those parameters was used. Satisfactory fits to the
absorption lines were achieved in approximately equal number. The models that
used the FUSE determined parameters seemed better at reproducing the strength
of the nitrogen and iron lines, while for oxygen, the optical parameters were
better.",2005-07-14T18:27:52Z
Model Simulations of a Shock-Cloud Interaction in the Cygnus Loop,"We present optical observations and 2D hydrodynamic modeling of an isolated
shocked ISM cloud. H$\alpha$ images taken in 1992.6 and 2003.7 of a small
optical emission cloud along the southwestern limb of the Cygnus Loop were used
to measure positional displacements of $\sim$ $0 \farcs 1$ yr$^{-1}$ for
surrounding Balmer dominated emission filaments and $0\farcs025 - \farcs055$
yr$^{-1}$ for internal cloud emission features. These measurements imply
transverse velocities of $\simeq$ 250 km s$^{-1}$ and $\simeq$ 80 -- 140 km
s$^{-1}$ for ambient ISM and internal cloud shocks respectively. The complex
shock structure visible within the cloud indicates that the cloud's internal
density distribution is two phased: a smoothly varying background density which
is populated by higher density clumps. We present model results for a shock
interacting with a non-uniform ISM cloud. We find that this cloud can be well
modeled by a smoothly varying power law core surrounded by a low density
envelope with a Lorentzian profile. The lack of sharp density gradients in such
a model inhibits the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, consistent with
the cloud's appearance. Our model results also suggest that cloud clumps have
densities $\sim$ 10 times the ambient ISM density and account for $\sim$ 30% of
the total cloud volume. Moreover, the observed spacing of internal cloud shocks
and model simulations indicate that the distance between clumps is $\sim$ 4
clump radii.",2005-07-13T17:44:04Z

"Rotational velocities of the giants in symbiotic stars: I. D'-type
  symbiotics","We have measured the rotational velocities (v.sini) of the mass donors in a
number of D'--type symbiotic stars, using the cross-correlation function
method. Four from five D' symbiotic stars with known v.sini, appeared to be
very fast rotators compared with the catalogues of v.sini for the corresponding
spectral types. At least three of these stars rotate at a substantial fraction
(>=0.5) of the critical velocity. This means that at least in D'-type
symbiotics the cool components rotate faster than isolated giants. If these
binary stars are synchronized, their orbital periods should be relatively short
(4-60 days). We also briefly discuss the possible origin of the rapid rotation
and its connection with mass loss and dust formation.",2005-07-25T08:44:02Z
"Gravitational waves, inflation and the cosmic microwave background:
  towards testing the slow-roll paradigm","One of the fundamental and yet untested predictions of inflationary models is
the generation of a very weak cosmic background of gravitational radiation. We
investigate the sensitivity required for a space-based gravitational wave laser
interferometer with peak sensitivity at $\sim 1$ Hz to observe such signal as a
function of the model parameters and compare it with indirect limits that can
be set with data from present and future cosmic microwave background missions.
We concentrate on signals predicted by slow-roll single field inflationary
models and instrumental configurations such as those proposed for the LISA
follow-on mission: Big Bang Observer.",2005-04-13T10:44:53Z
The temperature structure in the core of Sersic 159-03,"We present results from a new 120 ks XMM-Newton observation of the cluster of
galaxies Sersic 159-03. In this paper we focus on the high-resolution X-ray
spectra obtained with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS). The spectra
allow us to constrain the temperature structure in the core of the cluster and
determine the emission measure distribution as a function of temperature. We
also fit the line widths of mainly oxygen and iron lines.",2005-04-12T07:53:53Z
"The photometric evolution of FU Orionis objects: disc instability and
  wind-envelope interaction","We present the results of a photometric monitoring campaign of three well
studied FU Orionis systems (FU Orionis, V1057 Cygni and V1515 Cygni) undertaken
at Maidanak Observatory between 1981 and 2003. When combined with photometric
data in the literature, this database provides a valuable resource for
searching for short timescale variability - both periodic and aperiodic - as
well as for studying the secular evolution of these systems. In the case of
V1057 Cyg (which is the system exhibiting the largest changes in brightness
since it went into outburst) we compare the photometric data with time
dependent models. We show that prior to the end of the `plateau' stage in 1996,
the evolution of V1057 Cyg in the $V-(B-V)$ colour-magnitude diagram is well
represented by disc instability models in which the outburst is triggered by
some agent - such as an orbiting planet - in the inner disc. Following the end
of the plateau phase in 1996, the dimming and irregular variations are
consistent with occultation of the source by a variable dust screen, which has
previously been interpreted in terms of dust condensation events in the
observed disc wind. Here we instead suggest that this effect results from the
interaction between the wind and an infalling dusty envelope, the existence of
this envelope having been previously invoked in order to explain the mid
infrared emissio of FU Orionis systems. We discuss how this model may explain
some of the photometric and spectroscopic characteristics of FU Orionis systems
in general.",2005-05-25T16:23:51Z
Red clump distances to the inner Galactic structures,"The least well known structure of the Galaxy is its central region, because
of the high extinction, the crowding and the confusion between disk and bulge
sources along the line of sight. We show how the structure of the inner Galaxy
and the dust distribution can be strongly constrained by using red clump stars
as distance indicator. The results of this method applied on the deep
near-infrared survey of the inner Galactic bulge made with the Cambridge
Infrared Survey Instrument (CIRSI) are presented.",2005-06-17T14:27:15Z
"Observation and modeling of anomalous CN polarization profiles produced
  by the molecular Paschen-Back effect in sunspots","We report novel spectropolarimetric observations of sunspots carried out with
the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP) in a near-IR spectral region around
15410 A, which is known to contain two groups of prominent OH lines that show
circular polarization signals of opposite polarity. Surrounding these
well-known OH lines, we have discovered the presence of CN lines of the $\Delta
v=1$ band which show anomalous polarization profiles. Although the Stokes V
signals of the OH lines are antisymmetric and with a sizable amplitude, the CN
lines show almost negligible circular polarization. On the contrary, the linear
polarization signals turn out to be much stronger in the CN lines than in the
OH lines. Interestingly, these CN lines present striking antisymmetric linear
polarization profiles, which we are able to explain and model via the
Paschen-Back effect theory for diatomic molecules. The presence of such
peculiar CN lines in the same spectral region of the OH lines may be useful to
improve our empirical knowledge of solar magnetic fields via the simultaneous
observation and modeling of the transverse and longitudinal Zeeman effects in
two different molecular species.",2005-05-04T15:48:17Z
"Search for localized excess fluxes in Auger sky maps and prescription
  results","Using the first surface detector data of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we
present the results of a blind search for overdensities in the cosmic ray flux
with respect to isotropic expectations. We consider two energy bands: 1<E<5 EeV
and E>5 EeV at two angular scales: 5$^\circ$ and 15$^\circ$. We also report the
results of searches for excesses in target directions already defined in a set
of prescriptions presented at the ICRC in 2003. Both analyses give results that
are compatible with isotropy.",2005-07-26T13:33:55Z
Time-Variable Complex Metal Absorption Lines in the Quasar HS1603+3820,"We present a new spectrum of the quasar HS1603+3820 taken 1.28 years (0.36
years in the quasar rest frame) after a previous observation with Subaru+HDS.
The new spectrum enables us to search for time variability as an identifier of
intrinsic narrow absorption lines (NALs). This quasar shows a rich complex of C
IV NALs within 60,000 km/s of the emission redshift. Based on covering factor
analysis, Misawa et al. found that the C IV NAL system at z_abs= 2.42--2.45
(System A, at a shift velocity of v_sh = 8,300--10,600 km/s relative to the
quasar) was intrinsic to the quasar. With our new spectrum, we perform time
variability analysis as well as covering factor analysis to separate intrinsic
NALs from intervening NALs for 8 C IV systems. Only System A, which was
identified as an intrinsic system in the earlier paper by Misawa et al., shows
a strong variation in line strength (W_obs ~ 10.4A -> 19.1A). We speculate that
a broad absorption line (BAL) could be forming in this quasar. We illustrate
the plausibility of this suggestion with the help of a simulation. Under the
assumption that a change of ionization state causes the variability, a lower
limit can be placed on the electron density (n_e > 3x10^4 cm^-3) and an upper
limit on the distance from the continuum source (r < 6 kpc). On the other hand,
if the motion of clumpy gas causes the variability (a more likely scenario),
the crossing velocity and the distance from the continuum source are estimated
to be v_cross > 8,000 km/s and r < 3 pc. In this case, the absorber does not
intercept any flux from the broad emission line region, but only flux from the
UV continuum source. If we adopt the dynamical model of Murray et al., we can
obtain a much more strict constraint on the distance of the gas parcel from the
continuum source, r < 0.2 pc.",2005-04-29T14:29:12Z
Deep ACS Imaging of the Halo of NGC 5128: Reaching the Horizontal Branch,"Using the HST Wide Field Camera of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), we
have obtained deep (V,I) photometry of an outer-halo field in NGC 5128, to a
limiting magnitude of I~29. Our photometry directly reveals the core
helium-burning stellar population (the ``red clump'' or horizontal branch) in a
giant E/S0 galaxy for the first time.
  The color-magnitude diagram displays a very wide red giant branch (RGB), an
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) bump, and the red clump; no noticeable population
of blue HB stars is present, confirming previous suggestions that old, very
metal-poor population is not ubiquitous in the halo of this galaxy. From the
upper RGB we derive the metallicity distribution, which we find to be very
broad and moderately metal-rich, with average [M/H]=-0.64 and dispersion 0.49
dex. The MDF is virtually identical to that found in other halo fields observed
previously with the HST, but with an enhanced metal-rich population which was
partially missed in the previous surveys due to V-band incompleteness for these
very red stars. Combining the metallicity sensitive colors of the RGB stars
with the metallicity and age sensitive features of the AGB bump and the red
clump, we infer the average age of the halo stars to be 8^{+3}_{-3.5} Gy.
  As part of our study, we present an empirical calibration of the ACS F606W
and F814W filters to the standard V and I bands, achieved with ground-based
observations of the same field made from the EMMI camera of the New Technology
Telescope of the ESO La Silla Observatory.",2005-05-31T14:42:11Z
"Zn and Cr abundances in damped Lyman alpha systems from the CORALS
  survey","We present metal abundances in 15 damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) from the
Complete Optical and Radio Absorption Line System (CORALS) survey, designed to
be free from any biasing effects due to extinction of QSOs by dust in
intervening absorbers. It has long been suggested that such biasing may explain
differences in metallicity between DLAs and coeval luminous galaxies, and
between model predictions and observations. We use our measured zinc and
chromium abundances (combined with those for five more CORALS DLAs from the
literature, giving us a very nearly complete sample) to test whether the
metallicity and degree of dust depletion in CORALS DLAs are significantly
different from those of existing, larger, samples of DLAs drawn from magnitude
limited, optical surveys. We find that the column density weighted metallicity
of CORALS DLAs, [<(Zn/H)_DLA>] = -0.88 +/- 0.21 in the redshift interval 1.86 <
z(abs) < 3.45, is only marginally higher than that of a control sample from the
recent compilation by Kulkarni et al., [<(Zn/H)_DLA>] = -1.09 +/- 0.10. With
the present limited statistics this difference is not highly significant.
Furthermore, we find no evidence for increased dust depletions in CORALS
DLAs--their [Cr/Zn] ratios conform to the known trend of increasing depletion
(decreasing [Cr/Zn]) with increasing metallicity, and we have encountered no
cases where Cr is as depleted as in local cold interstellar clouds. These
results, when combined with the earlier findings of the CORALS survey reported
by Ellison et al. in 2001, make it difficult to invoke a dust-induced bias to
explain the generally low level of chemical evolution exhibited by most DLAs.
Rather, they indicate that large scale optical QSO surveys give a fair census
of the population of high redshift absorbers.",2005-06-08T20:00:13Z
Extensive air showers without muon component,"Extensive air showers of cosmic rays with energies above 5.10**18 eV
registered by the Yakutsk array have been analyzed. The existence of showers
without muon component is found. Among them we found 5 clusters and these
clusters correlate with nearest pulsars. It is found that there exist 4 classes
of showers. Showers with high content of muons are mainly observed at E>
4.10**19 eV and they are formed most likely by heavy nuclei.",2005-07-28T21:56:56Z
The Cooling of Compact Stars,"The cooling of a compact star depends very sensitively on the state of dense
matter at supranuclear densities, which essentially controls the neutrino
emission, as well as on the structure of the stellar outer layers which control
the photon emission. Open issues concern the hyperon population, the presence
of meson condensates, superfluidity and superconductivity, and the transition
of confined hadronic matter to quark matter. This paper describes these issues
and presents cooling calculations based on a broad collection of equations of
state for neutron star matter and strange matter. These results are tested
against the body of observed cooling data.",2005-08-01T23:24:52Z
"A simple parameterization of the consequences of deleptonization for
  simulations of stellar core collapse","A simple and computationally efficient parameterization of the
deleptonization, the entropy changes, and the neutrino stress is presented for
numerical simulations of stellar core collapse. The parameterization of the
neutrino physics is based on a bounce profile of the electron fraction as it
results from state-of-the-art collapse simulations with multi-group Boltzmann
neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. Two additional parameters include an
average neutrino escape energy and a neutrino trapping density. The
parameterized simulations reproduce the consequences of the delicate neutrino
thermalization/diffusion process during the collapse phase and provide a by far
more realistic alternative to the adiabatic approximation, which has often been
used in the investigation of the emission of gravitational waves, of
multi-dimensional general relativistic effects, of the evolution of magnetic
fields, or even of the nucleosynthesis in simulations of core collapse and
bounce. For supernova codes that are specifically designed for the postbounce
phase, the parameterization builds a convenient bridge between the point where
the applicability of a stellar evolution code ends and the point where the
postbounce evolution begins.",2005-04-04T15:44:42Z
"Three active M dwarfs within 8 pc: L 449-1, L 43-72, & LP 949-15","Three nearby star candidates were selected as bright 2MASS point sources
without associated optical sources, i.e. with potentially large proper motions,
subsequently confirmed by multi-epoch optical data from the SuperCOSMOS Sky
Surveys. All three objects are listed in the NLTT catalogue of high proper
motion stars. Follow-up spectroscopic observations allowed us to classify L
449-1 as M4.0e dwarf at 5.7 pc, L43-72 as M4.5e dwarf at 7.2 pc, and LP 949-15
as M5.0e dwarf at 6.1 pc, using known absolute $JHK_\mathrm{s}$ magnitudes of
dwarfs with corresponding spectral types, respectively. All three stars exhibit
$H{\alpha}$ emission lines, and all three can be identified with bright X-ray
sources. The available ROSAT light curves of two of the objects show typical
flare-like variability. Thus, all three stars are active, very close potential
neighbours of the Sun, previously not mentioned as such, certainly deserving
further attention. In particular, these are very promising candidates for
trigonometric parallax programs.",2005-05-12T08:01:46Z
"An Efficient Numerical Scheme for Simulating Particle Acceleration in
  Evolving Cosmic-Ray Modified Shocks","We have developed a new, very efficient numerical scheme to solve the CR
diffusion convection equation that can be applied to the study of the nonlinear
time evolution of CR modified shocks for arbitrary spatial diffusion
properties. The efficiency of the scheme derives from its use of coarse-grained
finite momentum volumes. This approach has enabled us, using $\sim 10 - 20$
momentum bins spanning nine orders of magnitude in momentum, to carry out
simulations that agree well with results from simulations of modified shocks
carried out with our conventional finite difference scheme requiring more than
an order of magnitude more momentum points. The coarse-grained, CGMV scheme
reduces execution times by a factor approximately half the ratio of momentum
bins used in the two methods. Depending on the momentum dependence of the
diffusion, additional economies in required spatial and time resolution can be
utilized in the CGMV scheme, as well. These allow a computational speed-up of
at least an order of magnitude in some cases.",2005-06-09T18:55:48Z
"Discovery and Monitoring of the likely IR Counterpart of SGR 1806-20
  during the 2004 gamma-ray burst-active state","The sky region including the Chandra position of SGR 1806-20 was monitored in
the IR band during 2004, following its increased high energy bursting activity.
Observations were performed using NAOS-CONICA, the adaptive optics IR camera
mounted on Yepun VLT, which provided images of unprecedented quality (FWHM
better than 0.1""). After the 2004 December 27th giant flare, the source
position has been nailed by VLA observations of its radio counterpart, reducing
the positional uncertainty to 0.04"". Using IR data from our monitoring
campaign, we discovered the likely IR counterpart to SGR 1806-20 based on
positional coincidence with the Chandra and VLA uncertainty regions and flux
variability of a factor of about 2 correlated with that at higher energies. We
compare our findings with other isolated neutron star classes thought to be
related, at some level, with SGRs.",2005-06-04T17:39:07Z
"Evidence of polarisation in the prompt gamma-ray emission from GRB
  930131 and GRB 960924","The true nature of the progenitor to GRBs remains elusive; one characteristic
that would constrain our understanding of the GRB mechanism considerably is
gamma-ray polarimetry measurements of the initial burst flux. We present a
method that interprets the prompt GRB flux as it Compton scatters off the
Earth's atmosphere, based on detailed modelling of both the Earth's atmosphere
and the orbiting detectors. The BATSE mission aboard the \textit{CGRO}
monitored the whole sky in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy band continuously from
April 1991 until June 2000. We present the BATSE Albedo Polarimetry System
(BAPS), and show that GRB 930131 and GRB 960924 provide evidence of
polarisation in their prompt flux that is consistent with degrees of
polarisation of $\Pi>35$% and $\Pi>50$% respectively. While the evidence of
polarisation is strong, the method is unable to strongly constrain the degree
of polarisation beyond a systematics based estimation. Hence the implications
on GRB theory are unclear, and further measurements essential.",2005-05-05T14:02:32Z
"Characterizing the Shapes of Galaxy Clusters Using Moments of the
  Gravitational Lensing Shear","We explore the use of the tangential component of weak lensing shear to
characterize the ellipticity of clusters of galaxies. We introduce an
ellipticity estimator, and quantify its properties for isolated clusters from
LCDM N-body simulations. We compare the N-body results to results from smooth
analytic models. The expected distribution of the estimator for mock
observations is presented, and we show how this distribution is impacted by
contaminants such as noise, line of sight projections, and misalignment of the
central galaxy used to determine the orientation of the triaxial halo. We
examine the radial profile of the estimator and discuss tradeoffs in the
observational strategy to determine cluster shape.",2005-08-03T23:06:22Z
"Temperature fluctuations in HII regions: ionization by Cosmic Rays as a
  key mechanism","We present a detailed model capable of explaining quantitatively the
temperature fluctuations observed in luminous, large HII regions. The model is
based on two assumptions which we justify on the basis of observations: that
the major fraction of the hydrogen in the clouds that form the HII regions is
not photoionized and is essentially HI, this HII is lightly ionized by fluxes
of low energy cosmic rays (CR) produced by processes originating in the hot
stars which illuminate the regions.",2005-05-18T12:19:34Z
Burst Neutrinos from Nitrogen Flash,"Neutrinos give a novel probe to explore deep interior of astrophysical
objects, which otherwise is not accessible with optical observations; among
notable examples are solar and supernova neutrinos. We show that there is a new
class of strong neutrino emission from helium burning, N + alpha --> 18F gamma
followed by beta decay 18F --> 18O + e+ + nu_e, that gives a maximum neutrino
luminosity of 10^8 times the solar bolometric luminosity at the helium-core
flash of a 1 M_sun star, whereas the flash is not observable by optical means.
This means that the neutrino flux, of average energy of 0.382 MeV, will be 10%
the solar CNO neutrino flux on Earth if the star is located at 10pc.",2005-05-16T22:15:33Z
"The 2MASS Wide-Field T Dwarf Search. IV Unting out T dwarfs with Methane
  Imaging","We present first results from a major program of methane filter photometry
for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The definition of a new methane filter
photometric system is described. A recipe is provided for the differential
calibration of methane imaging data using existing 2MASS photometry. We show
that these filters are effective in discriminating T dwarfs from other types of
stars, and demonstrate this with Anglo-Australian Telescope observations using
the IRIS2 imager. Methane imaging data and proper motions are presented for ten
T dwarfs identified as part of the 2MASS ""Wide Field T Dwarf Search"" -- seven
of them initially identified as T dwarfs using methane imaging.
  We also present near-infrared moderate resolution spectra for five T dwarfs,
newly discovered by this technique. Spectral types obtained from these spectra
are compared to those derived from both our methane filter observations, and
spectral types derived by other observers. Finally, we suggest a range of
future programs to which these filters are clearly well suited: the winnowing
of T dwarf and Y dwarf candidate objects coming from the next generation of
near-infrared sky surveys; the robust detection of candidate planetary-mass
brown dwarfs in clusters; the detection of T dwarf companions to known L and T
dwarfs via deep methane imaging; and the search for rotationally-modulated
time-variable surface features on cool brown dwarfs.",2005-08-05T08:06:57Z
Spherical Collapse Model And Dark Energy(I),"In existing literatures about the top-hat spherical collapse model of galaxy
clusters formation in cosmology containing dark energies, dark energies are
usually assumed not to cluster on this scale. But all these literatures ignored
the current describing the flowing of dark energies outside the clusters which
should exist under this assumption, so the conclusions of these literatures are
worth further explorations. In this paper we study this model in QCDM or
Phantom-CDM cosmologies(flat) by assuming that dark energies will cluster
synchronously with ordinary matters on the scale of galaxy clusters so the dark
energy current flowing outside the clusters does not exist at all and find that
in this case, the key parameters of the model exhibit rather non-trivial and
remarkable dependence on the equation of state coefficients of dark energies.
We then apply the results in
  Press-Scheter theory and calculate the number density of galaxy clusters and
its evolutions. We find that this two quantities are both affected
exponentially by the equation of state coefficients of dark energies. We leave
the study of this model with the assumption that dark energies do not cluster
on the scale of galaxy clusters at all as the topic of another paper where
similar conclusions will be obtained also.",2005-05-09T13:34:13Z
"Ionization fronts and their interaction with density fluctuations:
  implications for reionization","The propagation of cosmological ionization fronts (I-fronts) during
reionization is strongly influenced by small-scale structure. Here we summarize
our recent attemps to understand the effect of this small-scale structure. We
present high resolution cosmological N-body simulations at high-z (z>6) which
resolve a wide range of halo mass, from minihalos to clusters of large, rare
halos. We also study how minihalos affect I-fronts, through simulations of
minihalo photoevaporation. Furthermore, we modify the I-front propagation
equations to account for evolving small-scale structure, and incorporate these
results into a semi-analytical reionization model. When intergalactic medium
clumping and minihalo clustering around sources are included, small-scale
structure affects reionization by slowing it down and extending it in time.
This helps to explain observations by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe,
which imply an early and extended reionization epoch. We also study how source
clustering affects the evolution and size of H II regions, finding, in
agreement with simulations, that H II regions usually expand, rarely shrinking.
Hence, ""relic H II regions'' are an exception, rather than the rule. When the
suppression of small-mass sources in already-ionized regions by Jeans-mass
filtering is accounted for, H II regions are smaller, delaying overlap. We also
present a new numerical method for radiative transfer which is fast, efficient,
and easily coupled to hydrodynamics and N-body codes, along with sample tests
and applications.",2005-05-06T19:37:45Z
X-ray emission from young brown dwarfs in the Orion Nebula Cluster,"We use the sensitive X-ray data from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project
(COUP) to study the X-ray properties of 34 spectroscopically-identified brown
dwarfs with near-infrared spectral types between M6 and M9 in the core of the
Orion Nebula Cluster. Nine of the 34 objects are clearly detected as X-ray
sources. The apparently low detection rate is in many cases related to the
substantial extinction of these brown dwarfs; considering only the BDs with
$A_V \leq 5$ mag, nearly half of the objects (7 out of 16) are detected in
X-rays. Our 10-day long X-ray lightcurves of these objects exhibit strong
variability, including numerous flares. While one of the objects was only
detected during a short flare, a statistical analysis of the lightcurves
provides evidence for continuous (`quiescent') emission in addition to flares
for all other objects. Of these, the $\sim$ M9 brown dwarf COUP 1255 = HC 212
is one of the coolest known objects with a clear detection of quiescent X-ray
emission. The X-ray properties (spectra, fractional X-ray luminosities, flare
rates) of these young brown dwarfs are similar to those of the low-mass stars
in the ONC, and thus there is no evidence for changes in the magnetic activity
around the stellar/substellar boundary, which lies at $\sim$ M6 for ONC
sources. Since the X-ray properties of the young brown dwarfs are also similar
to those of M6--M9 field stars, the key to the magnetic activity in very cool
objects seems to be the effective temperature, which determines the degree of
ionization in the atmosphere.",2005-06-02T08:40:21Z
The Discovery of Spiral Arms in the Starburst Galaxy M82,"We report the discovery of two symmetric spiral arms in the near-infrared
(NIR) images of the starburst galaxy M82. The spiral arms are recovered when an
axi-symmetric exponential disk is subtracted from the NIR images. The arms
emerge from the ends of the NIR bar and can be traced up to three disk
scalelengths. The winding of the arms is consistent with an m=2 logarithmic
spiral mode of pitch angle 14 degrees. The arms are bluer than the disk in
spite of their detection on the NIR images. If the northern side of the galaxy
is nearer to us, as is normally assumed, the observed sense of rotation implies
trailing arms. The nearly edge-on orientation, high disk surface brightness,
and the presence of a complex network of dusty filaments in the optical images,
are responsible for the lack of detection of the arms in previous studies.",2005-06-13T15:34:25Z
The very local Hubble flow: Simulating transition from chaos to order,"The physical nature of the very local (<3 Mpc) Hubble flow is studied on the
basis of the recent high precision observations in the Local Volume. A model
including both analytical treatment and computer simulations describes the flow
dynamical evolution from a chaotic Little Bang initial state to the present-day
state of a quasi-regular expansion. The two major observational parameters of
the flow, which are the rate of expansion and the velocity dispersion, find a
clear qualitative and quantitative explanation in the model.",2005-07-15T06:37:41Z
"Jet Formation in Black Hole Accretion Systems I: Theoretical Unification
  Model","Two types of relativistic jets are suggested to form near accreting black
holes: a potentially ultrarelativistic Poynting-dominated jet and a
Poynting-baryon jet. One source of jet matter is electron-positron pair
production, which is driven by neutrino annihilation in GRBs and photon
annihilation in AGN and x-ray binaries. GRB Poynting-dominated jets are also
loaded by electron-proton pairs by the collisional cascade of Fick-diffused
free neutrons. We show that, for the collapsar model, the neutrino-driven
enthalpy flux (classic fireball model) is probably dominated by the
Blandford-Znajek energy flux, which predicts a jet Lorentz factor of
$\Gamma\sim 100-1000$. We show that radiatively inefficient AGN, such as M87,
are synchrotron-cooling limited to $\Gamma\sim 2-10$. Radiatively efficient
x-ray binaries, such as GRS1915+105, are Compton-drag limited to $\Gamma
\lesssim 2$, but the jet may be destroyed by Compton drag. However, the
Poynting-baryon jet is a collimated outflow with $\Gamma \sim 1-3$. The jet
from radiatively efficient systems, such as microquasar GRS1915+105, may
instead be a Poynting-baryon jet that is only relativistic when the disk is
geometrically thick. In a companion paper, general relativistic hydromagnetic
simulations of black hole accretion with pair creation are used to simulate jet
formation in GRBs, AGN, and x-ray binaries.",2005-06-16T06:16:33Z
Wiggly cosmic strings accrete dark energy,"This paper deals with a study of the cylindrically symmetric accretion of
dark energy with equation of state $p=w\rho$ onto wiggly straight cosmic
strings. We have obtained that when $w>-1$ the linear energy density in the
string core gradually increases tending to a finite maximum value as time
increases for all considered dark energy models. On the regime where the
dominant energy condition is violated all such models predict a steady
decreasing of the linear energy density of the cosmic strings as phantom energy
is being accreted. The final state of the string after such an accretion
process is a wiggleless defect. It is argued however that if accreation of
phantom energy would proceed by successive quantum steps then the defect would
continue losing linear energy density until a minimum nonzero value which can
be quite smaller than that corresponding to the unperturbed string.",2005-06-29T09:26:33Z
Preheating by Previrialization and its Impact on Galaxy Formation,"We use recent observations of the HI-mass function to constrain galaxy
formation. The data conflicts with the standard model where most of the gas in
a low-mass dark matter halo is assumed to settle into a disk of cold gas that
is depleted by star formation and supernova-driven outflows until the disk
becomes gravitationally stable. A consistent model can be found if low-mass
haloes are embedded in a preheated medium, with a specific gas entropy ~ 10Kev
cm^2. Such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxy
luminosity function. We propose a preheating model where the medium around
low-mass haloes is preheated by gravitational pancaking. Since gravitational
tidal fields suppress the formation of low-mass haloes while promoting that of
pancakes, the formation of massive pancakes precedes that of the low-mass
haloes within them. We demonstrate that the progenitors of present-day dark
matter haloes with M<10^{12}h^{-1}\msun were embedded in pancakes of masses
$~5x10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$ at z~2. The formation of such pancakes heats the gas to
a temperature of 5x10^5K and compresses it to an overdensity of ~10. Such gas
has a cooling time that exceeds the age of the Universe at z~2, and has a
specific entropy of ~15Kev cm^2, almost exactly the amount required to explain
the stellar and HI mass functions. (Abridged)",2005-06-21T22:50:09Z
"Doppler imaging of Speedy Mic using the VLT, Fast spot evolution on a
  young K-dwarf star","We study the short-term evolution of starspots on the ultrafast-rotating star
HD197890 (""Speedy Mic"" = BO Mic, K 0-2V, P_rot = 0.380 d) based on two Doppler
images taken about 13 stellar rotations apart. Each image is based on spectra
densely sampling a single stellar rotation. The images were reconstructed by
our Doppler imaging code CLDI (Clean-like Doppler imaging) from line profiles
extracted by spectrum deconvolution. Our Doppler images constructed from two
independent wavelength ranges agree well on scales down to 10 degrees on the
stellar surface. In conjunction with nearly parallel V-band photometry our
observations reveal a significant evolution of the spot pattern during as
little as two stellar rotations. We suggest that such a fast spot evolution
demands care when constructing Doppler images of highly active stars based on
spectral time series extending over several stellar rotations. The fast
intrinsic spot evolution on BO Mic impedes the determination of a surface
differential rotation; in agreement with earlier results by other authors we
determine an upper limit of |alpha| < 0.004 +- 0.002.",2005-04-05T13:03:29Z
Using ACT arrays as Intensity Interferometers,"The Narrabri intensity interferometer was successfully used until 1974 to
observe 32 stars, all brighter than B=+2.5, among which some were found to have
an angular diameter as small as 0.41+/-0.03 milli-arc-seconds (mas). The
technique was then abandoned in favor of Michelson interferometry. Here we
consider the technical feasibility and scientific potential of implementing
intensity interferometry on Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope arrays. The
scientific motivations are varied, including stellar diameter measurements and
investigations of the circumstellar environment. Long baselines and short
wavelengths are easily accesible to this technique, making it uniquely suited
for some applications.",2005-07-01T00:43:19Z
"UHE Leptons and Neutrons feeding Precessing gamma Jet in GRBs - SGRs: A
  SGR 1806-20 link to EeV C.R.?","Soft Gamma Repeaters are widely believed to occur as isotropic Magnetar
explosion. We suggest on the contrary that they may be described by thin
collimated spinning and precessing Gamma Jets flashing and blazing along the
line of sight. The Jet (for SGRs) maybe powered by an accretion disk in binary
system and it reproduces huge outflow and oscillating blazing mode as the
observed ones in Giant Flare SGR 1806-20. The precessing and spinning blazing
nature reflects at smaller intensity the same behavior observed in brief GRBs
Jetted Supernova, as well as re-brightening and bumps in afterglows. The SGR
gamma beam maybe powered by Inverse Compton Scattering or by Synchrotron
Radiation of electron pair beam respectively at GeVs or PeVs energies. In the
latter case tens PeVs leptons (muons and later decaying PeVs electrons) might
be originated while EeV nucleons Jets (protons-neutrons) are in photo-pion
equilibrium with infrared photons surrounding the source. The neutron Jet might
survive and remain collimated. It maybe already detected as an EeV cosmic ray
anisotropy in present AGASA map pointing toward known (North Hemisphere) SGRs :
SGR 1900 +14 and SGR 1806-20. If the SGR-EeV connection is correct a parasite
traces of PeVs neutrino as well PeV-TeVs gamma rays might be found in present
or future data records, among the others C.R. array detectors, inside the
Amanda and Milagro volumes.",2005-05-09T13:53:47Z
"Water masers in the massive protostar IRAS 20126+4104: ejection and
  deceleration","We report on the first multi-epoch, phase referenced VLBI observations of the
water maser emission in a high-mass protostar associated with a disk-jet
system. The source under study, IRAS 20126+4104, has been extensively
investigated in a large variety of tracers, including water maser VLBA data
acquired by us three years before the present observations. The new findings
fully confirm the interpretation proposed in our previous study, namely that
the maser spots are expanding from a common origin coincident with the
protostar. We also demonstrate that the observed 3-D velocities of the maser
spots can be fitted with a model assuming that the spots are moving along the
surface of a conical jet, with speed increasing for increasing distance from
the cone vertex. We also present the results of single-dish monitoring of the
water maser spectra in IRAS 20126+4104. These reveal that the peak velocity of
some maser lines decreases linearly with time. We speculate that such a
deceleration could be due to braking of the shocks from which the maser
emission originates, due to mass loading at the shock front or dissipation of
the shock energy.",2005-04-25T14:49:21Z
"Ultraviolet, Optical, and X-Ray Observations of the Type Ia Supernova
  2005am with Swift","We present ultraviolet and optical light curves in six broadband filters and
grism spectra obtained by Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope for the Type Ia
supernova SN2005am. The data were collected beginning about four days before
the B-band maximum, with excellent coverage of the rapid decline phase and
later observations extending out to 69 days after the peak. The optical and
near UV light curve match well those of SN1992A. The other UV observations
constitute the first set of light curves shorter than 2500 Angstroms and allow
us to compare the light curve evolution in three UV bands. The UV behavior of
this and other low redshift supernovae can be used to constrain theories of
progenitor evolution or to interpret optical light curves of high redshift
supernovae. Using Swift's X-Ray Telescope, we also report the upper limit to
SN2005am's X-ray luminosity to be 1.77 x 10^40 erg s^-1 in the 0.3--10 keV
range from 58,117 s of exposure time.",2005-06-01T19:21:30Z
The high-velocity clouds and the Magellanic Clouds,"From an analysis of the sky and velocity distributions of the high-velocity
clouds (HVCs) we show that the majority of the HVCs has a common origin. We
conclude that the HVCs surround the Galaxy, forming a metacloud of 300 kpc in
size and with a mass of 3 10^9 M_sun, and that they are the product of a
powerful ``superwind'' (about 10^58 ergs), which occurred in the Magellanic
Clouds about 570 Myr ago as a consequence of the interaction of the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds. The HVCs might be magnetic bubbles of semi-ionized
gas, blown from the Magellanic Clouds around 570 Myr ago, that circulate
largely through the halo of the Galaxy as a stream or flow of gas.",2005-05-31T23:01:16Z
Observational studies of stellar black hole binaries and ULXs,"We outline a framework for understanding the X-ray spectra of high mass
accretion rate stellar black holes based on X-ray data from RXTE and ASCA.
Three spectral regimes can be separated out by the behaviour of the observed
disk luminosity and temperature. The well established ""standard regime"" is seen
when the disk dominates the spectrum, where only a small fraction of the
luminosity is emitted in the power law tail. These spectra generally satisfy
the standard relation expected for thermal emission from a constant area,
namely that the disk bolometric luminosity, Ldisk, is proportional to its
maximum temperature, Tin^4. However, at higher luminosities this starts to
change to Tin^2. This ""apparently standard regime"" is still dominated by the
disk emission, but this difference luminosity-temperature relation and subtle
changes in spectral shape may show that another cooling process is required in
addition to radiative cooling. At intermediate luminosities there is an
anomalous regime (or weak very high state) where the disk temperature and
luminosity are less clearly related. These spectra are characterized by the
presence of a much stronger comptonized tail indicating high energy electrons.
When observed disk emission is corrected for the the effects of comptonisation
then these points lie back on the standard relation. The growth of this
comptonising corona is also clearly linked to the quasi-periodic oscillations,
as these are observed preferentially in the anomalous regime. This presented
picture was found to explain the spectral behavior of both black hole binaries
in our Galaxy and LMC. Spectral evolution of several bright ULXs observed with
ASCA were also successfully explained in the same picture.",2005-07-12T03:45:50Z
The effect of neutrinos on the initial fireballs in gamma-ray bursts,"We investigate the fate of very compact, sudden energy depositions that may
lie at the origin of gamma-ray bursts. Following on from the work of Cavallo
and Rees (1978), we take account of the much higher energies now believed to be
involved. The main effect of this is that thermal neutrinos are present and
energetically important. We show that these may provide sufficient cooling to
tap most of the explosion energy. However, at the extreme energies usually
invoked for gamma-ray bursts, the neutrino opacity suffices to prevent dramatic
losses, provided that the heating process is sufficiently fast. In a generic
case, a few tens of percent of the initial fireball energy will escape as an
isotropic millisecond burst of thermal neutrinos with a temperature of about 60
MeV, which is detectable for nearby gamma-ray bursts and hypernovae. For
parameters we find most likely for gamma-ray burst fireballs, the dominant
processes are purely leptonic, and thus the baryon loading of the fireball does
not affect our conclusions.",2005-05-26T12:28:13Z
On the large-angle anomalies of the microwave sky,"[Abridged] We apply the multipole vector framework to full-sky maps derived
from the first year WMAP data. We significantly extend our earlier work showing
that the two lowest cosmologically interesting multipoles, l=2 and 3, are not
statistically isotropic. These results are compared to the findings obtained
using related methods. In particular, the planes of the quadrupole and the
octopole are unexpectedly aligned. Moreover, the combined quadrupole plus
octopole is surprisingly aligned with the geometry and direction of motion of
the solar system: the plane they define is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane
and to the plane defined by the dipole direction, and the ecliptic plane
carefully separates stronger from weaker extrema, running within a couple of
degrees of the null-contour between a maximum and a minimum over more than
120deg of the sky. Even given the alignment of the quadrupole and octopole with
each other, we find that their alignment with the ecliptic is unlikely at >98%
C.L., and argue that it is in fact unlikely at >99.9% C.L. We explore the role
of foregrounds showing that the known Galactic foregrounds are unlikely to lead
to these correlations. Multipole vectors, like individual a_lm, are very
sensitive to sky cuts, and we demonstrate that analyses using cut skies induce
relatively large errors, thus weakening the observed correlations but
preserving their consistency with the full-sky results. Finally we apply our
tests to COBE cut-sky maps and briefly extend the analysis to higher
multipoles. If the correlations we observe are indeed a signal of non-cosmic
origin, then the lack of low-l power will very likely be exacerbated, with
important consequences for our understanding of cosmology on large scales.",2005-08-01T20:07:39Z
"HST and UKIRT Observations of the Center of the Trifid Nebula: Evidence
  for the Photoevaporation of a Proplyd and a Protostellar Condensation","The Trifid nebula (M20) is a well-known prominent optical HII region
trisected by bands of obscuring dust lanes and excited by an O7.5 star HD
164492A. Previous near-IR, mid-IR and radio continuum observations of the
cluster of stars at the center of the Trifid nebula indicated circumstellar
disks associated with hot stars with envelopes that are photoionized externally
by the UV radiation from the hot central star, HD 164492A. Using WFPC2 of the
HST, we present evidence of a resolved proplyd in H$\alpha$ and [SII] line
emission from a stellar source emitting cool dust emission. Using UKIRT, an
infrared observation of the stellar source with a proplyd indicates a late F --
mid G spectral type. We also note a remarkable complex of filamentary and
sheet-like structures which appear to arise from the edge of a protostellar
condensation. These observations are consistent with a picture in which the
bright massive star HD 164492A is responsible for the photoevaporation of
protoplanetary disks of other less-massive members of the cluster as well as
the closest protostellar condensation facing the central cluster. Using the
evidence for a proplyd, we argue that the massive and intermediate mass members
of the cluster, HD 164492C (B6 star) and HD 164492 (Herbig Be star) have disks
associated with them.",2005-05-08T17:04:32Z
The Physics of Flames in Type Ia Supernovae,"We extend a low Mach number hydrodynamics method developed for terrestrial
combustion, to the study of thermonuclear flames in Type Ia supernovae. We
discuss the differences between 2-D and 3-D Rayleigh-Taylor unstable flame
simulations, and give detailed diagnostics on the turbulence, showing that the
kinetic energy power spectrum obeys Bolgiano-Obukhov statistics in 2-D, but
Kolmogorov statistics in 3-D. Preliminary results from 3-D reacting bubble
calculations are shown, and their implications for ignition are discussed.",2005-07-01T20:09:42Z
Asteroseismic diagrams for solar-type stars,"We explore the feasibility of applying the Christensen-Dalsgaard diagram to
real asteroseismic data and provide quantitative measures of the uncertainty
associated with the results. We also propose a new kind of seismic diagram,
based on the determination of the locations of sharp acoustic features inside a
star. We show that by combining the information about the position of the base
of the convective envelope or the HeII ionisation zone with a measure of the
average large separation, it is possible to constrain the unknown chemical
composition or the various parameters characterising the physical processes in
the stellar interior. We demonstrate the application of this technique to the
analysis of mock data for a CoRoT target star.",2005-07-04T19:13:27Z
"The Hamburg/SAO survey for emission-line galaxies. VI. The sixth list of
  126 galaxies","We present the sixth list with results of the Hamburg/SAO Survey for
Emission-Line Galaxies. The final list resulted from follow-up spectroscopy
conducted with the 4.5m MMT telescope in 1996, and with 2.2m CAHA and 6m SAO
telescopes in 2000 to 2003. The data of this snap-shot spectroscopy survey
confirmed 134 emission-line objects out of 182 observed candidates and allowed
their quantitative spectral classification and redshift determination. We
classify 73 emission-line objects as definite or probable blue compact or HII
galaxies (BCG), 8 as QSOs, 4 as Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies. 30 low-excitation
objects were classified as definite or probable starburst nuclei (SBN), 3 as
dwarf amorphous nuclei starburst galaxies (DANS) and 2 as LINERs. Due to the
low signal-to-noise ratio we could not classify 14 ELGs (NON). For another 9
galaxies we did not detect any significant emission lines. For 98 emission-line
galaxies, the redshifts and/or line intensities are determined for the first
time. For the remaining 28 previously-known ELGs we give either improved data
the line intensities or some independent measurements. The detection rate of
ELGs is ~70%. This paper completes the classification of strong-lined ELGs
found in the zone of the Hamburg/SAO survey. Together with previously known
BCG/HII galaxies in this zone, this sample of ~500 objects is the largest to
date in a well bound region.",2005-07-05T09:06:23Z
SAPAC: a SBF analysis pipeline for the astronomical community,"Large volumes of CCD imaging data that will become available from wide-field

future are highly suitable for systematic distance surveys of early-type
galaxies using the Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) method. For the
efficient processing of such large data sets, we are developing the first
semi-automatic SBF analysis pipeline named SAPAC. After a brief description of
the SBF method we discuss the image quality needed for a successful distance
measurement and give some background information on SAPAC",2005-08-01T04:34:05Z
"Discovery of extended VHE gamma-ray emission from the asymmetric pulsar
  wind nebula in MSH 15-52 with H.E.S.S","The Supernova Remnant MSH 15-52 has been observed in very high energy (VHE)
gamma-rays using the H.E.S.S. 4-telescope array located in Namibia. A gamma-ray
signal is detected at the 25 sigma level during an exposure of 22.1 hours live
time. The image reveals an elliptically shaped emission region around the
pulsar PSR B1509-58, with semi-major axis 6' in the NW-SE direction and
semi-minor axis 2' approximately. This morphology coincides with the diffuse
pulsar wind nebula as observed at X-ray energies by ROSAT. The overall energy
spectrum from 280 GeV up to 40 TeV can be fitted by a power law with photon
index Gamma = 2.27 +/- 0.03(stat.) +/- 0.20(syst.). The detected emission can
be plausibly explained by inverse Compton scattering of accelerated
relativistic electrons with soft photons.",2005-04-05T17:53:15Z
Global X-ray properties of the Orion Nebula region,"Based on the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) observation, we establish
the global X-ray properties of the stellar population associated with the Orion
Nebula. Three components contribute roughly equally to the integrated COUP
luminosity in the hard (2-8 keV) X-ray band: several OB stars, 822 lightly
obscured cool stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and 559 heavily obscured
stars. ONC stars 0.5-2 pc from the center show a spatial asymmetry consistent
with violent relaxation in the stellar dynamics. The obscured COUP sources
concentrate around both OMC-1 molecular cores; these small-scale structures
indicate ages t < 0.1 Myr. The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the lightly
obscured sample is roughly lognormal in shape. The obscured population is
deficient in lower-luminosity stars, perhaps due to localized circumstellar
material. Mass-stratified XLFs show that one-third of the Orion Nebula region
hard-band emission is produced by the bright O6 star theta-1 Ori C and half is
produced by lower mass pre-main sequence stars with masses 0.3 < M < 3 Mo. Very
low mass stars contribute little to the cluster X-ray emission.
  Using the hard band emission, we show that young stellar clusters like the
ONC can be readily detected and resolved with Chandra across the Galactic disk,
even in the presence of heavy obscuration. The Orion Nebula sample is a
valuable template for studies of distant clusters. For example, the peak of the
XLF shape can serve as a standard candle for a new distance measure to distant
young stellar clusters, and the presence of a neon emission line complex around
1 keV can serve as a diagnostic for young stars.",2005-06-21T17:42:27Z
X-ray properties of active M dwarfs as observed by XMM-Newton,"We present a comparative study of X-ray emission from a sample of active M
dwarfs with spectral types \hbox{M3.5 - M4.5} using XMM-Newton observations of
two single stars, AD Leonis and EV Lacertae, and two unresolved binary systems,
AT Microscopii and EQ Pegasi. The light curves reveal frequent flaring during
all four observations. We perform a uniform spectral analysis and determine
plasma temperatures, abundances and emission measures in different states of
activity. Applying multi-temperature models with variable abundances separately
to data obtained with the EPIC and RGS detectors we are able to investigate the
consistency of the results obtained by the different instruments onboard
XMM-Newton. We find that the X-ray properties of the sample M dwarfs are very
similar, with the coronal abundances of all sample stars following a trend of
increasing abundance with increasing first ionization potential, the inverse
FIP effect. The overall metallicities are below solar photospheric ones but
appear consistent with the measured photospheric abundances of M dwarfs like
these. A significant increase in the prominence of the hotter plasma components
is observed during flares while the cool plasma component is only marginally
affected by flaring, pointing to different coronal structures. AT Mic, probably
a young pre-main-sequence system, has the highest X-ray luminosity and exhibits
also the hottest corona. While results of EQ Peg and EV Lac are presented here
for the first time, AT Mic and AD Leo have been investigated before with
different analysis approaches, allowing a comparison of the results.",2005-04-06T12:01:56Z
"Morphologies of Ultracompact HII Regions in W49A and Sgr B2: Prevalence
  of Shells and a Modified Classification Scheme","We have used Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the massive star forming
regions W49A and Sgr B2, obtained with resolutions from 2\farcs0 to 0\farcs04,
to classify the morphologies of nearly 100 ultracompact HII regions. These high
resolution, multi-frequency, multi-configuration VLA observations motivate
several modifications of the existing morphological classification scheme for
UC HII regions. In this work, we describe the modified morphology scheme and
the criteria used in source classification. In particular, we drop the
``core-halo'' classification, add a ``bipolar'' classification, and change the
shell classification to ``shell-like''. We tally the percentage of each
morphology found in the Sgr B2 and W49A regions and find broad agreement with
the Galactic plane surveys in the distribution of morphologies for most types.
However, we find that nearly a third of the sources in these regions are
shell-like, which is a higher percentage by nearly a factor of ten than found
in the surveys of Galactic plane star forming regions by Wood & Churchwell
(1989a) and Kurtz et al. (1994). This difference may be due to physical
differences in the environments of these two extreme star forming regions.
Alternatively, differences in observational technique may be responsible.",2005-04-10T14:20:42Z
"Correspondence Between $5D$ Ricci-Flat Cosmological Models and
  Quintessence Dark Energy Models","We study the accelerating expansion and the induced dark energy of the $5D$
Ricci-flat universe which is characterized by having a big bounce as opposed to
a big bang. We show that the arbitrary function $\mu(t)$ contained in the $5D$
solutions can be rewritten in terms of the redshift $z$ as a new arbitrary
function $f(z)$, and we find that there is a correspondence between this $f(z)$
and the potential $V(\phi)$ of the 4D quintessence models. Using this
correspondence, the arbitrary function $f(z)$ and the $5D$ solution could be
specified for a given form of the potential $V(\phi)$.",2005-07-18T05:06:24Z
"Winds, B-Fields, and Magnetotails of Pulsars","We investigate the emission of rotating magnetized neutron stars due to the
acceleration and radiation of particles in the relativistic wind and in the
magnetotail of the star. We consider that the charged particles are accelerated
by driven collisionless reconnection. Outside of the light cylinder, the star's
rotation acts to wind up the magnetic field to form a predominantly azimuthal,
slowly decreasing with distance, magnetic field of opposite polarity on either
side of the equatorial plane normal to the star's rotation axis. The magnetic
field annihilates across the equatorial plane with the magnetic energy going to
accelerate the charged particles to relativistic energies. For a typical
supersonically moving pulsar, the star's wind extends outward to the standoff
distance with the interstellar medium. At larger distances, the power output of
pulsar's wind $\dot{E}_w$ of electromagnetic field and relativistic particles
is {\it redirected and collimated into the magnetotail} of the star. In the
magnetotail it is proposed that equipartition is reached between the magnetic
energy and the relativistic particle energy. For such conditions, synchrotron
radiation from the magnetotails may be a significant fraction of $\dot{E}_w$
for high velocity pulsars. An equation is derived for the radius of the
magnetotail $r_m(z^\prime)$ as a function of distance $z^\prime$ from the star.
For large distances $z^\prime$, of the order of the distance travelled by the
star, we argue that the magnetotail has a `trumpet' shape owing to the slowing
down of the magnetotail flow.",2005-05-13T19:28:11Z
Particle acceleration timescales in relativistic shear flows,"We review the acceleration of energetic particles in relativistic
astrophysical jets characterized by a significant velocity shear. The possible
formation of power-law momentum spectra is discussed and typical acceleration
timescales are determined for a variety of different conditions such as
parallel and azimuthal shear flows. Special attendance is given to the analysis
of parallel shear flows with either a linear decreasing or a Gaussian-type
velocity profile. It is shown that in the presence of a gradual shear flow and
a particle mean free path scaling with the gyroradius, synchrotron radiation
losses may no longer be able to stop the acceleration once it has started to
work efficiently. Finally, the relevance of shear acceleration in small- and
large-scale relativistic jets is addressed.",2005-06-29T10:35:11Z
"Astrophysical Production of Microscopic Black Holes in a Low
  Planck-scale World","In the framework of brane-world models lowering the Planck scale to the TeV
range, it has recently been pointed out that small black holes could be formed
at particle colliders or by neutrinos interactions in the atmosphere. This
article aims at reviewing other places and epochs where microscopic black holes
could be formed : the interstellar medium and the early Universe. The related
decay channels and the propagation of the emitted particles are studied to
conclude that, in spite of the large creation rate for such black holes, the
amount of produced particles do not conflict with experimental data. This
shows, from the astronomical viewpoint, that models with large extra dimensions
making the gravity scale much lower are compatible with observations.",2005-05-20T13:18:34Z
"A model for the population of helium stars in the Galaxy I. Low-mass
  stars","By means of population synthesis we model the Galactic ensemble of helium
stars. It is assumed that all helium stars are formed in binaries. Under this
assumption, single helium stars are produced by the mergers of helium remnants
of components of close binaries (mainly, by merging helium white dwarfs) and by
disruption of binaries with helium components in supernovae explosions. The
estimate of the total birthrate of helium stars in the Galaxy is 0.043
yr$^{-1}$, their total number is estimated as $4 \times 10^6$. The rate of
binarity in the total sample is 76%. We construct a subsample of low-mass
($M_{\rm He} \lesssim 2 \ms$) helium stars limited by observational selection
effects: stellar magnitude ($V_{\rm He} \leq 16$), ratio of stellar magnitudes
of components in binaries ($V_{\rm He}\leq V_{\rm comp}$), lower limit of the
semiamplitude of radial velocity that is necessary for discovery of binarity
($K_{min}=30$ km/s). The parameters of this ``observable'' sample are in
satisfactory agreement with the parameters of the observed ensemble of sdB
stars. In particular, in the selection-limited sample binarity rate is 58%. We
analyze the relations between orbital periods and masses of helium stars and
their companions in systems with different combinations of components. We
expect that overwhelming majority ($\sim 90$%) of unobserved components in
binary sdB stars are white dwarfs, predominantly, carbon-oxygen ones.",2005-04-28T13:41:17Z
"The Century Survey Galactic Halo Project II: Global Properties and the
  Luminosity Function of Field Blue Horizontal Branch Stars","We discuss a 175 deg^2 spectroscopic survey for blue horizontal branch (BHB)
stars in the Galactic halo. We use the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to select BHB candidates, and find that the
2MASS and SDSS color-selection is 38% and 50% efficient, respectively, for BHB
stars. Our samples include one likely run-away B7 star 6 kpc below the Galactic
plane. The global properties of the BHB samples are consistent with membership
in the halo population: the median metallicity is [Fe/H]=-1.7, the velocity
dispersion is 108 km/s, and the mean Galactic rotation of the BHB stars
3<|z|<15 kpc is -4 +- 30 km/s. We discuss the theoretical basis of the Preston,
Shectman & Beers M_V-color relation for BHB stars, and conclude that intrinsic
shape of the BHB M_V-color relation results from the physics of stars on the
horizontal branch. We calculate the luminosity function for the field BHB star
samples using the Efstathiou, Ellis, & Peterson maximum-likelihood method which
is unbiased by density variations. The field BHB luminosity function exhibits a
steep rise at bright luminosities, a peak between 0.8 < M_V < 1.0, and a tail
at faint luminosities. We compare the field BHB luminosity functions with the
luminosity functions derived from sixteen different globular cluster BHBs.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests suggest that field BHB stars and BHB stars in globular
clusters share a common distribution of luminosities, with the exception of
globular clusters with extended BHBs.",2005-05-16T19:57:57Z
Chemical abundances in 43 metal-poor stars,"We have derived abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni
and Ba for 43 metal-poor field stars in the solar neighbourhood with iron
abundances [Fe/H] ranging from -0.4 to -3.0. Total abundance errors are
estimated to about 0.1-0.2 dex for most elements, while relative abundances are
most probably more accurate. We have made an extensive comparison with other
similar studies and traced the reasons for the, in most cases, relatively small
differences.
  Among the results we note the following: We find [O/Fe] from the O I IR-
triplet lines to possibly increase beyond [Fe/H]=-1.0, though considerably less
than obtained by others from abundances based on OH lines. We find correlations
among the deviations for individual stars from the trends of individual alpha
elements relative to Fe. This may support the idea that the formation of the
Halo stars occurred in smaller systems with different star formation rates. We
verify the finding by Gratton et al. (2003b) that stars that do not participate
in the rotation of the galactic disk show a lower mean and larger spread in
[alpha/Fe] than stars participating in the general rotation. The latter stars
also seem to show some correlation between [alpha/Fe] and rotation speed. We
finally advocate that a spectroscopic study of a larger sample of halo stars
with well-defined selection criteria is very important, in addition to the very
considerable efforts that various groups have already made. (Abridged)",2005-05-06T10:46:35Z
"Discovery of a Fifth Image of the Large Separation Gravitationally
  Lensed Quasar SDSS J1004+4112","We report the discovery of a fifth image in the large separation lensed
quasar system SDSS J1004+4112. A faint point source located 0.2'' from the
center of the brightest galaxy in the lensing cluster is detected in images
taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Near Infrared Camera
and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. The flux
ratio between the point source and the brightest lensed component in the ACS
image is similar to that in the NICMOS image. The location and brightness of
the point source are consistent with lens model predictions for a lensed image.
We therefore conclude that the point source is likely to be a fifth image of
the source quasar. In addition, the NICMOS image reveals the lensed host galaxy
of the source quasar, which can strongly constrain the structure of the lensing
critical curves and thereby the mass distribution of the lensing cluster.",2005-03-15T09:48:33Z
Reversals of radio emission direction in PSR B1822-09,"The pulse profile of pulsar B1822-09 exhibits a very peculiar kind of mode
changing: a ""precursor"" appearing just in front of the Main-Pulse (MP) exhibits
periods of nulling, during which an interpulse (IP) becomes detectable at
rotation phase separated by roughly 180 deg from the precursor. We propose that
this bizarre phenomenon, which requires an information transfer between the two
components, occurs by means of reversal of a direction of coherent radio
emission generated in the same emission region. This interpretation naturally
explains the lack of weak radio emission in the off-pulse regions, as well as
the problem of information transfer between emission regions associated with
the MP precursor and the IP. The reversals also imply nulling. The model has
profound physical implications: (i) the mechanism of coherent radio emission
must allow radiation into two, opposite, intermittently changing directions;
(ii) the radio waves must be able to propagate through inner regions of the
neutron star magnetosphere with strong magnetic field. Most importantly, the
model implies inward radio emission in pulsar magnetosphere.",2005-03-18T13:12:13Z
"A Chandra HETGS Spectral Study of the Iron K Bandpass in MCG-6-30-15: A
  Narrow View of the Broad Iron Line","We present a high resolution X-ray spectrum of the iron K bandpass in
MCG-6-30-15 based on a 522 ksec observation with Chandra's High Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometer. The Chandra spectrum is consistent with the
presence of a relativistically broadened, highly redshifted iron K alpha
emission line with a similar profile to previous observations. A number of
narrow features are detected above 2 keV, including a narrow Fe K alpha
emission line and narrow absorption lines from H- and He-like Fe, H-like S and
H-like Si. This absorption is well described by a photoionized plasma with a
column density log N_H = 23.2 and an ionization parameter log xi = 3.6,
assuming the iron abundance has the Solar value and a velocity dispersion
parameter b = 100 km/s. Applying this absorption model to a high fidelity
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn spectrum we find that a broad iron line is still required
with emission extending to within 1.9 gravitational radii of the black hole. If
the iron line comes from an accretion disk truncated at the innermost stable
circular orbit, this indicates that the black hole must be spinning rapidly
with a>0.95. Ionized absorption models attempting to explain the 3-6 keV
spectral curvature without strong gravity predict absorption lines in the
6.4-6.6 keV range that are inconsistent with the Chandra spectrum. The H- and
He-like iron absorption lines in the Chandra spectrum are blueshifted by 2.0
(+0.7/-0.9) x 10^3 km/s compared to the source frame, and may originate in a
high velocity, high ionization component of the warm absorber outflow. This
high ionization component may dominate the energy budget of the outflow, and
account for a significant fraction of the outflowing mass. (Abstract
truncated).",2005-06-03T16:10:13Z
Primordial Black Holes - Recent Developments,"Recent developments in the study of primordial black holes (PBHs) will be
reviewed, with particular emphasis on their formation and evaporation. PBHs
could provide a unique probe of the early Universe, gravitational collapse,
high energy physics and quantum gravity. Indeed their study may place
interesting constraints on the physics relevant to these areas even if they
never formed. In the ""early Universe"" context, particularly useful constraints
can be placed on inflationary scenarios, especially if evaporating PBHs leave
stable Planck-mass relicts. In the ""gravitational collapse"" context, the
existence of PBHs could provide a unique test of the sort of critical phenomena
discovered in recent numerical calculations. In the ""high energy physics""
context, information may come from gamma-ray bursts (if a subset of these are
generated by PBH explosions) or from cosmic rays (if some of these derive from
evaporating PBHs). In the ""quantum gravity"" context, the formation and
evaporation of small black holes could lead to observable signatures in cosmic
ray events and accelerator experiments, providing there are extra dimensions
and providing the quantum gravity scale is around a TeV.",2005-04-01T19:34:37Z
Rotation in Gravitational Lenses,"Gravitational lensing deflects light. A single lens deflector can only shear
images, but cannot induce rotations. Multiple lens planes can induce rotations.
Such rotations can be observed in quadruply imaged sources, and can be used to
distinguish between two proposed solutions of the flux anomaly problem:
substructures in lensing galaxies vs large scale structure. We predict the
expected amount of rotation due to large scale structure in strong lensing
systems, and show how this effect can be measured using ~ mas VLBI astrometry
of quadruple lenses with extended source structures. The magnitude of rotation
is around one degree. The biggest theoretical uncertainty is the power spectrum
of dark matter on very small scales. This procedure can potentially be turned
around to measure the dark matter power spectrum on very small scales. We list
the predicted RMS rotation angles for several quadruple lenses with known lens
and source redshifts.",2005-06-02T10:47:47Z
"Search for Cross-Correlations of Ultra--High-Energy Cosmic Rays with BL
  Lacertae Objects","We present the results of searches for correlation between ultra--high-energy
cosmic rays observed in stereo mode by the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes)
experiment and objects of the BL Lac subclass of active galaxies. In
particular, we discuss an excess of events correlating with confirmed BL Lacs
in the Veron 10th Catalog. As described in detail in Abbasi et al. (2005), the
significance level of these correlations cannot be reliably estimated due to
the a posteriori nature of the search, and the results must be tested
independently before any claim can be made. We identify the precise hypotheses
that will be tested with independent data.",2005-07-20T02:42:43Z
Total and Jet Blandford-Znajek Power in Presence of Accretion Disk,"A rotating black hole probably powers ultrarelativistic jets in gamma-ray
bursts, relativistic jets from some active galactic nuclei, and jets from some
black hole x-ray binaries. Prior estimates of the power output of a black hole
have assumed an infinitely thin disk, a magnetic field based upon a slowly
rotating black hole, and have not self-consistently determined the geometry or
magnitude of the magnetic field for a realistic accretion disk. We provide
useful formulae for the total and jet Blandford-Znajek (BZ) power and
efficiency as determined self-consistently from general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic numerical models. Of all jet mechanisms, we suggest that
only the BZ mechanism is able to produce an ultrarelativistic jet.",2005-06-16T17:53:25Z
Angular power spectrum of the FastICA CMB component from BEAST data,"We present the angular power spectrum of the CMB component extracted with
FastICA from the Background Emission Anisotropy Scanning Telescope (BEAST)
data. BEAST is a 2.2 meter off-axis telescope with a focal plane comprising 8
elements at Q (38-45 GHz) and Ka (26-36 GHz) bands. It operates from the UC
White Mountain Research Station at an altitude of 3800 meters. The BEAST CMB
angular power spectrum has been already calculated by O'Dwyer et.al. using only
the Q band data. With two input channels FastICA returns two possible
independent components. We found that one of these two has an unphysical
spectral behaviour while the other is a reasonable CMB component. After a
detailed calibration procedure based on Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations we
extracted the angular power spectrum for the identified CMB component and found
a very good agreement with the already published BEAST CMB angular power
spectrum and with the WMAP data.",2005-07-12T16:32:13Z
"Stellar Lyman-alpha Emission Lines in the Hubble Space Telescope
  Archive: Intrinsic Line Fluxes and Absorption from the Heliosphere and
  Astrospheres","We search the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive for previously unanalyzed
observations of stellar H I Lyman-alpha emission lines, our primary purpose
being to look for new detections of Lyman-alpha absorption from the outer
heliosphere, and to also search for analogous absorption from the astrospheres
surrounding the observed stars. The astrospheric absorption is of particular
interest because it can be used to study solar-like stellar winds that are
otherwise undetectable. We find and analyze 33 HST Lyman-alpha spectra in the
archive. All the spectra were taken with the E140M grating of the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board HST. The HST/STIS
spectra yield 4 new detections of heliospheric absorption (70 Oph, Xi Boo, 61
Vir, and HD 165185) and 7 new detections of astrospheric absorption (EV Lac, 70
Oph, Xi Boo, 61 Vir, Delta Eri, HD 128987, and DK UMa), doubling the previous
number of heliospheric and astrospheric detections. When combined with previous
results, 10 of 17 lines of sight within 10 pc yield detections of astrospheric
absorption. This high detection fraction implies that most of the ISM within 10
pc must be at least partially neutral, since the presence of H I within the ISM
surrounding the observed star is necessary for an astrospheric detection. In
contrast, the detection percentage is only 9.7% (3 out of 31) for stars beyond
10 pc. Our Lyman-alpha analyses provide measurements of ISM H I and D I column
densities for all 33 lines of sight, and we discuss some implications of these
results. Finally, we measure chromospheric Lyman-alpha fluxes from the observed
stars. We use these fluxes to determine how Lyman-alpha flux correlates with
coronal X-ray and chromospheric Mg II emission, and we also study how
Lyman-alpha emission depends on stellar rotation.",2005-03-16T21:20:08Z
"Correlation between radio luminosity and X-ray timing frequencies in
  neutron star and black hole X-ray binaries","We report on correlations between radio luminosity and X-ray timing features
in X-ray binary systems containing low magnetic field neutron stars and black
holes. The sample of neutron star systems consists of 4U 1728-34, 4U 1820-34,
Ser X-1, MXB 1730-335, GX 13+1, the millisecond X-ray pulsars SAX J1808.4-3658
and IGR J00291+5934, and these are compared with the black hole system GX
339-4. The analysis has been done using data from pointed observations of the
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer coordinated with radio observations. In the neutron
star systems the radio luminosity L_{R} is correlated with the characteristic
frequency of the L_{h} Lorentzian component detected contemporaneously in the
power spectrum, and anticorrelated with its strength. Similarly, in the black
hole system GX 339-4 L_{R} is correlated with the frequency of the L_{\ell}
component in the power spectrum, and anti-correlated with its strength. The
index of a power-law fit to the correlation is similar in both cases, L_{R}
\propto \nu^{~1.4} and L_{R} \propto (rms)^{-2.3}. At lower timing frequencies,
the radio luminosity is further found to be correlated with the characteristic
(break) frequency of the L_{b} component of the power spectra in the neutron
stars and, marginally, with the equivalent break frequency in GX 339-4. We
briefly discuss the coupling between the innermost regions of the accretion
disc and the production of the jet and, from the behaviour of the ms accreting
X-ray pulsars, the possible role of the NS magnetic field.",2005-07-11T16:53:50Z
Search for Cosmic-Ray Antideuterons,"We performed a search for cosmic-ray antideuterons using data collected
during four BESS balloon flights from 1997 to 2000. No candidate was found. We
derived, for the first time, an upper limit of 1.9E-4 (m^2 s sr
GeV/nucleon)^(-1) for the differential flux of cosmic-ray antideuterons, at the
95% confidence level, between 0.17 and 1.15 GeV/nucleon at the top of the
atmosphere.",2005-04-16T03:58:52Z
The Galaxy in the cosmological context,"A new view on our Galaxy has recently emerged, with large consequences on its
formation scenarios. Not only new dwarf satellites have been detected, still
orbiting and tidally disrupting, but also a multitude of stellar streams or
tidal debris have been observed suggesting the formation of the halo through
successive accretions. The large scatter in the age-metallicity relation in the
solar neighborhood points towards several accretion episodes, while the
chemical evolution of the disk requires a more or less continuous gas infall.
The global kinematics and morphology refined by large surveys such as 2MASS
suggest the existence of two embedded bars, as is frequently observed in
external galaxies. The mass of the central black hole has been refined through
stellar proper motions, and is compatible with the M$_{bh}$-$\sigma$ relation
valid for all bulges. The baryonic dark matter is no longer thought to lie in
compact objects, and on the contrary, more dark cold gas is revealed by
gamma-ray observations. The star forming history can be built, and confronted
to numerical models of galaxy evolution both through hierarchical and secular
scenarios. Our Galaxy plays thus the role of a prototype to probe galaxy
formation theories, and in particular thin and thick disk formation.",2005-07-12T11:11:17Z
"Precision measurement of cosmic magnification from 21 cm emitting
  galaxies","We show how precision lensing measurements can be obtained through the
lensing magnification effect in high redshift 21cm emission from galaxies.
Normally, cosmic magnification measurements have been seriously complicated by
galaxy clustering. With precise redshifts obtained from 21cm emission line
wavelength, one can correlate galaxies at different source planes, or exclude
close pairs to eliminate such contaminations.
  We provide forecasts for future surveys, specifically the SKA and CLAR. SKA
can achieve percent precision on the dark matter power spectrum and the galaxy
dark matter cross correlation power spectrum, while CLAR can measure an
accurate cross correlation power spectrum. The neutral hydrogen fraction was
most likely significantly higher at high redshifts, which improves the number
of observed galaxies significantly, such that also CLAR can measure the dark
matter lensing power spectrum. SKA can also allow precise measurement of
lensing bispectrum.",2005-04-25T18:36:37Z
"Determining the Properties and Evolution of Red Galaxies from the Quasar
  Luminosity Function","(Abridged) We study the link between quasars and the red galaxy population
using a model for the self-regulated growth of supermassive black holes in
mergers involving gas-rich galaxies. Using a model for quasar lifetimes and
evolution motivated by hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers, we
de-convolve the observed quasar luminosity function at various redshifts to
determine the rate of formation of black holes of a given final mass.
Identifying quasar activity with the formation of spheroids in the framework of
the merger hypothesis, this enables us to deduce the corresponding rate of
formation of spheroids with given properties as a function of redshift. This
allows us to predict, for the red galaxy population, the distribution of galaxy
velocity dispersions, the mass function, mass density, star formation rates,
the luminosity function in many observed wavebands (NUV, U, B, V, R, I, J, H,
K), the total red galaxy number density and luminosity density, the
distribution of colors as a function of magnitude and velocity dispersion for
several different wavebands, the distribution of mass to light ratios vs. mass,
the luminosity-size relations, and the typical ages and distribution of ages
(formation redshifts) as a function of both mass and luminosity. For each of
these quantities, we predict the evolution from redshift z=0-6. Each of our
predictions agrees well with existing observations, without the addition of
tunable parameters; the essential observational inputs come from the observed
quasar luminosity function. These predictions are skewed by several orders of
magnitude if we adopt simpler, traditional models of quasar lifetimes in which
quasars turn on/off or follow simple exponential light curves, instead of the
more complicated evolution implied by our simulations.",2005-08-05T20:07:35Z
"The Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating: Design, Fabrication,
  Ground Calibration and Five Years in Flight","Details of the design, fabrication, ground and flight calibration of the High

presented after five years of flight experience. Specifics include the theory
of phased transmission gratings as applied to the HETG, the Rowland design of
the spectrometer, details of the grating fabrication techniques, and the
results of ground testing and calibration of the HETG. For nearly six years the

Brief history of the metal accumulation in the intracluster medium,"We use models of the rates of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and core-collapse
supernovae, built in such a way that both are consistent with recent
observational constraints at z<1.6 and can reproduce the measured cosmic star
formation rate, to recover the history of the metals accumulation in the
intra-cluster medium. We show that these SN rates, in unit of SN number per
comoving volume and rest-frame year, provide on average a total amount of Iron
that is marginally consistent with the value measured in galaxy clusters in the
redshift range 0-1, and a relative evolution with redshift that is in agreement
with the observational constraints up to z~1.2. Moreover, we verify that the
predicted metals to Iron ratios reproduce the measurements obtained in nearby
clusters through X-ray analysis, implying that (1) about half of the Iron mass
and >75 per cent of the Nickel mass observed locally are produced by SN Ia
ejecta, (2) the SN Ia contribution to the metal budget decreases steeply with
redshift and by z~1 is already less than half of the local amount and (3) a
transition in the abundance ratios relative to the Iron is present between
redshifts ~0.5 and 1.4, with core-collapse SN products becoming dominant at
higher redshifts.",2005-06-13T14:31:24Z
Measurement of core-shifts with astrometric multi-frequency calibration,"VLBI is unique, among the space geodetic techniques, in its contribution to
defining and maintaining the International Celestial Reference Frame, providing
precise measurements of coordinates of extragalactic radiosources. The quest
for increasing accuracy of VLBI geodetic products has lead to a deeper revision
of all aspects that might introduce errors in the analysis. The departure of
the observed sources from perfect, stable, compact and achromatic celestial
targets falls within this category. This paper is concerned with the impact of
unaccounted frequency-dependent position shifts of source cores in the analysis
of dual-band S/X VLBI geodesy observations, and proposes a new method to
measure them. The multi-frequency phase transfer technique developed and
demonstrated by Middelberg et al. (2005) increases the high frequency coherence
times of VLBI observations, using the observations at a lower frequency. Our
proposed SOURCE/FREQUENCY PHASE REFERENCING method endows it with astrometric
applications by adding a strategy to estimate the ionospheric contributions.
Here we report on the first successful application to measure the core shift of
the quasar 1038+528 A at S and X-bands, and validate the results by comparison
with those from standard phase referencing techniques. In this particular case,
and in general in the cm-wavelength regime, both methods are equivalent.
Moreover the proposed method opens a new horizon with targets and fields
suitable for high precision astrometric studies with VLBI, especially at high
frequencies where severe limitations imposed by the rapid fluctuations in the
troposphere prevent the use of standard phase referencing techniques.",2005-05-23T14:07:29Z
"Discovery of 10 micron silicate emission in quasars. Evidence of the AGN
  unification scheme","According to the unified scheme, AGN are surrounded by a dust-torus, and the
observed diversity of AGN properties results from the different orientations
relative to our line of sight. The strong resonance of silicate dust at 10
micron is therefore, as expected, seen in absorption towards many type-2 AGN.
In type-1 AGN, it should be seen in emission because the hot inner surface of
the dust torus becomes visible. However, this has not been observed so far,
thus challenging the unification scheme or leading to exotic modifications of
the dust-torus model. Here we report the discovery of the 10 micron silicate
feature in emission in two luminous quasars with the Infrared Spectrograph of
the Spitzer Space Telescope.",2005-04-12T08:12:47Z
"The origin of HE0107-5240 and the production of O and Na in extremely
  metal-poor stars","We elaborate the binary scenario for the origin of HE0107-5240, the most
metal-poor star yet observed ([Fe/H] = -5.3), using current knowledge of the
evolution of extremely metal-poor stars. From the observed C/N value, we
estimate the binary separation and period. Nucleosynthesis in a helium
convective zone into which hydrogen has been injected allows us to discuss the
origin of surface O and Na as well as the abundance distribution of s-process
elements. We can explain the observed abundances of 12C, 13C, N, O, and Na and
predict future observations to validate the Pop III nature of HE0107-5240.",2005-04-25T15:27:42Z
"Submillimetre photometry of X-ray absorbed QSOs: their formation and
  evolutionary status","We present an analysis of the submillimetre/X-ray properties of 19 X-ray
absorbed, Compton-thin quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) selected to have
luminosities and redshifts which represent the peak of cosmic QSO activity.
i.e. ~L* objects at 1<z<3. Of these, we present new data for 11 objects not
previously observed at submillimetre wavelengths and additional data for a
further 3. The detection rate is 42 per cent, much higher than typically
reported for samples of QSOs. Detection statistics show (at the 3-4 sigma
level) that this sample of absorbed QSOs has a higher submillimetre output than
a matched sample of unabsorbed QSOs. We argue that the far-infrared luminosity
is produced by massive star formation. In this case, the correlation found
between far-infrared luminosity and redshift can be interpreted as cosmological
evolution of the star-formation rate in the QSO host galaxies. Since the
submillimetre luminous phase is confined to z>1.5, the high star formation
rates are consistent with a scenario in which the QSOs evolve to become local
luminous elliptical galaxies.
  Combining these results with previously published data for X-ray unabsorbed
QSOs and submillimetre-selected galaxies we propose the following evolutionary
sequence: the forming galaxy is initially far-infrared luminous but X-ray weak
similar to the sources discovered by the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer
Array; as the black hole and spheroid grow with time a point is reached when
the central QSO becomes powerful enough to terminate the star formation and
eject the bulk of the fuel supply (the Compton-thin absorbed QSO phase); this
transition is followed by a period of unobscured QSO activity which
subsequently declines to leave a quiescent spheroidal galaxy.",2005-03-29T12:22:22Z
The Masses of the Orion Proplyds from Submillimeter Dust Emission,"We have imaged the 880 micron continuum emission from the ""proplyds"" in the
center of the Trapezium Cluster in Orion using the Submillimeter Array with a
beam size 1.5'' FWHM and an rms of 2.7 mJy. Five sources are detected with
fluxes in the range 18 to 38 mJy, which includes dust emission from four
proplyds and ionized gas from theta1 Ori G. The total masses of the detected
proplyds derived from their dust emission range from 0.013 to 0.024 Msun
assuming a dust temperature of 20 K and mass opacity of 0.03 cm^2/g. The
eighteen other proplyds within the field-of-view were not formally detected
individually, but by combining the fluxes measured at their locations, an
average flux of 1.1mJy was determined for them on a statistical basis,
corresponding to a mass of 8e-4 Msun. The four detected proplyds have
sufficient disk mass bound to their central stars to form planetary systems on
the scale of our Solar System.",2005-06-10T03:45:17Z
"To see or not to see a Bow Shock: Identifying Bow Shocks with H-Alpha
  Allsky Surveys","OB-stars have the highest luminosities and strongest stellar winds of all
stars, which enables them to interact strongly with their surrounding ISM, thus
creating bow shocks. These offer us an ideal opportunity to learn more about
the ISM. They were first detected and analysed around runaway OB-stars using
the IRAS allsky survey by van Buren et al. (1995). Using the geometry of such
bow shocks information concerning the ISM density and its fluctuations can be
gained from such infrared observations. As to help to improve the bow shock
models, additional observations at other wavelengths, e.g. H-Alpha, are most
welcome. However due to their low velocity these bow shocks have a size of ~1
degrees, and could only be observed as a whole with great difficulties. In the
light of the new H-Alpha allsky surveys (SHASSA/VTSS) this is no problem any
more. We developed different methods to detect bow shocks, e.g. the improved
determination of their symmetry axis with radial distance profiles. Using two
H-Alpha-allsky surveys (SHASSA/VTSS), we searched for bow shocks and compared
the different methods. From our sample we conclude, that the correlation
between the direction of both proper motion and the symmetry axis determined
with radial distance profile is the most promising detection method. We found
eight bow shocks around HD 17505, HD 24430, HD 48099, HD 57061, HD 92206, HD
135240, HD 149757, and HD 158186 from 37 candidates taken from van Buren et al.
(1995). Additionally to the traditional determination of ISM parameters using
the standoff distance of the bow shock, another approach was chosen, using the
thickness of the bow-shock layer. Both methods lead to the same results,
yielding densities (~1 cm^{-3}) and the maximal temperatures (~10^4 K), that
fit well to the up-to-date picture of the Warm Ionised Medium.",2005-05-05T14:05:46Z
"H-alpha Imaging of Early-type (Sa-Sab) Spiral Galaxies II. Global
  Properties","New results, based on one of the most comprehensive H-alpha imaging surveys
of nearby Sa-Sab spirals completed to date, reveals early-type spirals to be a
diverse group of galaxies that span a wide range in massive star formation
rates. While the majority of Sa-Sab galaxies in our sample are forming stars at
a modest rate, a significant fraction (~29%) exhibit star formation rates
greater than 1 M(solar/yr), rivaling the most prolifically star forming
late-type spirals. A similar diversity is apparent in the star formation
history of Sa-Sab spirals as measured by their H-alpha equivalent widths.
Consistent with our preliminary results presented in the first paper in this
series, we find giant HII regions (L(H-alpha)>10^{39}erg/s) in the disks of 37%
of early-type spirals. We suspect that recent minor mergers or past
interactions are responsible for the elevated levels of H-alpha emission and
perhaps, for the presence of giant HII regions in these galaxies.",2005-06-02T20:55:41Z
A variability study of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6300 with XMM-Newton,"We present the results of timing analysis of the XMM-Newton observation of
the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6300. The hard X-ray spectrum above 2 keV consists of
a Compton-thin-absorbed power law, as is often seen in Seyfert 2 galaxies. We
clearly detected rapid time variability on a time scale of about 1000 s from
the light curve above 2 keV. The excess variance of the time variability
(sigma2_RMS) is calculated to be ~0.12, and the periodogram of the light curve
is well represented by a power law function with a slope of 1.75. In contrast
with previous results from Seyfert 2 nuclei, these variability characteristics
are consistent with those of Seyfert 1 galaxies. This consistency suggests that
NGC 6300 has a similar black hole mass and accretion properties as Seyfert 1
galaxies. Using the relation between time variability and central black hole
mass by Hayashida et al. (1998), the black hole mass of NGC 6300 is estimated
to be ~2.8x10^5 Mo. Taking uncertainty of this method into account, the black
hole mass is less than 10^7 Mo. Taking the bolometric luminosity of 3.3x10^43
erg/s into consideration, this yields an accretion rate of > 0.03 of the
Eddington value, and comparable with estimates from Seyfert 1 galaxies using
this method. The time variability analysis suggests that NGC 6300 actually has
a Seyfert 1 nucleus obscured by a thick matter, and more generally provides a
new pillar of support for the unified model of Seyfert galaxies based on
obscuration.",2005-07-20T07:12:31Z
"Optical Spectroscopy of the Surface Population of the rho Ophiuchi
  Molecular Cloud: The First Wave of Star Formation","We present the results of optical spectroscopy of 139 stars obtained with the
Hydra multi-object spectrograph. The objects extend over a 1.3 square degree
area surrounding the main cloud of the rho Oph complex. The objects were
selected from narrowband images to have H alpha in emission. Using the presence
of strong H alpha emission, lithium absorption, location in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, or previously reported x-ray emission, we were
able to identify 88 objects as young stars associated with the cloud. Strong H
alpha emission was confirmed in 39 objects with line widths consistent with
their origin in magnetospheric accretion columns. Two of the strongest
emission-line objects are young, x-ray emitting brown dwarf candidates with M8
spectral types. Comparisons of the bolometric luminosities and effective
temperatures with theoretical models suggest a medianage for this population of
2.1 Myr which is signifcantly older than the ages derived for objects in the
cloud core. It appears that these stars formed contemporaneously with low mass
stars in the Upper Scorpius subgroup, likely triggered by massive stars in the
Upper-Centaurus subgroup.",2005-06-10T22:01:57Z
The cooling of shock-compressed primordial gas,"We find that at redshifts z > 10, HD line cooling allows strongly-shocked
primordial gas to cool to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). This temperature is the minimum value attainable via radiative cooling.
Provided that the abundance of HD, normalized to the total number density,
exceeds a critical level of ~ 10^{-8}, the CMB temperature floor is reached in
a time which is short compared to the Hubble time. We estimate the
characteristic masses of stars formed out of shocked primordial gas in the wake
of the first supernovae, and resulting from the mergers of dark matter haloes
during hierarchical structure formation to be ~ 10 M_{solar}. In addition, we
show that cooling by HD enables the primordial gas in relic H II regions to
cool to temperatures considerably lower than those reached via H_2 cooling
alone. We confirm that HD cooling is unimportant in cases where the primordial
gas does not go through an ionized phase, as in the formation process of the
very first stars in z ~ 20 minihaloes of mass ~ 10^{6} M_{solar}.",2005-05-14T00:24:33Z

"Measuring the halo mass of MgII absorbers from their cross-correlation
  with Luminous Red Galaxies","We study the cross-correlation between 716 MgII quasar absorption systems and
about 100,000 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 3 in the redshift range 0.4<z<0.8. The MgII systems were
selected to have 2796 & 2803 rest-frame equivalent widths greater than 1.0 \AA
and identifications confirmed by the FeII 2600 or MgI 2852 lines. Over
co-moving scales 0.2--13/h Mpc, the MgII--LRG cross-correlation has an
amplitude 0.69+/-0.09 times that of the LRG--LRG auto-correlation. Since LRGs
have halo-masses of 10^{13} \msun, this strong cross-correlation implies that
the absorber host-galaxies have halo-masses 1--2 times 10^{12} \msun.",2005-04-19T14:56:22Z
"Searching for merger debris in the Galactic halo: Chemodynamical
  evidence based on local blue HB stars","We report on the discovery of a group of local A-type blue horizontal-branch
(HBA) stars moving in a prograde, comet-like orbit with very similar kinematics
and abundances. This serendipitously discovered group contains 5 or 6 local HBA
stars venturing very close to the Galactic centre; their [Fe/H] is around -1.7,
and they seem to present minimum scatter in at least Mg, Si, Ti, Fe, Al, and Cr
abundances. This ``Cometary Orbit Group'' (COG) was found while we were testing
a new method to detect the debris associated with the merger of smaller,
specific protogalactic entities into our galaxy. The method is primarily
intended to identify field HBA stars with similar kinematics and detailed,
multi-species abundance patterns as seen among members of a surviving remnant
(e.g., omega Centauri). Quite possibly, the COG is the remnant, on a highly
decayed orbit, of a merging event that took place in the relatively remote past
(i.e., at least one revolution ago).",2005-07-02T00:36:34Z
"FIRST-based survey of Compact Steep Spectrum sources, II. MERLIN and VLA
  observations of Medium-sized Symmetric Objects","A new sample of candidate Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources that are much
weaker than the CSS source prototypes has been selected from the VLA FIRST
catalogue. MERLIN `snapshot' observations of the sources at 5 GHz indicate that
six of them have an FR II-like morphology, but are not edge-brightened as is
normal for Medium-sized Symmetric Objects (MSOs) and FR IIs. Further
observations of these six sources with the VLA at 4.9 GHz and MERLIN at 1.7
GHz, as well as subsequent full-track observations with MERLIN at 5 GHz of what
appeared to be the two sources of greatest interest are presented. The results
are discussed with reference to the established evolutionary model of CSS
sources being young but in which not all of them evolve to become old objects
with extended radio structures. A lack of stable fuelling in some of them may
result in an early transition to a so-called coasting phase so that they fade
away instead of growing to become large-scale objects. It is possible that one
of the six sources (1542+323) could be labelled as a prematurely `dying' MSO or
a `fader'.",2005-05-20T11:33:57Z
X-ray obscuration and obscured AGN in the local universe,"In this paper we discuss the X-ray properties of 49 local (z<0.035) Seyfert 2
galaxies with HST/WFC2 high-resolution optical coverage. It includes the
results of 26 still unpublished Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, which
yield 25 (22) new X-ray detections in the 0.5-2 keV (2-10 keV) energy band. Our
sample covers a range in the 2-10 keV observed flux from 3x10^{-11} to
6x10^{-15} erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The percentage of the objects which are
likely obscured by Compton-thick matter (column density, N_H>1.6x10^{24}
atoms/cm/cm) is ~50%, and reaches ~80% for log(F_{2-10})<12.3. Hence, K-alpha
fluorescent iron lines with large Equivalent Width (EW > 0.6 keV) are common in
our sample (6 new detections at a confidence level >2 sigma). They are
explained as due to reflection off the illuminated side of optically thick
material. We confirm a correlation between the presence of a ~100-pc scale
nuclear dust in the WFC2 images and Compton-thin obscuration. We interpret this
correlation as due to the large covering fraction of gas associated with the
dust lanes following an idea originally proposed by Malkan et al. 1998, and
Matt 2000). The X-ray spectra of highly obscured AGN invariably present a
prominent soft excess emission above the extrapolation of the hard X-ray
component. This soft component can account for a very large fraction of the
overall X-ray energy budget. As this component is generally unobscured - and
therefore likely produced in extended gas structures - it may lead to a severe
underestimation of the nuclear obscuration in z~1 absorbed AGN, if standard
X-ray colors are used to classify them. As a by-product of our study, we report
the discovery of a soft X-ray, luminous (~7x10^{40} erg/s) halo embedding the
interacting galaxy pair Mkn266.",2005-08-11T16:37:28Z
Dynamics of the Solar Magnetic Network: Two-dimensional MHD Simulations,"The aim of this work is to identify the physical processes that occur in the
network and contribute to its dynamics and heating. We model the network as
consisting of individual flux tubes with a non-potential field structure that
are located in intergranular lanes. With a typical horizontal size of 200 km at
the base of the photosphere, they expand upward and merge with their neighbors
at a height of about 600 km. Above a height of approximately 1000 km the
magnetic field starts to become uniform.
  Waves are generated in this medium by means of motions at the lower boundary.
We focus on transverse driving, which generates both fast and slow waves within
a flux tube and acoustic waves at the interface of the tube and the field-free
medium. The acoustic waves at the interface are due to compression of the gas
on one side of the flux tube and expansion on the other. These waves travel
upward along the two sides of the (2D) flux tube and enter it, where they
become longitudinal waves. For impulsive excitation with a time constant of 120
s, we find that a dominant feature is the creation of vortical motions that
propagate upward. We have identified an efficient mechanism for the generation
of longitudinal waves and shock formation in the chromospheric part of the flux
concentration. We examine some broad implications of our results.",2005-03-24T08:16:57Z
"Supernova Neutrino-Effects on R-Process Nucleosynthesis in Black Hole
  Formation","Stars with a wide range of masses provide a variety of production sites for
intermediate-to-heavy mass elements. Very massive stars with mass $\geq 8
M_{\odot}$ culminate their evolution by supernova explosions which are presumed
to be the most viable candidate astrophysical sites of r-process
nucleosynthesis. If the models for the supernova r-process are correct, then
nucleosynthesis results could also pose a significant constraint on the remnant
of supernova explosions, $i.e.$ neutron star or black hole. In the case of very
massive core collapse, a remnant stellar black hole is thought to be formed.
Intense neutrino flux from the neutronized core and the neutrino sphere might
suddenly cease during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase because of the black
hole formation. It is interesting to explore observable consequences of such a
neutrino flux truncation. Arguments have recently been given in the literature
that even the neutrino mass may be determined from the time delay of deformed
neutrino energy spectrum after the cease of neutrino ejection (neutrino cutoff
effect). Here, we study the expected theoretical response of the r-process
nucleosynthesis to the neutrino cutoff effect in order to look for another
independent signature of this phenomenon. We found a sensitive response of the
r-process yield if the neutrino cutoff occurs after the critical time when the
expanding materials in the neutrino-driven wind drop out of the Nuclear
Statistical Equilibrium (NSE). The r-process nucleosynthesis yields change
maximally if the cutoff occurs during the r-process. Using this result,
connected with future detection of the time-variation of SN neutrino spectrum,
we are able to identify when the black hole formation occurs in the course of
SN collapse.",2005-06-05T08:25:21Z
Intergalactic HeII absorption towards QSO 1157+3143,"We report the discovery of a further line of sight allowing detection of HeII
Ly alpha absorption by the intergalactic medium. A HST/STIS survey of 32 bright
z ~ 3 quasars selected from the Hamburg Quasar Surveys yielded one detection
toward QSO 1157+3143 (z ~ 3, B ~ 17). A 10 orbit follow-up spectrum reveals a
UV spectrum significantly supressed by two intervening Lyman limit systems at
z=2.77 and 2.94, but with the continuum flux recovering sufficiently shortward
of ~ 1700 A to allow study of the HeII absorption spectrum in the redshift
range 2.75 < z < 2.97. The absorption is characterized by alternating voids and
dense filament structures seen in both HeII and HI. Attempts to model the HeII
opacity in terms of HI Ly alpha forest absorption are not successful in the
voids, suggesting that HeII reionization is not complete between z=2.77 and
2.97 or that an optically thin Lyman limit system with z ~ 0.3 is responsible
for the additional opacity.",2005-07-07T16:21:31Z

"A first look with Chandra at SGR 1806-20 after the Giant Flare:
  significant spectral softening and rapid flux decay","We report on the results of a ~30 ks Chandra pointing of the soft gamma-ray
repeater SGR 1806-20, the first X-ray observation with high spectral resolution
performed after the 2004 December 27 Giant Flare. The source was found in a
bursting active phase and with a significantly softer spectrum than that of the
latest observations before the Giant Flare. The observed flux in the 2-10 keV
range was ~2.2 x10^-11 erg/s/cm^2, about 20% lower than that measured three
months before the event. This indicates that, although its giant flare was ~100
times more intense than those previously observed in two other soft gamma-ray
repeaters, the post flare X-ray flux decay of SGR 1806-20 has been much faster.
The pulsed fraction was about 3%, a smaller value than that observed before the
flare. We discuss the different properties of the post-flare evolution of SGR
1806-20 in comparison to those of SGR 1900+14 and interpret the results as a
strong evidence that a magnetospheric untwisting occurred (or is occurring)
after the Giant Flare.",2005-05-10T14:33:32Z

This formalism is applied to Bianchi I models with magnetic field. We obtain
several exact solutions of the non-minimal system including those which
describe an isotropization process. We show that there are inflationary
solutions in which the cosmological constant is determined by the non-minimal
coupling parameters. Furthermore, we find an isotropic de Sitter solution
characterized by a ""screening"" of the magnetic field as a consequence of the
non-minimal coupling.",2005-04-10T10:34:43Z
"The effect of MHD turbulence on massive protoplanetary disk
  fragmentation","Massive disk fragmentation has been suggested to be one of the mechanisms
leading to the formation of giant planets. While it has been heavily studied in
quiescent hydrodynamic disks, the effect of MHD turbulence arising from the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) has never been investigated. This paper
fills this gap and presents 3D numerical simulations of the evolution of
locally isothermal, massive and magnetized disks. In the absence of magnetic
fields, a laminar disk fragments and clumps are formed due to the effect of
self--gravity. Although they disapear in less than a dynamical timescale in the
simulations because of the limited numerical resolution, various diagnostics
suggest that they should survive and form giant planets in real disks. When the
disk is magnetized, it becomes turbulent at the same time as gravitational
instabilities develop. At intermediate resolution, no fragmentation is observed
in these turbulent models, while a large number of fragments appear in the
equivalent hydrodynamical runs. This is because MHD turbulence reduces the
strength of the gravitational instability. As the resolution is increased, the
most unstable wavelengths of the MRI are better resolved and small scale
angular momentum transport starts to play a role: fragments are found to form
in massive and turbulent disks in that case. All of these results indicate that
there is a complicated interaction between gravitational instabilities and MHD
turbulence that influences disk fragmentation processes.",2005-06-09T20:00:34Z
Discovery of fourteen new ZZ Cetis with SOAR,"We report the discovery of fourteen new ZZ Cetis with the 4.1m Southern
Astrophysical Research telescope, at Cerro Pachon, in Chile. The candidates
were selected from the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) DA white dwarf stars
with Teff obtained from the optical spectra fit, inside the ZZ Ceti instability
strip. Considering these stars are multi-periodic pulsators and the pulsations
propagate to the nucleus of the star, they carry information on the structure
of the star and evolution of the progenitors. The ZZ Cetis discovered till 2003
are mainly within 100 pc from the Sun, and probe only the solar vicinity. The
recently discovered ones, and those reported here, may sample a distinct

Where Are The M Dwarf Disks Older Than 10 Million Years?,"We present 11.7-micron observations of nine late-type dwarfs obtained at the
Keck I 10-meter telescope in December 2002 and April 2003. Our targets were
selected for their youth or apparent IRAS 12-micron excess. For all nine
sources, excess infrared emission is not detected. We find that stellar wind
drag can dominate the circumstellar grain removal and plausibly explain the
dearth of M Dwarf systems older than 10 Myr with currently detected infrared
excesses. We predict M dwarfs possess fractional infrared excess on the order
of L_{IR}/L_{*}\sim10^{-6} and this may be detectable with future efforts.",2005-06-07T07:23:20Z
"Self-Sustained Ionization and Vanishing Dead Zones in Protoplanetary
  Disks","We analyze the ionization state of the magnetohydrodynamically turbulent
protoplanetary disks and propose a new mechanism of sustaining ionization.
First, we show that in the quasi-steady state of turbulence driven by
magnetorotational instability in a typical protoplanetary disk with dust
grains, the amount of energy dissipation should be sufficient for providing the
ionization energy that is required for activating magnetorotational
instability. Second, we show that in the disk with dust grains the energetic
electrons that compose electric currents in weakly ionized gas can provide
collisional ionization, depending on the actual saturation state of
magnetorotational turbulence. On the other hand, we show that in the
protoplanetary disks with the reduced effect of dust grains, the turbulent
motion can homogenize the ionization degree, leading to the activation of
magnetorotational instability even in the absence of other ionization
processes. The results in this Letter indicate that most of the regions in
protoplanetary disks remain magnetically active, and we thus require a change
in the theoretical modeling of planet formation.",2005-06-07T03:49:45Z
"2D Simulations of the Line-Driven Instability in Hot-Star Winds: II.
  Approximations for the 2D Radiation Force","We present initial attempts to include the multi-dimensional nature of
radiation transport in hydrodynamical simulations of the small-scale structure
that arises from the line-driven instability in hot-star winds. Compared to
previous 1D or 2D models that assume a purely radial radiation force, we seek
additionally to treat the lateral momentum and transport of diffuse
line-radiation, initially here within a 2D context. A key incentive is to study
the damping effect of the associated diffuse line-drag on the dynamical
properties of the flow, focusing particularly on whether this might prevent
lateral break-up of shell structures at scales near the lateral Sobolev angle
of ca. $1^{\rm o}$. We first explore nonlinear simulations that cast the
lateral diffuse force in the simple, local form of a parallel viscosity.
Second, to account for the lateral mixing of radiation associated with the
radial driving, we next explore models in which the radial force is azimuthally
smoothed over a chosen scale. Third, to account for both the lateral line-drag
and the lateral mixing in a more self-consistent way, we explore further a
method first proposed by Owocki (1999), which uses a restricted 3-ray approach
that combines a radial ray with two oblique rays set to have an impact
parameter $p < R_{\ast}$ within the stellar core. From numerical simulations,
we find that, compared to equivalent 1-ray simulations, the high-resolution
3-ray models show systematically a much higher lateral coherence.... (Full

"Precision measurement of cosmic magnification from 21 cm emitting
  galaxies","We show how precision lensing measurements can be obtained through the
lensing magnification effect in high redshift 21cm emission from galaxies.
Normally, cosmic magnification measurements have been seriously complicated by
galaxy clustering. With precise redshifts obtained from 21cm emission line
wavelength, one can correlate galaxies at different source planes, or exclude
close pairs to eliminate such contaminations.
  We provide forecasts for future surveys, specifically the SKA and CLAR. SKA
can achieve percent precision on the dark matter power spectrum and the galaxy
dark matter cross correlation power spectrum, while CLAR can measure an
accurate cross correlation power spectrum. The neutral hydrogen fraction was
most likely significantly higher at high redshifts, which improves the number
of observed galaxies significantly, such that also CLAR can measure the dark
matter lensing power spectrum. SKA can also allow precise measurement of

Very High Energy Cosmic Rays and Their Interactions,"The investigation of high energy cosmic rays and their interactions is a very

last years as reflected by the contributions to the XIII International
Symposium on Very High Energy Cosmic Ray Interactions held in Pylos, Greece.",2005-04-15T18:24:57Z
Water Masers Toward Ultracompact HII Regions,"We present a survey in the 6_{16}-5_{23} rotational water transition toward
33 galactic ultracompact HII regions. Maser emission is detected toward 18 of
these sources; two are new detections. High quality spectra are provided for
all 18 sources. We discuss the detection rate of this survey and the
correlation of various maser properties with other physical parameters. In
addition, we report wide-bandwidth (316 km/s), moderate-resolution (~ 3'')
water maser observations of the HH80-81 region. We report the first detection
of water maser emission at the approximate velocity of the molecular core. This
emission is coincident with the extreme tip of the thermal jet, and
well-removed from the much stronger and well-known maser emission at the
position of VLA-3.",2005-07-01T20:07:44Z
The energetic Universe,"In this paper I review the main topics on the energetic Universe that have
been put forward as main science goals in the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 exercise.
I discuss the study of matter under extreme conditions (both under strong
gravity and at ultra-high densities), the cosmology of baryons (assembly of
ordinary matter in dark-matter dominated structures and the creation of heavy
elements) and the co-eval growth of super-massive black holes and stars in
galaxies along cosmic history. Most of these topics can be addressed with a
large-aperture deep Universe X-ray space observatory that can be flown soon
after 2015, complemented by gravitational wave observatories (LISA), a
focussing gamma-ray observatory, a far infrared high-sensitivity observatory
and an X-ray survey telescope.",2005-08-09T16:25:35Z
Variable stars in Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy,"We present the first results of a variable star search in the field and in
the globular clusters of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Variable stars
were identified using the Image Subtraction Technique (Alard 2000) on
time-series data obtained with the ESO 2.2 m and the Magellan 6.5 m telescopes.
The variable star sample includes RR Lyrae stars, Dwarf Cepheids and Anomalous
Cepheids. The pulsation properties (namely: periods, light curves,
period-amplitude relations and classification in Oosterhoff types) of Fornax
variables from the present study are discussed in some detail.",2005-07-11T09:57:37Z
Extended emission around GPS radio sources,"Extended radio emission detected around a sample of GHz Peaked Spectrum (GPS)
radio sources is discussed. Evidence for extended emission which is related to
the GPS source is found in 6 objects out of 33. Three objects are associated
with quasars with core-jet pc-scale morphology, and three are identified with
galaxies with symmetric (CSO) radio morphology. We conclude that the core-jet
GPS quasars are likely to be beamed objects with a continuous supply of energy
from the core to the kpc scale. It is also possible that low surface brightness
extended radio emission is present in other GPS quasars but the emission is
below our detection limit due to the high redshifts of the objects. On the
other hand, the CSO/galaxies with extended large scale emission may be
rejuvenated sources where the extended emission is the relic of previous
activity. In general, the presence of large scale emission associated with GPS
galaxies is uncommon, suggesting that in the context of the recurrent activity
model, the time scale between subsequent bursts is in general longer than the
radiative lifetime of the radio emission from the earlier activity.",2005-07-21T08:44:37Z
O stars with weak winds: the Galactic case,"We study the stellar and wind properties of a sample of Galactic O dwarfs to
track the conditions under which weak winds (i.e mass loss rates lower than ~
1e-8 Msol/yr) appear. The sample is composed of low and high luminosity dwarfs
including Vz stars and stars known to display qualitatively weak winds.
Atmosphere models including non-LTE treatment, spherical expansion and line
blanketing are computed with the code CMFGEN. Both UV and Ha lines are used to
derive wind properties while optical H and He lines give the stellar
parameters. Mass loss rates of all stars are found to be lower than expected
from the hydrodynamical predictions of Vink et al. (2001). For stars with log
L/Lsol > 5.2, the reduction is by less than a factor 5 and is mainly due to the
inclusion of clumping in the models. For stars with log L/Lsol < 5.2 the
reduction can be as high as a factor 100. The inclusion of X-ray emission in
models with low density is crucial to derive accurate mass loss rates from UV
lines. The modified wind momentum - luminosity relation shows a significant
change of slope around this transition luminosity. Terminal velocities of low
luminosity stars are also found to be low. The physical reason for such weak
winds is still not clear although the finding of weak winds in Galactic stars
excludes the role of a reduced metallicity. X-rays, through the change in the
ionisation structure they imply, may be at the origin of a reduction of the
radiative acceleration, leading to lower mass loss rates. A better
understanding of the origin of X-rays is of crucial importance for the study of
the physics of weak winds.",2005-07-12T10:04:43Z
Radial velocity moments of dark matter haloes,"Using cosmological N-body simulations we study the radial velocity
distribution in dark matter haloes focusing on the lowest-order even moments,
dispersion and kurtosis. We determine the properties of ten massive haloes in
the simulation box approximating their density distribution by the NFW formula
characterized by the virial mass and concentration. We also calculate the
velocity anisotropy parameter of the haloes and find it mildly radial and
increasing with distance from the halo centre. The radial velocity dispersion
of the haloes shows a characteristic profile with a maximum, while the radial
kurtosis profile decreases with distance starting from a value close to
Gaussian near the centre. We therefore confirm that dark matter haloes possess
intrinsically non-Gaussian, flat-topped velocity distributions. We find that
the radial velocity moments of the simulated haloes are quite well reproduced
by the solutions of the Jeans equations obtained for the halo parameters with
the anisotropy measured in the simulations. We also study the radial velocity
moments for a composite cluster made of ten haloes out to ten virial radii. In
this region the velocity dispersion decreases systematically to reach the value
of the background, while kurtosis increases from below to above the Gaussian
value of 3 signifying a transition from a flat-topped to a strongly peaked
velocity distribution with respect to the Gaussian, which can be interpreted as
the dominance of ordered flow with a small dispersion. We illustrate the
transition by showing explicitly the velocity distribution of the composite
cluster in a few radial bins.",2005-03-17T14:43:15Z
"Self-similar solutions for relativistic shocks emerging from stars with
  polytropic envelopes","We consider a strong ultrarelativistic shock moving through a star whose
envelope has a polytrope-like density profile. When the shock is close to the
star's outer boundary, its behavior follows the self-similar solution given by
Sari (2005) for implosions in planar geometry. Here we outline this solution
and find the asymptotic solution as the shock reaches the star's edge. We then
show that the motion after the shock breaks out of the star is described by a
self-similar solution remarkably like the solution for the motion inside the
star. In particular, the characteristic Lorentz factor, pressure, and density
vary with time according to the same power laws both before and after the shock
breaks out of the star. After emergence from the star, however, the
self-similar solution's characteristic position corresponds to a point behind
the leading edge of the flow rather than at the shock front, and the relevant
range of values for the similarity variable changes. Our numerical integrations
agree well with the analytic results both before and after the shock reaches
the star's edge.",2005-05-09T20:47:34Z
"Detection of a classical Delta Scuti star in the new eclipsing binary
  system HIP 7666","HIP 7666 is a variable star newly discovered during the Hipparcos mission and
classified as of unknown type (ESA 1997). During 23 nights between July 2000
and November 2000, over 2300 CCD observations in the V band were obtained from
Hostalets de Pierola and Monegrillo observatories in Spain. These data show
that the new variable is a detached eclipsing binary system with an orbital
period of 2.37229 days. In addition, one of the components undergoes very
short-period oscillations with a main pulsation frequency of 24.46 or 25.47
c/d. HIP 7666 is therefore a new member of the presently very few known
detached eclipsing binary systems with a Delta Scuti type component.",2005-05-17T09:14:32Z
"An Active Instance-based Machine Learning method for Stellar Population
  Studies","We have developed a method for fast and accurate stellar population
parameters determination in order to apply it to high resolution galaxy
spectra. The method is based on an optimization technique that combines active
learning with an instance-based machine learning algorithm. We tested the
method with the retrieval of the star-formation history and dust content in
""synthetic"" galaxies with a wide range of S/N ratios. The ""synthetic"" galaxies
where constructed using two different grids of high resolution theoretical
population synthesis models. The results of our controlled experiment shows
that our method can estimate with good speed and accuracy the parameters of the
stellar populations that make up the galaxy even for very low S/N input. For a
spectrum with S/N=5 the typical average deviation between the input and fitted
spectrum is less than 10**{-5}. Additional improvements are achieved using
prior knowledge.",2005-07-22T01:05:49Z
A Puzzling Merger in A3266: the Hydrodynamic Picture from XMM-Newton,"Using the mosaic of nine XMM-Newton observations, we study the hydrodynamic
state of the merging cluster of galaxies Abell 3266. The high quality of the
spectroscopic data and large field of view of XMM-Netwon allow us to determine
the thermodynamic conditions of the intracluster medium on scales of order of
50 kpc. A high quality entropy map reveals the presence of an extended region
of low entropy gas, running from the primary cluster core toward the northeast
along the nominal merger axis. The mass of the low entropy gas amounts to
approximately 2e13 solar masses, which is comparable to the baryonic mass of
the core of a rich cluster. We test the possibility that the origin of the
observed low entropy gas is either related to the disruption a preexisting
cooling core in Abell 3266 or to the stripping of gas from an infalling
subcluster companion. We find that both the radial pressure and entropy
profiles as well as the iron abundance of Abell 3266 do not resemble those in
other known cooling core clusters (Abell 478). Thus we conclude that the low
entropy region is subcluster gas in the process of being stripped off from its
dark matter halo. In this scenario the subcluster would be falling onto the
core of A3266 from the foreground. This would also help interpret the observed
high velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the cluster center, provided that
the mass of the subcluster is at most a tenth of the mass of the main cluster.",2005-05-02T20:02:42Z
Options for a nondedicated mission to test the Pioneer anomaly,"The Doppler-tracking data of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft show an
unmodelled constant acceleration in the direction of the inner Solar System.
Serious efforts have been undertaken to find a conventional explanation for
this effect, all without success at the time of writing. Hence the effect,
commonly dubbed the Pioneer anomaly, is attracting considerable attention.
Unfortunately, no other space mission has reached the long-term navigation
accuracy to yield an independent test of the effect. To fill this gap we
discuss strategies for an experimental verification of the anomaly via an
upcoming space mission. Emphasis is put on two plausible scenarios:
nondedicated concepts employing either a planetary exploration mission to the
outer Solar System or a piggybacked micro-spacecraft to be launched from a
mother spacecraft travelling to Saturn or Jupiter. The study analyses the
impact of a Pioneer anomaly test on the system and trajectory design for these
two paradigms. It is found that both paradigms are capable of verifying the
Pioneer anomaly and determine its magnitude at 10% level. Moreover the concepts
can discriminate between the most plausible classes of models of the anomaly, a
central force, a blueshift of the radio signal and a drag-like force. The
necessary adaptions of the system and mission design do not impair the
planetary exploration goals of the missions.",2005-04-28T15:19:02Z
Direct detection of the inflationary gravitational wave background,"Inflation generically predicts a stochastic background of gravitational waves
over a broad range of frequencies, from those accessible with cosmic microwave
background (CMB) measurements, to those accessible directly with
gravitational-wave detectors, like NASA's Big-Bang Observer (BBO) or Japan's
Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observer (DECIGO), both currently
under study. Here we investigate the detectability of the inflationary
gravitational-wave background at BBO/DECIGO frequencies. To do so, we survey a
range of slow-roll inflationary models consistent with constraints from the CMB
and large-scale structure (LSS). We go beyond the usual assumption of power-law
power spectra, which may break down given the 16 orders of magnitude in
frequency between the CMB and direct detection, and solve instead the
inflationary dynamics for four classes of inflaton potentials. Direct detection
is possible in a variety of inflationary models, although probably not in any
in which the gravitational-wave signal does not appear in the CMB polarization.
However, direct detection by BBO/DECIGO can help discriminate between
inflationary models that have the same slow-roll parameters at CMB/LSS scales.",2005-06-17T20:00:06Z
"Are radio galaxies and quiescent galaxies different? Results from the
  analysis of HST brightness profiles","We present a study of the optical brightness profiles of early type galaxies,
using a number of samples of radio galaxies and optically selected elliptical
galaxies. For the radio galaxy samples--B2 of Fanaroff-Riley type I and 3C of
Fanaroff-Riley type II-- we determined a number of parameters that describe a
""Nuker-law"" profile, which were compared with those already known for the
optically selected objects. We find that radio active galaxies are always of
the ""core"" type (i.e. an inner Nuker law slope gamma < 0.3). However, there are
core-type galaxies which harbor no significant radio source and which are
indistinguishable from the radio active galaxies. We do not find any radio
detected galaxy with a power law profile (gamma > 0.5). This difference is not
due to any effect with absolute magnitude, since in a region of overlap in
magnitude the dichotomy between radio active and radio quiescent galaxies
remains. We speculate that core-type objects represent the galaxies that have
been, are, or may become, radio active at some stage in their lives; active and
non-active core-type galaxies are therefore identical in all respects except
their eventual radio-activity: on HST scales we do not find any relationship
between boxiness and radio-activity. There is a fundamental plane, defined by
the parameters of the core (break radius r_b and break brightness mu_b), which
is seen in the strong correlation between r_b and mu_b. The break radius is
also linearly proportional to the optical Luminosity in the $I$ band. Moreover,
for the few galaxies with an independently measured black hole mass, the break
radius turns out to be tightly correlated with M_{BH}. The black hole mass
correlates even better with the combination of fundamental plane parameters r_b
and mu_b, which represents the central velocity dispersion.",2005-05-18T09:01:44Z
Effect of Photometric Redshift Uncertainties on Weak Lensing Tomography,"We perform a systematic analysis of the effects of photometric redshift
uncertainties on weak lensing tomography. We describe the photo-z distribution
with a bias and Gaussian scatter that are allowed to vary arbitrarily between
intervals of dz = 0.1 in redshift.While the mere presence of bias and scatter
does not substantially degrade dark energy information, uncertainties in both
parameters do. For a fiducial next-generation survey each would need to be
known to better than about 0.003-0.01 in redshift for each interval in order to
lead to less than a factor of 1.5 increase in the dark energy parameter errors.
The more stringent requirement corresponds to a larger dark energy parameter
space, when redshift variation in the equation of state of dark energy is
allowed.Of order 10^4-10^5 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts fairly sampled
from the source galaxy distribution will be needed to achieve this level of
calibration. If the sample is composed of multiple galaxy types, a fair sample
would be required for each. These requirements increase in stringency for more
ambitious surveys; we quantify such scalings with a convenient fitting formula.
No single aspect of a photometrically binned selection of galaxies such as
their mean or median suffices, indicating that dark energy parameter
determinations are sensitive to the shape and nature of outliers in the photo-z
redshift distribution.",2005-06-24T21:52:09Z
"The masses, radii and luminosities of the components of U Geminorum","We present a phase-resolved spectroscopic study of the secondary star in the
cataclysmic variable U Gem. We use our data to measure the radial velocity
semi-amplitude, systemic velocity and rotational velocity of the secondary
star. Combining this with literature data allows us to determine masses and
radii for both the secondary star and white dwarf which are independent of any
assumptions about their structure. We use these to compare their properties
with those of field stars and find that both components follow field
mass-radius relationships. The secondary star has the mass, radius, luminosity
and photometric temperature of an M2 star, but a spectroscopic temperature of
M4. The latter may well be due to a high metallicity. There is a troubling
inconsistency between the radius of the white dwarf inferred from its
gravitational redshift and inclination and that inferred from its temperature,
flux, and astrometric distance.
  We find that there are two fundamental limits to the accuracy of the
parameters we can derive. First the radial velocity curve of the secondary star
deviates from a sinusoid, in part because of its asphericity (which can be
modelled) and in part because the line flux is not evenly distributed over its
surface. Second we cannot be certain which spectral type is the best match for
the lines of the secondary star, and the derived rotational velocity is a
function of the spectral type of the template star used.",2005-06-15T17:14:30Z
The Arches Cluster - Evidence for a Truncated Mass Function?,"We have analyzed high-resolution, adaptive optics (AO) HK observations of the
Arches cluster obtained with NAOS/CONICA. With a spatial resolution of 84 mas,
the cluster center is uniquely resolved. From these data the present-day mass
function (MF) of Arches is derived down to about 4 Msun. The integrated MF as
well as the core and 2nd annulus MFs are consistent with a turn-over at 6-7
Msun. This turn-over indicates severe depletion of intermediate and low-mass
stars in the Arches cluster, possibly caused by its evolution in the Galactic
Center environment. The Arches MF represents the first resolved observation of
a starburst cluster exhibiting a low-mass truncated MF. This finding has severe
implications for stellar population synthesis modelling of extragalactic
starbursts, the derivation of integrated properties such as the total mass of
star clusters in dense environments, the survival of low-mass remnants from
starburst populations, and chemical enrichment during starburst phases.",2005-06-23T20:58:00Z
"Evidence for Granulation and Oscillations in Procyon from Photometry
  with the WIRE satellite","We report evidence for the granulation signal in the star Procyon A, based on
two photometric time series from the star tracker on the WIRE satellite. The
power spectra show evidence of excess power around 1 milliHz, consistent with
the detection of p-modes reported from radial velocity measurements. We see a
significant increase in the noise level below 3 milliHz, which we interpret as
the granulation signal. We have made a large set of numerical simulations to
constrain the amplitude and timescale of the granulation signal and the
amplitude of the oscillations. We find that the timescale for granulation is
T(gran) = 750(200) s, the granulation amplitude is 1.8(0.3) times solar, and
the amplitude of the p-modes is 8(3) ppm. We found the distribution of peak
heights in the observed power spectra to be consistent with that expected from
p-mode oscillations. However, the quality of the data is not sufficient to
measure the large separation or detect a comb-like structure, as seen in the
p-modes of the Sun. Comparison with the recent negative result from the MOST
satellite reveal that the MOST data must have an additional noise source that
prevented the detection of oscillations.",2005-04-21T13:54:58Z

"Systematic Errors in Future Weak Lensing Surveys: Requirements and
  Prospects for Self-Calibration","We study the impact of systematic errors on planned weak lensing surveys and
compute the requirements on their contributions so that they are not a dominant
source of the cosmological parameter error budget. The generic types of error
we consider are multiplicative and additive errors in measurements of shear, as
well as photometric redshift errors. In general, more powerful surveys have
stronger systematic requirements. For example, for a SNAP-type survey the
multiplicative error in shear needs to be smaller than 1%(fsky/0.025)^{-1/2} of
the mean shear in any given redshift bin, while the centroids of photometric
redshift bins need to be known to better than 0.003(fsky/0.025)^{-1/2}. With
about a factor of two degradation in cosmological parameter errors, future
surveys can enter a self-calibration regime, where the mean systematic biases
are self-consistently determined from the survey and only higher-order moments
of the systematics contribute. Interestingly, once the power spectrum
measurements are combined with the bispectrum, the self-calibration regime in
the variation of the equation of state of dark energy w_a is attained with only
a 20-30% error degradation.",2005-06-02T14:25:00Z
"Binary Encounters With Supermassive Black Holes: Zero-Eccentricity LISA
  Events","Current simulations of the rate at which stellar-mass compact objects merge
with supermassive black holes (called extreme mass ratio inspirals, or EMRIs)
focus on two-body capture by emission of gravitational radiation. The
gravitational wave signal of such events will likely involve a significant
eccentricity in the sensitivity range of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA). We show that tidal separation of stellar-mass compact object binaries
by supermassive black holes will instead produce events whose eccentricity is
nearly zero in the LISA band. Compared to two-body capture events, tidal
separations have a high cross section and result in orbits that have a large
pericenter and small apocenter. Therefore, the rate of interactions per binary
is high and the resulting systems are very unlikely to be perturbed by other
stars into nearly radial plunges. Depending on the fraction of compact objects
that are in binaries within a few parsecs of the center, the rate of
low-eccentricity LISA events could be comparable to or larger than the rate of
high-eccentricity events.",2005-07-06T17:35:52Z
RAPTOR observations of the early optical afterglow from GRB 050319,"The RAPid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) system at Los Alamos
National Laboratory observed GRB 050319 starting 25.4 seconds after gamma-ray
emission triggered the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on-board the Swift
satellite. Our well sampled light curve of the early optical afterglow is
composed of 32 points (derived from 70 exposures) that measure the flux decay
during the first hour after the GRB. The GRB 050319 light curve measured by
RAPTOR can be described as a relatively gradual flux decline (power-law index
alpha = -0.37) with a transition, at about 400 s after the GRB, to a faster
flux decay (alpha = -0.91). The addition of other available measurements to the
RAPTOR light curve suggests that another emission component emerged after 10^4
s. We hypothesize that the early afterglow emission is powered by extended
energy injection or delayed reverse shock emission followed by the emergence of
forward shock emission.",2005-05-16T23:06:20Z
"Constraining beta(z) and Omega_m from redshift-space distortions in z~3
  galaxy surveys","We use sample of 813 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) with 2.6<z<3.4 to perform a
detailed analysis of the redshift-space (z-space) distortions in their
clustering pattern and from them derive confidence levels in the
[Omega_m,beta(z=3)] plane. We model the z-space distortions in the shape of the
correlation function measured in orthogonal directions, xi(sigma,pi). This
modeling requires an accurate description of the real-space correlation
function to be given as an input. From the projection of xi(sigma,pi) in the
angular direction, w_p(sigma), we derive the best fitting amplitude and slope
for the LBG real-space correlation function: r_0=4.48(+0.17)(-0.18) h(-1) Mpc
and gamma=1.76(+0.08)(-0.09) (xi(r)= (r/r_0)^-gamma). A comparison between the
shape of xi(s) and w_p(sigma) suggests that xi(r) deviates from a simple
power-law model, with a break at ~9 h(-1) Mpc. This model is consistent with
the observed projected correlation function. However, due to the limited size
of the fields used, the w_p(sigma) results are limited to sigma < 10 h(-1) Mpc.
Assuming this double power-law model, and by analysing the shape distortions in
xi(sigma,pi), we find the following constraints: beta(z=3) = 0.15
(+0.20)(-0.15), Omega_m = 0.35 (+0.65)(-0.22). Combining these results with
orthogonal constraints from linear evolution of density perturbations, we find
that beta(z=3) = 0.25 (+0.05)(-0.06), Omega_m = 0.55 (+0.45)(-0.16).",2005-05-23T09:07:08Z
"On the possibility of a helium white dwarf donor in the presumed
  ultracompact binary 2S 0918-549","2S 0918-549 is a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with a low optical to X-ray
flux ratio. Probably it is an ultracompact binary with an orbital period
shorter than 60 min. Such binaries cannot harbor hydrogen rich donor stars. As
with other (sometimes confirmed) ultracompact LMXBs, 2S 0918-549 is observed to
have a high neon-to-oxygen abundance ratio (Juett et al. 2001) which has been
used to argue that the companion star is a CO or ONe white dwarf. However,
type-I X-ray bursts have been observed from several of these systems implying
the presence of hydrogen or helium on the neutron star surface. In this paper,
we argue that the companion star in 2S 0918-549 is a helium white dwarf We
first present a Type I X-ray burst from 2S 0918-549 with a long duration of 40
minutes. We show that this burst is naturally explained by accretion of pure
helium at the inferred accretion rate of ~0.01 times the Eddington accretion
rate. At higher accretion rates of ~0.1 Eddington, hydrogen is required to
explain long duration bursts. However, at low rates the long duration is due to
the large amount of helium that accumulates prior to the burst. We show that it
is possible to form a helium white dwarf donor in an ultracompact binary if
accretion starts during the first ascent of the giant branch, when the core is
made of predominantly helium. Furthermore, this scenario naturally explains the
high neon-to-oxgen ratio, without requiring a CO or ONe white dwarf companion.
The only observational aspect of 2S 0918-549 that we cannot explain is the
absence of helium lines in the optical spectrum. Model calculations of optical
accretion disk spectra need to be carried out in order to obtain limits on the
helium abundance.",2005-06-27T20:17:45Z
Optical SETI with Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes,"The idea of searching for optical signals from extraterrestrial civilizations
has become increasingly popular over the last five years, with dedicated
projects at a number of observatories. The method relies on the detection of a
brief (few ns), intense light pulse with fast photon detectors. Ground-based
gamma-ray telescopes such as the Whipple 10m, providing a large mirror area and
equipped with an array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), are ideal instruments
for this kind of observation if the background of cosmic-ray events can be
rejected. We report here on a method for searching for optical SETI pulses,
using background discrimination techniques based on the image shape.",2005-06-30T14:19:16Z
Two Body Relaxation in Simulated Cosmological Haloes,"This paper aims at quantifying discreetness effects, born of finite particle
number, on the dynamics of dark matter haloes forming in the context of
cosmological simulations. By generalising the standard calculation of two body
relaxation to the case when the size and mass distribution are variable, and
parametrising the time evolution using established empirical relations, we find
that the dynamics of a million particle halo is noise-dominated within the
inner percent of the final virial radius. Far larger particle numbers (~ 10^8)
are required for the RMS perturbations to the velocity to drop to the 10 %
level there. The radial scaling of the relaxation time is simple and strong:
t_relax ~ r^2, implying that numbers >> 10^8 are required to faithfully model
the very inner regions; artificial relaxation may thus constitute an important
factor, contributing to the contradictory claims concerning the persistence of
a power law density cusp to the very centre. The cores of substructure haloes
can be many relaxation times old. Since relaxation first causes their expansion
before recontraction occurs, it may render them either more difficult or easier
to disrupt, depending on their orbital parameters. It may thus modify the
characteristics of the subhalo distribution and effects of interactions with
the parent. We derive simple closed form formulas for the characteristic
relaxation times, as well as for the weak N-scaling reported by Diemand et al.
when the main contribution comes from relaxing subhaloes (abridged).",2005-06-25T00:22:31Z
Relic Gravitational Waves and the Evolution of the Universe,"In the inflation models, the relic gravitational waves (RGW) generated in the
inflation stage, and evolved in the Universe until now. In the different
cosmological evolution models, one can get different gravitational waves power
spectrum. In this paper, we give a simple formula to estimate this spectrum in
a general cosmological model. From this formula, one can easily find the
relation between this power spectrum and the cosmological evolution models. The
spectrum includes all the information about the evolution of the scale factor
$a$ from inflation to now.
  So RGW is a more clear fossil, which records the cosmological evolution
information, and be a useful complementarity for another fossil$-$Cosmic

The Stellar Populations of dSph Galaxies in Nearby Groups,"In this contribution initial results are presented from a program to study in
detail the stellar populations of dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in three
nearby groups. The long-term aim of the program is to assess the influence of
environment in governing the evolution of these low-luminosity systems.
Specific results described here include the detection and measurement of

and the discovery that four of the five low-luminosity early-type dwarfs in the
low density Sculptor group contain modest amounts of neutral hydrogen gas.",2005-07-07T11:41:00Z
The connection between shear and star formation in spiral galaxies,"We present a sample of 33 galaxies for which we have calculated (i) the
average rate of shear from publish rotation curves, (ii) the far-infrared
luminosity from IRAS fluxes and (iii) The K-band luminosity from 2MASS. We show
that a correlation exists between the shear rate and the ratio of the
far-infrared to K-band luminosity. This ratio is essentially a measure of the
star formation rate per unit mass, or the specific star formation rate. From
this correlation we show that a critical shear rate exists, above which star
formation would turn off in the disks of spiral galaxies. Using the correlation
between shear rate and spiral arm pitch angle, this shear rate corresponds to
the lowest pitch angles typically measured in near-infrared images of spiral
galaxies.",2005-04-25T17:40:51Z
MHD Interaction of Pulsar Wind Nebulae with SNRs and the ISM,"In the late 1960s the discovery of the Crab pulsar in its associated
supernova remnant, launched a new field in supernova remnant research: the
study of pulsar-driven or plerionic supernova remnants. In these type of
remnants, the relativistic wind emitted by the pulsar, blows a pulsar wind
nebula into the interior of its supernova remnant. Now, more then forty years
after the discovery of the Crab pulsar, there are more then fifty plerionic
supernova remnants known, due to the ever-increasing capacity of observational
facilities. I will review our current understanding of the different
evolutionary stages of a pulsar wind nebula as it is interacting with its
associated supernova remnant.Therefore I will discuss both analytical and more
recent numerical (M)HD models.The four main stages of a pulsar wind nebula are:
the supersonic expansion stage, the reverse shock interaction stage, the
subsonic expansion stage and ultimatelythe stage when the head of the bubble is
bounded by a bow shock, due to the supersonic motion of the pulsar. Ultimately
this pulsar wind nebula bow shock will break through its associated remnant,
after which the pulsar-powered bow shock will interact directly with the
interstellar medium. I will discuss recent numerical models from these type of
pulsar wind nebulae and their morphology.",2005-04-12T15:36:11Z
"Chemical Composition in the Globular Cluster M71 from Keck/HIRES Spectra
  of Turn-Off Stars","We have made observations with the Keck I telescope and HIRES at a resolution
of $\sim$45,000 of five nearly identical stars at the turn-off of the
metal-rich globular cluster M 71. Our mean Fe abundance, [Fe/H]=-0.80 +-0.02,
is in excellent agreement with previous cluster determinations from both giants
and near-turnoff stars. There is no clear evidence for any star-to-star
abundance differences or correlations in our sample. Abundance ratios of the
Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni) are similar to Fe. The turn-off stars in M71 have
remarkably consistent enhancements of 0.2 - 0.3 dex in [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe] and
[Ti/Fe] -- like the red giants. Our [Mg/Fe] ratio is somewhat lower than that
suggested by other studies. We compare our mean abundances for the five M 71
stars with field stars of similar [Fe/H] -- 8 with halo kinematics and 17 with
disk kinematics. The abundances of the alpha-fusion products (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti)
agree with both samples, but seem a closer match to the disk stars. The Mg
abundance in M71 is at the lower edge of the disk and halo samples. The
neutron-capture elements, Y and Ba, are enhanced relative to solar in the M71
turn-off stars. Our ratio [Ba/Fe] is similar to that of the halo field stars
but a factor of two above that for the disk field stars. The important [Ba/Y]
ratio is significantly lower than M71 giant values. The Na content of the M71
turn-off stars is remarkably similar to that in the disk field stars, but more
than a factor of two higher than the halo field star sample. We find [Na/Fe] =
+0.14 $\pm$0.04 with a spread less than half of that found in the red giants in
M71. Excluding Mg, the lack of intracluster $\alpha$-element variations
(turn-off vs giants) suggests the polluting material arose in a more
traditional $s$-process environment such as AGB stars.",2005-05-06T22:09:51Z
"Hard X-ray and Gamma-ray Emission Induced by Ultra-High Energy Protons
  in Cluster Accretion Shocks","All sufficiently massive clusters of galaxies are expected to be surrounded
by strong accretion shocks, where protons can be accelerated to $\sim
10^{18}$-$10^{19}$ eV under plausible conditions. Such protons interact with
the cosmic microwave background and efficiently produce very high energy
electron-positron pairs, which then radiate synchrotron and inverse Compton
emission, peaking respectively at hard X-ray and TeV gamma-ray energies.
Characterized by hard spectra (photon indices $\sim 1.5$) and spatial
distribution tracing the accretion shock, these can dominate over other
nonthermal components depending on the shock magnetic field. HESS and other
Cerenkov telescopes may detect the TeV emission from nearby clusters,
notwithstanding its extended nature. The hard X-rays may be observable by
future imaging facilities such as NeXT, and possibly also by ASTRO-E2/HXD. Such
detections will not only provide a clear signature of ultra-high energy proton
acceleration, but also an important probe of the accretion shock itself as well
as magnetic fields in the outermost regions of clusters.",2005-05-19T09:43:04Z
"Spectral lags and the energy dependence of pulse width in gamma-ray
  bursts: contributions from the relativistic curvature effect","We compute the temporal profiles of the gamma-ray burst pulse in the four
Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) Large Area Detector (LAD)
discriminator energy channels, with the relativistic curvature effect of a
expanding fireball being explicitly investigated. Assuming an intrinsic 'Band'
shape spectrum and an intrinsic energy-independent emission profile, we show
that merely the curvature effect can produce detectable spectral lags if the
intrinsic pulse profile has a gradually decaying phase. We examine the spectral
lag's dependences on some physical parameters, such as the Lorentz factor
\Gamma, the low-energy spectral index, \alpha, of the intrinsic spectrum, the
duration of the intrinsic radiation t_d' and the fireball radius R. It is shown
that approximately the lag \propto \Gamma ^{-1} and \propto t_d', and a
spectrum with a more extruded shape (a larger \alpha) causes a larger lag. We
find no dependence of the lag on R. Quantitatively, the lags produced from the
curvature effect are marginally close to the observed ones, while larger lags
require extreme physical parameter values, e.g., \Gamma < 50, or \alpha > -0.5.
The curvature effect causes an energy-dependent pulse width distribution but
the energy dependence of the pulse width we obtained is much weaker than the
observed W \propto E^{-0.4} one. This indicates that some intrinsic
mechanism(s), other than the curvature effect, dominates the pulse narrowing of
GRBs.",2005-05-13T09:01:49Z
"The composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma of comet
  Hale-Bopp","We discuss the composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma of
comet Hale-Bopp. We do this by fitting simultaneously the infrared emission
spectrum measured by the infrared space observatory (ISO) and the measured
degree of linear polarization of scattered light at various phase angles and 12
different wavelengths. The effects of particle shape on the modeled optical
properties of the dust grains are taken into account. We constrain our fit by
forcing the abundances of the major rock forming chemical elements to be solar.
The infrared spectrum at long wavelengths reveals that large grains are needed
in order to fit the spectral slope. The size and shape distribution we employ
allows us to estimate the sizes of the crystalline silicates. The ratios of the
strength of various forsterite features show that the crystalline silicate
grains in Hale-Bopp must be submicron sized. We exclude the presence of large
crystalline silicate grains in the coma. Because of this lack of large
crystalline grains combined with the fact that we do need large amorphous
grains to fit the emission spectrum at long wavelengths, we need only
approximately 4% of crystalline silicates by mass. After correcting for
possible hidden crystalline material included in large amorphous grains, our
best estimate of the total mass fraction of crystalline material is
approximately 7.5%, significantly lower than deduced in previous studies in
which the typical derived crystallinity is 20-30%. The implications of this on
the possible origin and evolution of the comet are discussed. The crystallinity
we observe in Hale-Bopp is consistent with the production of crystalline
silicates in the inner solar system by thermal annealing and subsequent radial
mixing to the comet forming region.",2005-05-30T16:26:58Z
"The dynamical influence of cooling in the envelope of prestellar and
  protostellar cores","We compute numerical simulations of spherical collapse triggered by a slow
increase in external pressure. We compare isothermal models to models including
cooling with a simple but self-consistent treatment of the coupling between
gas, grains and radiation field temperatures. The hydrostatic equilibrium
appears to hold past the marginally stable state, until the collapse proceeds.
The last hydrostatic state before collapse has a lower central gas temperature
in the centre due to the enhanced coupling between gas, grains and radiation
field. This results in slightly lower pressure gradients in the bulk of the
envelope which is hence slightly more extended than in the isothermal case. Due
to the sensitivity of the collapse on these initial conditions, protostellar
infall velocities in the envelope turn out to be much slower in the case with
cooling.Our models also compute the radiative transfer and a rather large
chemical network coupled to gas dynamics. However, we note that the
steady-state chemisorption of CO is sufficient to provide an accurate cooling
function of the gas. This justifies the use of post-processing techniques to
account for the abundance of observed molecules. Existing observations of
infall signatures put very stringent constraints on the kinematics and
temperature profile of the class 0 protostar IRAM 04191+1522. We show that
isothermal models fail to account for the innermost slow infall motions
observed, even with the most hydrostatic initial conditions. In contrast,
models with cooling reproduce the general shape of the temperature profile
inferred from observations and are in much better agreement with the infall
signatures in the inner 3000 AU.",2005-08-05T16:22:53Z
CLASS B0631+519: Last of the CLASS lenses,"We report the discovery of a new gravitational lens system from the CLASS
survey, CLASS B0631+519. VLA, MERLIN and VLBA observations show a doubly-imaged
radio core, a doubly-imaged lobe and a second lobe that is probably
quadruply-imaged. The maximum image separation is 1.16 arcseconds. The VLBA
resolves the most magnified image of the flat-spectrum radio core into a number
of sub-components spread across approximately 20 milli-arcseconds. Optical and
near-infrared imaging with the ACS and NICMOS cameras on the HST show that
there are two galaxies along the line of sight to the lensed source, as was
previously discovered by optical spectroscopy. The nearer galaxy at z=0.0896 is
a small blue irregular, while the more distant galaxy at z=0.6196 is an
elliptical type and appears to contribute most of the lensing effect. The host
galaxy of the lensed source is visible in NICMOS imaging as a set of arcs that
form an almost complete Einstein ring. Mass modelling using non-parametric
techniques can reproduce the ring and indicates that the irregular galaxy has a
(localised) effect on the flux density distribution in the Einstein ring at the
5-10% level.",2005-05-05T17:30:01Z
Relic Gravitational Waves and the Evolution of the Universe,"In the inflation models, the relic gravitational waves (RGW) generated in the
inflation stage, and evolved in the Universe until now. In the different
cosmological evolution models, one can get different gravitational waves power
spectrum. In this paper, we give a simple formula to estimate this spectrum in
a general cosmological model. From this formula, one can easily find the
relation between this power spectrum and the cosmological evolution models. The
spectrum includes all the information about the evolution of the scale factor
$a$ from inflation to now.
  So RGW is a more clear fossil, which records the cosmological evolution
information, and be a useful complementarity for another fossil$-$Cosmic
  Microwave Background Radiation (CMB).",2005-05-30T04:29:13Z
"The Core-Collapse Supernova with ""Non-Uniform"" Magnetic Fields","We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations on the core-collapse of a
massive star with strong magnetic fields and differential rotations using a
numerical code ZEUS-2D. Changing field configurations and laws of differential
rotation parametrically, we compute 14 models and investigate effects of these
parameters on the dynamics. In our models, we do not solve the neutrino
transport and instead employ a phenomenological parametric EOS that takes into
account the neutrino emissions. As a result of the calculations, we find that
the field configuration plays a significant role in the dynamics of the core if
the initial magnetic field is large enough. Models with initially concentrated
fields produce more energetic explosions and more prolate shock waves than the
uniform field. Quadrapole-like fields produce remarkably collimated and fast
jet, which might be important for gamma-ray bursts(GRB). The Lorentz forces
exerted in the region where the plasma-beta is less than unity are responsible
for these dynamics. The pure toroidal field, on the other hand, does not lead
to any explosion or matter ejection. This suggests the presupernova models of
Heger et al.(2003), in which toroidal fields are predominant, is
disadvantageous for the magnetorotation-induced supernova considered here.
Models with initially weak magnetic fields do not lead to explosion or matter
ejection, either. In these models magnetic fields play no role as they do not
grow on the timescale considered in this paper so that the magnetic pressure
could be comparable to the matter pressure. This is because the exponential
field growth as expected in MRI is not seen in our models. The magnetic field
is amplified mainly by field-compression and field-wrapping in our simulations.",2005-05-31T16:46:56Z
"Spectroscopic study of the long-period dust-producing WC7pd+O9 binary
  HD192641","We present the results of an optical spectroscopic study of the massive
Wolf-Rayet binary WR137. These data cover the dust-formation maximum in 1997.
Combining all available measurements of radial velocities, we derive, for the
first time, a spectroscopic orbit with period 13.05 +/- 0.18 years. The
resulting masses, adopting i=67degrees, are M(O)= 20 +/- 2 Mo and M(WR)= 4.4+/-
1.5 Mo. These appear, respectively, around normal and on the low side for the
given spectral types. Analysis of the intense multi-site spectroscopic
monitoring in 1999 shows that the CIII5696 and CIV5802/12 lines have the
highest intrinsic variability levels. The periodogram analysis yields a
small-amplitude modulation in the absorption troughs of the CIV5802/12 and
HeI5876 lines with a period of 0.83 days, which could be related either to
pulsations or large-scale rotating structures as seen in the WN4 star EZ Canis
Majoris (WR6).Wavelet analysis of the strong emission lines of CIII5696 and
CIV5802/12 enabled us to isolate and follow for several hours small structures
associated with density enhancements within the wind of the Wolf-Rayet star.
Cross-correlating the variability patterns seen in different lines, we find a
weak but significant correlation between the varability in emission lines with
different ionization potential, i.e. in lines formed at different distances
from the WR stellar core. Adopting a beta wind-velocity law, from the motion of
individual subpeaks we find beta around 5, which is significantly larger than
the canonical value of 1 usually found in O-star winds.",2005-04-21T16:33:23Z
"Boundary Effective Field Theory and Trans-Planckian Perturbations:
  Astrophysical Implications","We contrast two approaches to calculating trans-Planckian corrections to the
inflationary perturbation spectrum: the New Physics Hypersurface [NPH] model,
in which modes are normalized when their physical wavelength first exceeds a
critical value, and the Boundary Effective Field Theory [BEFT] approach, where
the initial conditions for all modes are set at the same time, and modified by
higher dimensional operators enumerated via an effective field theory
calculation. We show that these two approaches -- as currently implemented --
lead to radically different expectations for the trans-Planckian corrections to
the CMB and emphasize that in the BEFT formalism we expect the perturbation
spectrum to be dominated by quantum gravity corrections for all scales shorter
than some critical value. Conversely, in the NPH case the quantum effects only
dominate the longest modes that are typically much larger than the present
horizon size. Furthermore, the onset of the breakdown in the standard
inflationary perturbation calculation predicted by the BEFT formalism is likely
to be associated with a feature in the perturbation spectrum, and we discuss
the observational signatures of this feature in both CMB and large scale
structure observations. Finally, we discuss possible modifications to both
calculational frameworks that would resolve the contradictions identified here.",2005-05-20T11:57:01Z
Molecular Gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) III. The warped LINER NGC3718,"We present the first interferometric observations of CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) line
emission from the warped LINER NGC3718, obtained with the IRAM PdBI. This L1.9
galaxy has a prominent dust lane and on kpc scales, a strongly warped atomic
and molecular gas disk. The molecular gas is closely associated with the dust
lane across the nucleus and its kinematic center is consistent with the mm
continuum AGN. A comparison of our interferometric mosaic data, which fully
cover the ~9kpc warped disk, with a previously obtained IRAM 30m single dish
CO(1-0) map shows that the molecular gas distribution in the disk is heavily
resolved by the PdBI map. After applying a short-spacing correction with the
IRAM 30m data, we find in total six main source components within the dust
lane: one associated with the nucleus, four symmetrically positioned on either
side at galactocentric distances of about 1.3kpc and 4.0kpc from the center,
and a sixth on the western side at ~3kpc with only a very weak eastern
counterpart. In the framework of a kinematic model using tilted rings, we
interpret the five symmetric source components as locations of strong orbital
crowding. We further find indications that the warp appears not only on kpc
scales, but continues down to 250pc. Besides the sixth feature on the western
side, the lower flux of the eastern components compared to the western ones
indicates an intrinsic large scale asymmetry in NGC3718 that cannot be
explained by the warp. Indications for a small scale asymmetry are also seen in
the central 600pc. These asymmetries might be evidence for a tidal interaction
with a companion galaxy (large scales) and gas accretion onto the nucleus
(small scales). Our study of NGC3718 is part of the NUGA project that aims at
investigating the different processes of gas accretion onto AGN.",2005-07-18T10:50:10Z
The Unusual Luminosity Function of the Globular Cluster M10,"We present the I-band luminosity function of the differentially reddened
globular cluster M10. We combine photometric analysis derived from wide-field
(23' x 23') images that include the outer regions of the cluster and
high-resolution images of the cluster core. After making corrections for
incompleteness and field star contamination, we find that the relative numbers
of stars on the lower giant branch and near the main-sequence turnoff are in
good agreement with theoretical predictions. However, we detect significant (>
6 \sigma) excesses of red giant branch stars above and below the red giant
branch bump using a new statistic (a population ratio) for testing relative
evolutionary timescales of main-sequence and red giant stars. The statistic is
insensitive to assumed cluster chemical composition, age, and main-sequence
mass function. The excess number of red giants cannot be explained by
reasonable systematic errors in our assumed cluster chemical composition, age,
or main-sequence mass function. Moreover, M10 shows excesses when compared to
the cluster M12, which has nearly identical metallicity, age, and
color-magnitude diagram morphology. We discuss possible reasons for this
anomaly, finding that the most likely cause is a mass function slope that shows
significant variations as a function of mass.",2005-04-08T23:51:17Z
The heavy elements mixture and the stellar cluster age,"Recent analyses of solar spectroscopic data (see Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval
2004 and references therein) suggest a significative variation of the heavy
elements abundance. The change of heavy mixture might affect the determination
of the clusters age for two different reasons: the change of theoretical
isochrones at fixed metallicity and the variation of the inferred cluster
metallicity from the observed [Fe/H]. The first point is analyzed discussing
the effects of updating the metal distribution on theoretical evolutionary
tracks and isochrones for metallicities suitable for the galactic globular and
open clusters and for the bulk population of the Large Magellanic Clouds. The
maximum variation of the estimated age ($\approx$0.5 Gyr), although not
negligible, is still within the present uncertainty. The second point is
addressed by comparing present theoretical predictions with the very precise
observational data of the Hyades cluster from the Hypparcos satellite.",2005-04-27T18:40:15Z
"Color Gradients in Early-type Galaxies: Dependence on Environment and
  Redshift","Color gradients in early-type galaxies contain valuable clues about their
formation and evolutionary histories and mechanisms. We examine color gradients
in 1,700 early-type galaxies in 159 galaxy clusters spanning a redshift range
of 0.05 to 0.2. We find that color gradients strongly depend on the environment
where galaxies reside, with steeper color gradients in poor rather than rich
clusters. No dependence of color gradients on galaxy luminosity is found in
either rich or poor clusters. The difference in color gradients can be
explained by a change in the internal metallicity and/or an age gradient in
these galaxies. Our results support a reasonable picture whereby young
early-type galaxies form in a dissipative collapse process, and then undergo
increased (either major or minor) merging activity in richer rather than in
poor clusters.",2005-04-28T09:27:20Z
TeV Dark Matter detection by Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes,"Ground based Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes have recently unveiled a TeV
gamma-ray signal from the direction of the Galactic Centre. We examine whether
these gamma-rays, observed by the VERITAS, CANGAROO-II and HESS collaborations,
may arise from annihilations of dark matter particles. Emission from nearby
dwarf spheroidals, such as Sagittarius, could provide a test of this scenario.",2005-05-19T17:00:02Z
"FUSE observations of molecular hydrogen on the line of sight towards
  HD141569A","We present an analysis of the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)
spectrum of HD141569A, a transitional object known to possess a circumstellar
disk. We observe two components of gas at widely different temperatures along
the line of sight. We detect cold H2, which is thermalized up to J=2 at a
kinetic temperature of 51K. Such low temperatures are typical of the diffuse
interstellar medium. Since the line of sight to HD141569A does not pass through
its disk, it appears that we are observing the cold H2 in a low extinction
envelope associated with the high Galactic latitude dark cloud complex L134N,
which is in the same direction and at nearly the same distance as HD141569A.
The column densities of the higher J-levels of H2 suggest the presence of warm
gas along the line of sight. The excitation conditions do not seem to be
consistent with what is generally observed in diffuse interstellar clouds. The
observed radial velocity of the gas implies that the UV spectral lines we
observe are likely interstellar in origin rather than circumstellar, although
our absorption line study does not definitely rule out the possibility that the
warm gas is close to the star. The discovery of such warm gas along the line of
sight may provide evidence for turbulent phenomena in the dark cloud L134N.",2005-06-13T15:34:39Z
Three-dimensional stability of the solar tachocline,"The three-dimensional, hydrodynamic stability of the solar tachocline is
investigated based on a rotation profile as a function of both latitude and
radius. By varying the amplitude of the latitudinal differential rotation, we
find linear stability limits at various Reynolds numbers by numerical
computations. We repeated the computations with different latitudinal and
radial dependences of the angular velocity. The stability limits are all higher
than those previously found from two-dimensional approximations and higher than
the shear expected in the Sun. It is concluded that any part of the tachocline
which is radiative is hydrodynamically stable against small perturbations.",2005-06-13T12:28:19Z
"Collapse and Fragmentation of Rotating Magnetized Clouds. II. Binary
  Formation and Fragmentation of First Cores","Subsequent to Paper I, the evolution and fragmentation of a rotating
magnetized cloud are studied with use of three-dimensional MHD nested-grid
simulations. After the isothermal runaway collapse, an adiabatic gas forms a
protostellar first core at the center of the cloud. When the isothermal gas is
stable for fragmentation in a contracting disk, the adiabatic core often breaks
into several fragments. Conditions for fragmentation and binary formation are
studied. All the cores which show fragmentations are geometrically thin, as the
diameter-to-thickness ratio is larger than 3. Two patterns of fragmentation are
found. (1) When a thin disk is supported by centrifugal force, the disk
fragments through a ring configuration (ring fragmentation). This is realized
in a fast rotating adiabatic core as Omega >0.2 tau_ff^-1, where Omega and
tau_ff represent the angular rotation speed and the free-fall time of the core,
respectively. (2) On the other hand, the disk is deformed to an elongated bar
in the isothermal stage for a strongly magnetized or rapidly rotating cloud.
The bar breaks into 2 - 4 fragments (bar fragmentation). Even if a disk is
thin, the disk dominated by the magnetic force or thermal pressure is stable
and forms a single compact body. In either ring or bar fragmentation mode, the
fragments contract and a pair of outflows are ejected from the vicinities of
the compact cores. The orbital angular momentum is larger than the spin angular
momentum in the ring fragmentation. On the other hand, fragments often quickly
merge in the bar fragmentation, since the orbital angular momentum is smaller
than the spin angular momentum in this case. Comparison with observations is
also shown.",2005-06-19T09:27:08Z
"Constraints from Galaxy-AGN Clustering on the Correlation between Galaxy
  and Black Hole Mass at Redshifts 2<Z<3","We use the clustering of galaxies around distant active-galactic nuclei to
derive an estimate of the relationship between galaxy and black hole mass that
obtained during the ancient quasar epoch, at redshifts 2 <~ z <~ 3, when giant
black holes accreted much of their mass. Neither the mean relationship nor its
scatter differs significantly from what is observed in the local universe, at
least over the ranges of apparent magnitude (16 <~ G_AB <~ 26) and black-hole
mass (10^6 <~ M_BH/M_sun <~ 10^10.5) that we are able to probe.",2005-05-26T22:46:45Z
"The ACS Virgo Cluster Survey V: SBF Calibration for Giant and Dwarf
  Early-type Galaxies","As part of the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS) Virgo Cluster Survey, we have
measured Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) in a sample of 100 early-type
Virgo galaxies. Distances derived from these measurements are needed to explore
the three-dimensional structure of the Virgo Cluster, study the intrinsic
parameters of globular clusters associated with the program galaxies, and
compare with the galaxy distances derived from globular cluster luminosity
functions. Our SBF measurements have been performed in the F850LP bandpass of
the Wide Field Channel of the ACS on the Hubble Space Telescope. These are the
first measurements of this kind, and we present the first SBF calibration for
this bandpass. The measured fluctuations depend on galaxy stellar population
variations, which we quantify by galaxy color (g_475-z_850)_0, where g_475 and
z_850 are the galaxy magnitudes, respectively, in the F475W and F850LP ACS
filters. We derive the following calibration for the absolute SBF magnitude
M_850: M_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (2.0 +/ 0.2) [ (g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the
range 1.3 <(g_475-z_850)_0 <= 1.6, and M_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (0.9 +/- 0.2) [
(g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the range 1.0 <=(g_475-z_850)_0 <= 1.3. Physically,
the two different color regimes correspond to different galaxy types: giant
ellipticals and S0s at the red end, and early-type dwarfs at the blue end. For
the first time in SBF studies, we are able to provide a firm empirical
calibration of SBF in early-type dwarf galaxies. Our results agree with stellar
population model predictions from Bruzual & Charlot (2003).",2005-06-14T16:20:44Z
"Tightening Constraints from the Lyman Alpha Forest with the Flux
  Probability Distribution Function","The analysis of the Lyman-alpha forest of absorption lines in quasar spectra
has emerged as a potentially powerful technique to constrain the linear matter
power spectrum. In most previous work, the amplitude of the ionizing background
was fixed by calibrating simulations to match the observed mean transmitted
flux in the Lyman-alpha forest. This procedure is undesirable in principle as
it requires the estimation of the unabsorbed quasar continuum level, a
difficult undertaking subject to various sources of systematic error and bias.
We suggest an alternative approach based on measuring the one-point probability
distribution function (pdf) of the fluctuations in the flux about the mean,
relative to the mean, i.e. the pdf of delta_f = (f - <f>)/<f>. This statistic,
while sensitive to the amplitude of the ionizing background, has the virtue
that its measurement does not require an estimate of the unabsorbed continuum
level. We present a measurement of the pdf of delta_f from seven Keck HIRES
spectra, spanning a redshift range of z = 2.2 - 4.4. To illustrate that our
method is useful, we compare our measurements of the pdf of delta_f, and
measurements of the flux power spectrum from Croft et al. (2002) at z = 2.72,
with cosmological simulations. From this comparison, we obtain constraints on
the mean transmission in the Lyman-alpha forest, the slope of the
temperature-density relation, as well as the amplitude and slope of the mass
power spectrum. Our methodology will be useful for obtaining more precise
constraints with larger data samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).",2005-05-06T21:21:40Z
"Quantum corrections to the inflaton potential and the power spectra from
  superhorizon modes and trace anomalies","We obtain the effective inflaton potential during slow roll inflation by
including the one loop quantum corrections to the energy momentum tensor from
scalar curvature and tensor perturbations as well as quantum fluctuations from
light scalars and light Dirac fermions generically coupled to the inflaton.
During slow roll inflation there is a clean and unambiguous separation between
superhorizon and subhorizon contributions to the energy momentum tensor. The
superhorizon part is determined by the curvature perturbations and scalar field
fluctuations: both feature infrared enhancements as the inverse of a
combination of slow roll parameters which measure the departure from scale
invariance in each case.Fermions and gravitons do not exhibit infrared
divergences. The subhorizon part is completely specified by the trace anomaly
of the fields with different spins and is solely determined by the space-time
geometry. The one-loop quantum corrections to the amplitude of curvature and
tensor perturbations are obtained to leading order in slow-roll and in the
(H/M_PL)^2 expansion. This study provides a complete assessment of the
backreaction problem up to one loop including bosonic and fermionic degrees of
freedom. The result validates the effective field theory description of
inflation and confirms the robustness of the inflationary paradigm to quantum
fluctuations. Quantum corrections to the power spectra are expressed in terms
of the CMB observables:n_s, r and dn_s/dln k. Trace anomalies (especially the
graviton part) dominate these quantum corrections in a definite direction: they
enhance the scalar curvature fluctuations and reduce the tensor fluctuations.",2005-07-26T11:11:01Z
Evolutionary Consequences of Dusty Tori in Active Galactic Nuclei,"Deep surveys of {\em Chandra} and {\em HST} (Hubble Space Telescope) show
that active galactic nucleus (AGN) populations are changing with hard X-ray
luminosities. This arises an interesting question whether the dusty torus is
evolving with the central engines. We assemble a sample of 50 radio-quiet PG
quasars to tackle this problem. The covering factors of the dusty tori can be
estimated from the multiwavelength continuum. We find they are strongly
correlated with the hard X-ray luminosity. Interestingly this correlation
agrees with the fraction of type II AGNs discovered by {\em Chandra} and {\em
HST}, implying strong evidence for that the AGN population changing results
from the evolution of the tori. We also find that the frequencies of the dips
around 1$\mu$m in the continuum correlate with the covering factors in the
present sample, indicating the dip frequencies are adjusted by the covering
factors. In the scenario of fueling black hole from the torus, the covering
factor is a good and the dip frequency is a potential indicator of the torus
evolution.",2005-05-20T01:41:38Z
Distant red galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field,"We take advantage of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) data to study the
restframe optical and ultra violet (UV) morphologies of the novel population of
Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs). Six galaxies with J-Ks > 2.3 are found to Ks=21.5,
five of which have photometric redshifts z_phot > 2, corresponding to a surface
density of 0.9/arcmin^2. The surface brightness distributions of the z_phot > 2
galaxies are better represented by exponential disks than R^{1/4}-laws. Two of
the z_phot > 2 galaxies are extended, while three have compact morphologies.
The restframe optical morphology of the z_phot > 2 galaxies is quite different
from the restframe UV morphology: all the galaxies have red central components
which dominate in the NICMOS H_{160}-band images, and distinct off-center blue
features which show up in (and often dominate) the ACS images. The mean
measured effective radius of the z_phot > 2 galaxies is <r_e> =1.9+/-1.4 kpc,
similar (within the errors) to the mean size of LBGs at similar redshifts. All
the DRGs are resolved in the ACS images, while four are resolved in the NICMOS
images. Two of the z_phot > 2 galaxies are bright X-ray sources and hence host
AGN. The diverse restframe optical and UV morphological properties of DRGs
derived here suggest that they have complex stellar populations, consisting of
both evolved populations that dominate the mass and the restframe optical
light, and younger populations, which show up as patches of star formation in
the restframe UV light; in many ways resembling the properties of normal local
galaxies. This interpretation is supported by fits to the broadband SEDs, which
for all five z_phot > 2 are best represented by models with extended star
formation histories and substantial amounts of dust.",2005-03-21T21:08:23Z
Evolution of Low-Mass Population III Stars,"We present the evolutionary models of metal-free stars in the mass range from
0.8 to 1.2 Msun with up-to-date input physics. The evolution is followed to the
onset of hydrogen mixing into a convection, driven by the helium flash at red
giant or asymptotic giant branch phase.
  The models of mass M >= 0.9 Msun undergo the central hydrogen flash,
triggered by the carbon production due to the 3-alpha reactions.
  We find that the border of the off-center and central ignition of helium core
flash falls between 1.1 and 1.2 Msun; the models of mass M <= 1.1 Msun
experience the hydrogen mixing at the tip of red giant branch while the models
of M = 1.2 Msun during the helium shell flashes on the asymptotic giant branch.
  The equation of state for the Coulomb liquid region, where electron
conduction and radiation compete, is shown to be important since it affects the
thermal state in the helium core and influences the red giant branch evolution.
  It is also found that the non-resonant term of 3-alpha reactios plays an
important role, although it has negligible effect in the evolution of stars of
younger populations.
  We compare our models with the computations by several other sets of authors,
to confirm the good agreement except for one study which finds the helium
ignition much closer to the center with consequences important for subsequent
evolution.",2005-04-25T15:22:31Z
"The XMM Large-Scale Structure Survey: An initial sample of galaxy groups
  and clusters to a redshift z<0.6","We present X-ray and optical spectroscopic observations of twelve galaxy
groups and clusters identified within the XMM Large-Scale Structure (LSS)
survey. Groups and clusters are selected as extended X-ray sources from a 3.5
deg2 XMM image mosaic above a flux limit 8e-15 ergs/s/cm2 in the [0.5-2] keV
energy band. Deep BVRI images and multi-object spectroscopy confirm each source
as a galaxy concentration located within the redshift interval 0.29<z<0.56. We
combine line-of-sight velocity dispersions with the X-ray properties of each
structure computed from a two-dimensional surface brightness model and a single
temperature fit to the XMM spectral data. The resulting distribution of X-ray
luminosity, temperature and velocity dispersion indicate that the XMM-LSS
survey is detecting low-mass clusters and galaxy groups to redshifts z < 0.6.
Confirmed systems display little or no evidence for X-ray luminosity evolution
at a given X-ray temperature compared to lower redshift X-ray group and cluster
samples. A more complete understanding of these trends will be possible with
the compilation of a statistically complete sample of galaxy groups and
clusters anticipated within the continuing XMM-LSS survey.",2005-07-29T20:56:12Z
"Hot Stars in Old Stellar Populations: A Continuing Need for Intermediate
  Ages","We investigate the effect of a small contamination of hot, old, metal-poor
starlight on the inferred stellar populations of early-type galaxies in the
core of the Coma Cluster. We find that the required correction to the Balmer
and metal absorption-line strengths for old, metal-poor stars does not
significantly affect the inferred age of the stellar population when the Hbeta
strength is large. Intermediate-aged populations are therefore still needed to
explain enhanced Balmer-line strengths in early-type galaxies. This gives us
increased confidence in our age estimates for these objects. For galaxies with
weak Balmer-line strengths corresponding to very old populations (t>10 Gyr),
however, a correction for hot stars may indeed alter the inferred age, as
previously suggested. Finally, the inferred metallicity [Z/H] will always be
higher after any correction for old, metal-poor starlight than without, but the
enhancement ratios [E/Fe] will strengthen only slightly.",2005-06-15T08:56:06Z
Interpreting microlensing signal in QSO 2237+0305: Stars or planets?,"The multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed quasar, QSO 2237+0305, has been
the subject of recent optical monitoring campaigns, with its light curves
displaying uncorrelated variability attributed to gravitational microlensing by
masses in the foreground galaxy. Based on these light curves, it has been
claimed that the dominant microlensing population must be a population of
free-floating Jupiter-like objects; such a conclusion is not new, with several
similar claims in the literature. Historically, however, it has been shown that
such conclusions are flawed, with an incorrect interpretation of the complex
caustic network that arises at significant optical depth. This paper examines
this more recent claim, illustrating that it too is flawed.",2005-05-18T11:32:34Z
An Atlas of Spectrophotometric Landolt Standard Stars,"We present CCD observations of 102 Landolt standard stars obtained with the
R-C spectrograph on the CTIO 1.5 m telescope. Using stellar atmosphere models
we have extended the flux points to our six spectrophotometric secondary
standards, in both the blue and the red, allowing us to produce flux-calibrated
spectra that span a wavelength range from 3050 \AA to 1.1 \micron. Mean
differences between UBVRI spectrophotometry computed using Bessell's standard
passbands and Landolt's published photometry is found to be 1% or less.
Observers in both hemispheres will find these spectra useful for
flux-calibrating spectra and through the use of accurately constructed
instrumental passbands be able to compute accurate corrections to bring
instrumental magnitudes to any desired standard photometric system
(S-corrections). In addition, by combining empirical and modeled spectra of the
Sun, Sirius and Vega, we calculate and compare synthetic photometry to observed
photometry taken from the literature for these three stars.",2005-04-11T15:22:19Z
Abundances in giant stars of the globular cluster NGC 6752,"Recent theoretical yields and chemical evolution models demonstrate that
intermediate-mass AGB stars cannot reproduce the observed abundance
distributions of O, Na, Mg, and Al. As a further observational test of this
finding, we present elemental abundance ratios [X/Fe] for 20 elements in 38
bright giants of the globular cluster NGC 6752. Our mean abundance ratios
[X/Fe] are in good agreement with previous studies of this cluster and are also
consistent with other globular clusters and field stars at the same
metallicity. The mean abundance ratios [Ba/Eu] and [La/Eu] exhibit values, in
agreement with field stars at the same metallicity, that lie approximately
midway between the pure r-process and the solar (s-process + r-process) mix,
indicating that AGB stars have played a role in the chemical evolution of the
proto-cluster gas.
  For the first time, we find possible evidence for an abundance variation for
elements heavier than Al in this cluster. We find a correlation between [Si/Fe]
and [Al/Fe] which is consistent with the abundance anomalies being synthesized
via proton captures at high temperatures. Leakage from the Mg-Al chain into
28Si may explain the Si excess in stars with the highest [Al/Fe]. We identify
correlations between [Y/Fe] and [Al/Fe], [Zr/Fe] and [Al/Fe], and [Ba/Fe] and
[Al/Fe] suggesting that Y, Zr, and Ba abundances may increase by about 0.1 dex
as Al increases by about 1.3 dex. While the correlations are statistically
significant, the amplitudes of the variations are small. If the small
variations in Y, Zr, and Ba are indeed real, then the synthesis of the Al
anomalies must have taken place within an unknown class of stars that also ran
the s-process. [Abridged]",2005-04-13T14:09:24Z
"Millimeter Wave Observations of the Core-Jet and Molecular Gas in the FR
  I Radio Galaxy NGC 3801","We present BIMA 3 mm observations of the radio continuum source and the
molecular gas disk in the radio loud Fanaroff & Riley Type I (FR I)galaxy
NGC3801.We have detected a continuum source in the nucleus and determined that
it has a flat millimeter-wave spectrum, suggesting that the emission is
non-thermal and due to an AGN; the radio core is not evident in existing VLA
observations. We also map the extended 3 mm emission from the previously known
radio jets. In addition, we detect CO (1--0) emission associated with the dust
disk observed in previous HST images. A velocity gradient is observed,
indicating a two kpc radius rotating gas ring or disk oriented roughly
perpendicular to the radio jets. The inferred molecular gas mass of the disk is
$M(H_{2})=3\times10^{8}M_{\odot}$, about 1% of the dynamical mass. We also find
a $\sim 10^8$ M$_\odot$ molecular gas clump not associated with the gas disk.
There is evidence that this gas is associated with a merger and is infalling.
This suggests that FR I type activity is related to merger activity, as is
thought to be the case for FR II type radio galaxies. We also find indications
that one of the radio jets is entraining gas from the infalling molecular gas.",2005-05-13T15:07:56Z
"Inter-occurrence Times in the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld Sandpile Model: A
  Comparison with the Turbulent Statistics of Solar Flares","A sequence of bursts observed in an intermittent time series may be caused by
a single avalanche, even though these bursts appear as distinct events when
noise and/or instrument resolution impose a detection threshold. In the
Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile, the statistics of quiet times between bursts
switches from Poissonian to scale invariant on raising the threshold for
detecting instantaneous activity, since each zero-threshold avalanche breaks
into a hierarchy of correlated bursts. Calibrating the model with the time
resolution of GOES data, qualitative agreement with the inter-occurrence time
statistics of solar flares at different intensity thresholds is found.",2005-06-20T17:07:08Z
"Search for nearby stars among proper motion stars selected by
  optical-to-infrared photometry III. Spectroscopic distances of 322 NLTT stars","Distance estimates based on low-resolution spectroscopy and Two Micron All
Sky Survey (2MASS) J magnitudes are presented for a large sample of 322 nearby
candidates from Luyten's NLTT catalogue. Mainly relatively bright (typically 7
< K_s < 11) and red high proper motion stars have been selected according to
their 2MASS magnitudes and optical-to-infrared colours (+1 < R-K_s < +7). Some
LHS stars previously lacking spectroscopy have also been included. We have
classified the majority of the objects as early-M dwarfs (M2-M5). More than 70%
of our targets turned out to lie within the 25 pc horizon of the catalogue of
nearby stars, with 50 objects placed within 15 pc and 8 objects being closer
than 10 pc. Three objects in the 10 pc sample have no previously published
spectral type: LP 876-10 (M4), LP 870-65 (M4.5), and LP 869-26 (M5). A large
fraction of the objects in our sample (57%) have independent distance
estimates, mainly by the recent efforts of Reid and collaborators. Our distance
determinations are generally in good agreement with theirs. 11 rather distant
(d > 100 pc) objects have also been identified, including a probable halo, but
relatively hot (T_eff = 13000 K) white dwarf (LHS 1200) and 10 red dwarfs with
extremely large tangential velocities (250 < v_t < 1150 km/s). Altogether,
there are 11 red dwarfs (including one within 70 pc) with tangential velocities
larger than about 250 km/s. All these objects are suspected to be in fact
subdwarfs, if so, their distances would be only about half of our original
estimates. The three most extreme objects in that respect are the K and early M
dwarfs LP 323-168, LHS 5343 and LP 552-21 with corrected distances between 180
pc and 400 pc and resulting tangential velocities still larger than about 400
km/s.",2005-07-12T13:17:56Z
Exotica in rotating compact stars,"The determination of mass and radius of a single neutron star EXO 0748-676

"Observations in the 1.3 and 1.5 THz Atmospheric Windows with the
  Receiver Lab Telescope","The Receiver Lab Telescope (RLT) is a ground-based terahertz telescope; it is
currently the only instrument producing astronomical data between 1 and 2 THz.
The capabilities of the RLT have been expanding since observations began in
late 2002. Initial observations were limited to the 850 GHz and 1.03 THz
windows due to the availability of solid state local oscillators. In the last
year we have begun observations with new local oscillators for the 1.3 and 1.5
THz atmospheric windows. These oscillators provide access to the 11-10 and
13-12 lines of CO at 1.267 and 1.497 THz, as well as the [N II] line at 1.461
THz. We report on our first measurements of these high CO transitions, which
represent the highest-frequency detections ever made from the ground. We also
present initial observations of [N II] and discuss the implications of this
non-detection for the standard estimates of the strength of this line.",2005-05-12T22:52:07Z
"Membership of the Orion Nebula Population from the Chandra Orion
  Ultradeep Project","The Chandra Orion Ultradeep project (COUP) observation described in a
companion paper by Getman et al. provides an exceptionally deep X-ray survey of
the Orion Nebula Cluster and associated embedded young stellar objects.
Membership of the region is important for studies of the stellar IMF, cluster
dynamics, and star formation. The COUP study detected 1616 X-ray sources. In
this study we confirm cloud membership for 1315 stars, identify 16 probable
foreground field stars having optical counterparts with discrepant proper
motions, and classify the remaining 285 X-ray sources, of which 51 are lightly
and 234 heavily obscured. The 51 lightly obscured sources without known
counterparts fall into three groups. (i) Sixteen are likely new members of the
Orion Nebula Cluster. (ii) Two with unusually soft and non-flaring X-ray
emission appear to be associated with nebular shocks, and may be new examples
of X-rays produced at the bow shocks of Herbig-Haro outflows. (iii) The
remaining thirty three are very weak uncertain sources, possibly spurious. Out
of 234 heavily absorbed sources without optical or near-infrared counterparts
75 COUP sources are likely new embedded cloud members (with membership for 42
confirmed by powerful X-ray flares), and the remaining 159 are likely
extragalactic AGN seen through the molecular cloud, as argued by a careful
simulation of the extragalactic background population. Finally, a few new
binary companions to Orion stars may have been found, but most cases of
proximate COUP sources can be attributed to chance superpositions in this
crowded field.",2005-04-17T23:54:17Z
Gravity-wave detectors as probes of extra dimensions,"If string theory is correct, then our observable Universe may be a
3-dimensional ""brane"" embedded in a higher-dimensional spacetime. This
theoretical scenario should be tested via the state-of-the-art in gravitational
experiments -- the current and upcoming gravity-wave detectors. Indeed, the
existence of extra dimensions leads to oscillations that leave a spectroscopic
signature in the gravity-wave signal from black holes. The detectors that have
been designed to confirm Einstein's prediction of gravity waves, can in
principle also provide tests and constraints on string theory.",2005-05-13T09:15:02Z
A tiny Galactic dust cloud projected onto NGC 3269?,"We report on new observations obtained with the Magellan Clay-telescope of a

already been suspected to be a projected Galactic foreground cloud. In this
case a size of about 4 arcsec and a maximum absorption of ~1 mag in the B-band
would make it unique so far. We present further evidence for its Galactic
nature from imaging under excellent seeing conditions (0.3-0.6 arcsec). This
dust cloud could be the first optically identified counterpart of a new type of
molecular cloud recently discovered by Heithausen (2004).",2005-05-26T18:37:57Z
The Formation of Primordial Luminous Objects,"In these lecture notes we review the current knowledge about the formation of
the first luminous objects. We start from the cosmological context of
hierarchical models of structure formation, and discuss the main physical
processes which are believed to lead to primordial star formation, i.e. the
cooling processes and the chemistry of molecules (especially H2) in a
metal-free gas. We then describe the techniques and results of numerical
simulations, which indicate that the masses of the first luminous objects are
likely to be much larger than that of present-day stars. Finally, we discuss
the scenario presented above, exposing some of the most interesting problems
which are currently being investigated, such as that of the feedback effects of
these objects.",2005-07-06T12:40:12Z

"The Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) Survey of Galactic HI: Final data
  release of the combined LDS and IAR surveys with improved stray-radiation
  corrections","We present the final data release of observations of lambda 21-cm emission
from Galactic neutral hydrogen over the entire sky, merging the
Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey (LDS: Hartmann & Burton, 1997) of the sky north of
delta = -30 deg with the Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomia Survey (IAR:
Arnal et al., 2000, and Bajaja et al., 2005) of the sky south of delta = -25
deg. The angular resolution of the combined material is HPBW ~ 0.6 deg. The LSR
velocity coverage spans the interval -450 km/s to +400 km/s, at a resolution of
1.3 km/s. The data were corrected for stray radiation at the Institute for
Radioastronomy of the University of Bonn, refining the original correction
applied to the LDS. The rms brightness-temperature noise of the merged database
is 0.07 - 0.09 K. Residual errors in the profile wings due to defects in the
correction for stray radiation are for most of the data below a level of 20 -
40 mK. It would be necessary to construct a telescope with a main beam
efficiency of eta_{MB} > 99% to achieve the same accuracy. The merged and
refined material entering the LAB Survey of Galactic HI is intended to be a
general resource useful to a wide range of studies of the physical and
structural characteristices of the Galactic interstellar environment. The LAB

extensive coverage both spatially and kinematically.",2005-04-06T10:22:38Z
Extended emission around GPS radio sources,"Extended radio emission detected around a sample of GHz Peaked Spectrum (GPS)
radio sources is discussed. Evidence for extended emission which is related to
the GPS source is found in 6 objects out of 33. Three objects are associated
with quasars with core-jet pc-scale morphology, and three are identified with
galaxies with symmetric (CSO) radio morphology. We conclude that the core-jet
GPS quasars are likely to be beamed objects with a continuous supply of energy
from the core to the kpc scale. It is also possible that low surface brightness
extended radio emission is present in other GPS quasars but the emission is
below our detection limit due to the high redshifts of the objects. On the
other hand, the CSO/galaxies with extended large scale emission may be
rejuvenated sources where the extended emission is the relic of previous
activity. In general, the presence of large scale emission associated with GPS
galaxies is uncommon, suggesting that in the context of the recurrent activity
model, the time scale between subsequent bursts is in general longer than the
radiative lifetime of the radio emission from the earlier activity.",2005-07-21T08:44:37Z

Molecular Gas and Nuclear Activity in Radio Galaxies Detected by IRAS,"This paper reports the latest results from a millimeter-wave (CO)
spectroscopic survey of IRAS-detected radio galaxies with L_1.4GHz ~ 10^23-28
W/Hz in the redshift range z ~ 0.02-0.15. The IRAS flux-limited sample contains
33 radio galaxies with different radio morphologies and a broad range of
infrared luminosities L_IR = 10^9-12 L_sun), allowing for an investigation of
(a) whether low-z radio-selected AGN reside in molecular gas-rich host galaxes,
and (b) whether the CO properties are correlated with the properties of the
host galaxy or the AGN. All of the radio galaxies in Mazzarella et al. (1993)
and Mirabel et al. (1989) have been reobserved. Three new CO detections have
been made, raising the total number of CO detections to nine and setting the
survey detection rate at ~ 25%. Many of the CO lines have double-peaked
profiles, and the CO line widths are broad (average Delta v_FWHM ~ 500+/-130
km/s), exceeding the average CO widths of both ultraluminous infrared galaxies
(300+/-90 km/s) and Palomar-Green QSOs (260+/-160 km/s), and thus being
indicative of massive host galaxies. The CO luminosities translate into
molecular gas masses of ~ 0.4-7x10^9 M_sun, however, the 3-sigma CO upper
limits for nondetections do not rule out a molecular gas mass as high as that
of the Milky Way (~ 3x10^9 M_sun). Optical images of eight out of nine
molecular gas-rich radio galaxies show evidence of close companions and/or
tidal features. Finally, there is no obvious correlation between radio power
and molecular gas mass. However, it is notable that only one F-R II galaxy out
of 12 is detected in this CO survey; the remaining detections are of galaxies
hosting F-R I and compact radio jets.",2005-04-27T15:19:00Z
"HD 172189: An eclipsing and spectroscopic binary with a Delta Sct-ttype

172189, a new eclipsing binary system with a Delta Sct-type pulsating component
that belongs to the open cluster IC 4756. The great interest of this object
lies in that three important characteristics coexist: cluster membership,
binarity and pulsation. Its binarity and the Delta Sct-type pulsations of one
component were detected in the course of several Stromgren photometric
campaigns. The frequency analysis of all the uvby out-of-eclipse data reveals a
clear frequency of 19.5974 c/d as well as the existence of other high values in
the range 18-20 c/d. We have also carried out a first evaluation of the binary
parameters and determined a value of 5.702 d for the orbital period. An
additional potential interest of HD 172189 resides in its location in the field
of view of the COROT mission and, therefore, this star is an excellent
candidate for becoming a target for asteroseismology.",2005-06-03T11:10:18Z
"Analysis of medium resolution spectra by automated methods - application

the range 3800 to 5600 AA with resolutions of 2-3 AA to determine metallicities
from spectra of about 1000 main-sequence turn-off, subgiant and red giant stars
in the globular clusters M55 and omega Cen. The overall metallicity accuracies
are of the order of 0.15 to 0.2 dex. In addition, we tested how well the
stellar parameters logg and Teff can be retrieved from such data without
additional colour or photometric information. We find overall uncertainties of
0.3 to 0.4 dex for logg and 140 to 190 K for Teff. In order to obtain some
measure of uncertainty for the determined values of [Fe/H], logg and Teff, we
applied the bootstrap method for the first time to neural networks for this
kind of parametrization problem. The distribution of metallicities for stars in
omega Cen clearly shows a large spread in agreement with the well known

An XMM-Newton observation of Mrk 3 - a Seyfert galaxy just over the edge,"A 100ks XMM-Newton observation of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 3 offers a
unique opportunity to explore the complexity of its X-ray spectrum. We find the
\~3-8 keV continuum to be dominated by reflection from cold matter, with
fluorescent K-shell lines detected from Ni, Fe, Ca, Ar, S, Si and Mg. At higher
energies an intrinsic power law continuum, with canonical Seyfert 1 photon
index, is seen through a near-Compton-thick cold absorber. A soft excess below
\~3 keV is found to be dominated by line emission from an outflow of `warm'
gas, photo-ionised and photo-excited by the intrinsically strong X-ray
continuum. Measured blue-shifts in the strong Fe K-alpha and OVII and VIII
emission lines are discussed in terms of the properties of the putative
molecular torus and ionised outflow.",2005-04-14T15:25:55Z
Impact of non-uniform surface magnetic fields on stellar winds,"Observations of active stars reveal highly non-uniform surface distributions
of magnetic flux. Theoretical models considering magnetised stellar winds
however often presume uniform surface magnetic fields, characterised by a
single magnetic field strength. The present work investigates the impact of
non-uniform surface magnetic field distributions on the stellar mass and
angular momentum loss rates. The approach of Weber & Davis (1967) is extended
to non-equatorial latitudes to quantify the impact of latitude-dependent
magnetic field distributions over a large range of stellar rotation rates and
thermal wind properties. The analytically prescribed field patterns are
dominated by magnetic flux concentrations at intermediate and high latitudes.
The global stellar mass loss rates are found to be rather insensitive to
non-uniformities of the surface magnetic field. Depending on the non-uniformity
of the field distribution, the angular momentum loss rates deviate in contrast
at all rotation rates between -60% and 10% from the Weber & Davis-values, and
the effective Alfvenic radii up to about +/-25%. These large variations albeit
equal amounts of total magnetic flux indicate that a classification of stellar
surface magnetic fields through a single field strength is insufficient, and
that their non-uniformity has to be taken into account. The consequences for
applications involving magnetised stellar winds are discussed in view of the
rotational evolution of solar-like stars and of the observational determination
of their mass loss rates using the terminal velocity and ram pressure of the
wind. For rapidly rotating stars the latitudinal variation of the wind ram
pressure is found to exceed, depending on the actual field distribution on the

  Imprint on Cluster Gas, and Comparison to Observations","(Abridged) We study predictions for galaxy cluster observables that can test
the statistics of dark matter halo shapes expected in a flat LCDM universe. We
present a simple analytical model for the prediction of cluster-scale X-ray
observations, approximating clusters as isothermal systems in hydrostatic
equilibrium, and dark matter haloes as ellipsoids with uniform axial ratios. We
test the model against high-resolution, hydrodynamic cluster simulations to
gauge its reliability. We find that this simple prescription does a good job of
predicting the distribution of cluster X-ray ellipticities compared to the
simulations as long as one focuses on cluster regions that are less sensitive
to recent mergers. Based on this simple model, the distribution of cluster-size
halo shapes expected in the concordance LCDM cosmology implies an X-ray
ellipticity distribution with a mean of 0.32 +- 0.01 and a scatter of 0.14 +-
0.01 for the mass range (1-4)x10^{14} Msun/h. We find it important to include
the mass dependence of halo shape to make comparisons to observational samples
that contain many, very massive clusters. We analyse the systematics of four
observational samples of cluster ellipticities and find that our results are
statistically compatible with observations. In particular, we find remarkably
good agreement between two recent ROSAT samples and LCDM predictions that DO
NOT include gas cooling. We also test how well our analytical model can predict
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich decrement maps and find that it is less successful although
still useful; the model does not perform as well as a function of flux level in
this case because of the changing triaxiality of dark matter haloes as a
function of radial distance. Both this effect and the changing alignment of
isodensity shells of dark matter haloes leave an imprint on cluster gas...",2005-08-10T05:46:11Z
The earliest spectroscopy of the GRB 030329 afterglow with 6-m telescope,"The earliest BTA (SAO RAS 6-m telescope) spectroscopic observations of the
GRB 030329 optical transient (OT) are presented, which almost coincide in time
with the ""first break"" ($t\sim 0.5$ day after the GRB) of the OT light curve.
The beginning of spectral changes are seen as early as $\sim 10-12$ hours after
the GRB. So, the onset of the spectral changes for $t<1$ day indicates that the
contribution from Type Ic supernova (SN) into the OT optical flux can be
detected earlier. The properties of early spectra of GRB 030329/SN 2003dh can
be consistent with a shock moving into a stellar wind formed from the pre-SN.
Such a behavior (similar to that near the UV shock breakout in SNe) can be
explained by the existence of a dense matter in the immediate surroundings of
massive stellar GRB/SN progenitor). The urgency is emphasized of observation of
early GRB/SN spectra for solving a question that is essential for understanding
GRB physical mechanism: {\it Do all} long-duration gamma-ray bursts are caused
by (or physically connected to) {\it ordinary} core-collapse supernovae? If
clear association of normal/ordinary core-collapse SNe (SN Ib/c, and others SN
types) and GRBs would be revealed in numbers of cases, we may have strong
observational limits for gamma-ray beaming and for real energetics of the GRB
sources.",2005-05-26T13:34:44Z
"Non-Gaussianity of Large-Scale Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies
  beyond Perturbation Theory","We compute the fully non-linear Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropies on scales larger than the horizon at last-scattering in terms of
only the curvature perturbation, providing a generalization of the linear
Sachs-Wolfe effect at any order in perturbation theory. We show how to compute
the n-point connected correlation functions of the large-scale CMB anisotropies
for generic primordial seeds provided by standard slow-roll inflation as well
as the curvaton and other scenarios for the generation of cosmological
perturbations. As an application of our formalism, we compute the three- and
four-point connected correlation functions whose detection in future CMB
experiments might be used to assess the level of primordial non-Gaussianity,
giving the theoretical predictions for the parameters of quadratic and cubic
non-linearities f_NL and g_NL.",2005-06-17T12:57:58Z
"Supernova Remnants in the Magellanic Clouds. V. The Complex Interior
  Structure of the N206 SNR","The N206 supernova remnant (SNR) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has long
been considered a prototypical ""mixed morphology"" SNR. Recent observations,
however, have added a new twist to this familiar plot: an elongated,
radially-oriented radio feature seen in projection against the SNR face.
Utilizing the high resolution and sensitivity available with the Hubble Space
Telescope, Chandra, and XMM-Newton, we have obtained optical emission-line
images and spatially resolved X-ray spectral maps for this intriguing SNR. Our
findings present the SNR itself as a remnant in the mid to late stages of its
evolution. X-ray emission associated with the radio ""linear feature"" strongly
suggests it to be a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN). A small X-ray knot is discovered
at the outer tip of this feature. The feature's elongated morphology and the
surrounding wedge-shaped X-ray enhancement strongly suggest a bow-shock PWN
structure.",2005-04-27T17:53:55Z
The Milky Way's stellar halo - lumpy or triaxial?,"We present minimum chi-squared fits of power law and Hernquist density
profiles to F-turnoff stars in eight 2.5 deg wide stripes of SDSS data: five in
the North Galactic Cap and three in the South Galactic cap. Portions of the
stellar Galactic halo that are known to contain large streams of tidal debris
or other lumpy structure, or that may include significant contamination from
the thick disk, are avoided. The data strongly favor a model that is not
symmetric about the Galaxy's axis of rotation. If included as a free parameter,
the best fit to the center of the spheroid is surprisingly approx 3 kpc from
the Galactic center in the direction of the Sun's motion. The model fits favor
a low value of the density of halo stars at the solar position. The alternative
to a non-axisymmetric stellar distribution is that our fits are contaminated by
previously unidentified lumpy substructure.",2005-07-28T16:32:58Z
"Spatial fluctuations in the spectral shape of the UV background at 2<z<3
  and the reionization of helium","The low density hydrogen and helium in the IGM probed by QSO absorption lines
is sensitive to the amplitude and spectral shape of the metagalactic UV
background. We use realistic HI and HeII Ly-alpha forest spectra, constructed
from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of a Lambda-CDM Universe, to
confirm the reliability of using line profile fitting techniques to infer the
ratio of the metagalactic HI and HeII ionization rates. We further show that
the large spatial variations and the anti-correlation with HI absorber density
observed in the ratio of the measured HeII to HI column densities can be
explained in a model where the HI ionization rate is dominated by the combined
UV emission from young star forming galaxies and QSOs and the HeII ionization
rate is dominated by emission from QSOs only. In such a model the large
fluctuations in the column density ratio are due to the small number of QSOs
expected to contribute at any given point to the HeII ionization rate. A
significant contribution to UV emission at the HeII photoelectric edge from hot
gas in galaxies and galaxy groups would decrease the expected fluctuations in
the column density ratio. Consequently, this model appears difficult to
reconcile with the large increase in HeII opacity fluctuations towards higher
redshift. Our results further strengthen previous suggestions that observed
HeII Ly-alpha forest spectra at z~2-3.5 probe the tail end of the reionization
of HeII by QSOs.",2005-08-09T11:02:18Z
Gravitational Lensing of stars in the central arcsecond of our Galaxy,"In the neighborhood of Sgr A*, several stars (S2, S12, S14, S1, S8, S13)
enjoy an accurate determination of their orbital parameters. General Relativity
predicts that the central black hole acts as a gravitational lens on these
stars, generating a secondary image and two infinite series of relativistic
images. For each of these six stars, we calculate the light curves for the
secondary and the first two relativistic images, in the Schwarzschild black
hole hypothesis, throughout their orbital periods. The curves are peaked around
the periapse epoch, but two subpeaks may arise in nearly edge-on orbits, when
the source is behind or in front of Sgr A*. We show that for most of these
stars the secondary image should be observable during its brightness peak. In
particular, S14 is the best candidate, since its secondary image reaches K=23.3
with an angular separation of 0.125 mas from the apparent horizon of the
central black hole. The detection of such images by future instruments could
represent the first observation of gravitational lensing beyond the weak field
approximation.",2005-03-30T15:33:15Z
"An Excess Due to Small Grains Around The Nearby K0V Star HD69830:
  Asteroid or Cometary Debris?","Spitzer photometry and spectroscopy of the star HD69830 reveal an excess of
emission relative to the stellar photosphere between 8 and 35 $\mu$m dominated
by strong features attributable to crystalline silicates with an emitting
surface area more than 1,000 times that of our zodiacal cloud. The spectrum
closely resembles that of the comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp). Since no excess is
detected at 70 $\mu$m, the emitting material must be quite warm, be confined
within a few AU of the star, and originate in grains with low long-wavelength
emissivity, i.e. grains much smaller than $70 \mu$m$/2\pi\sim 10 $ $\mu$m. The
strong mineralogical features are evidence for even smaller, possibly
sub-micron sized grains. This small grain size is in direct contrast to the
10-100 $\mu$m grains that dominate the relatively featureless spectra of our
zodiacal dust cloud and most other main sequence stars with excesses. The upper
limit at 70 $\mu$m also implies that any Kuiper Belt analog must either be very
cold or be less massive than $\sim$ 5 times our own Kuiper Belt.
  With collisional and Poynting-Robertson drag times of about a thousand years
for small grains, the emitting material must either: a) be created through
continual grinding down of material in a dense asteroid belt; or b) originate
in cometary debris arising from either a single ``super-comet'' or a very large
number of individual comets arriving from a distant reservoir. In the case of a
cometary origin for the emission, the mass requirements for continuous
generation by many individual comets are unreasonable and we favor the capture
of a single ``super comet'' into a 0.5-1 AU orbit where it can evolve a large
number of small grains over a 2 Myr period.",2005-04-22T00:59:43Z
"Propagation of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays above $10^{19}$ eV in a
  Structured Extragalactic Magnetic Field and Galactic Magnetic Field","We present numerical simulations on propagation of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic
Rays (UHECRs) above $10^{19}$ eV in a structured extragalactic magnetic field
(EGMF) and simulate their arrival distributions at the earth. We use the IRAS
PSCz catalogue in order to construct a model of the EGMF and source models of
UHECRs, both of which reproduce the local structures observed around the Milky
Way. We also consider modifications of UHECR arrival directions by the galactic
magnetic field. We follow an inverse process of their propagation from the
earth and record the trajectories. This enables us to calculate only
trajectories of UHECRs arriving at the earth, which saves the CPU time. From
these trajectories and our source models, we construct arrival distributions of
UHECRs and calculate the harmonic amplitudes and the two point correlation
functions of them. We estimate number density of sources which reproduces the
Akeno Ground Air Shower Array (AGASA) observation best. As a result, we find
that the most appropriate number density of the sources is $\sim 5 \times
10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This constrains the source candidates of UHECRs. We also
demonstrate skymaps of their arrival distribution with the event number
expected by future experiments and examine how the EGMF affects their arrival
distribution. A main result is diffusion of clustering events which are
obtained from calculations in the absence of the EGMF. This tendency allows us
to reproduce the observed two point correlation function better.",2005-06-09T13:48:08Z
The Metallicity Distribution Function of Field Stars in M31's Bulge,"We have used Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2
observations to construct a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for the bulge of M31
at a location ~1.6 kpc from the galaxy's center. Using scaled-solar abundance
theoretical red giant branches with a range of metallicities, we have
translated the observed colors of the stars in the CMD to abundances and
constructed a metallicity distribution function (MDF) for this region. The MDF
shows a peak at [M/H]~0 with a steep decline at higher metallicities and a more
gradual tail to lower metallicities. This is similar in shape to the MDF of the
Milky Way bulge but shifted to higher metallicities by ~0.1 dex. As is the case
with the Milky Way bulge MDF, a pure closed box model of chemical evolution,
even with significant pre-enrichment, appears to be inconsistent with the M31
bulge MDF. However, a scenario in which an initial infall of gas enriched the
bulge to an abundance of [M/H] ~ -1.6 with subsequent evolution proceeding as a
closed box provides a better fit to the observed MDF. The similarity between
the MDF of the M31 bulge and that of the Milky Way stands in stark contrast to
the significant differences in the MDFs of their halo populations. This
suggests that the bulk of the stars in the bulges of both galaxies were in
place before the accretion events that occurred in the halos could influence
them.",2005-06-27T17:38:59Z
"Galaxy Morphologies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field: Dominance of Linear
  Structures at the Detection Limit","Galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) larger than 10 pixels (0.3
arcsec) have been classified according to morphology and their photometric
properties are presented. There are 269 spirals, 100 ellipticals, 114 chains,
126 double-clump, 97 tadpole, and 178 clump-cluster galaxies. We also
catalogued 30 B-band and 13 V-band drop-outs and calculated their star
formation rates. Chains, doubles, and tadpoles dominate the other types at
faint magnitudes. The fraction of obvious bars among spirals is ~10 percent, a
factor of 2-3 lower than in other deep surveys. The distribution function of
axial ratios for elliptical galaxies is similar to that seen locally,
suggesting that ellipticals relaxed quickly to a standardized shape. The
distribution of axial ratios for spiral galaxies is significantly different
than locally, having a clear peak at ~0.55 instead of a nearly flat
distribution. The fall-off at small axial ratio occurs at a higher value than
locally, indicating thicker disks by a factor of ~2. The fall-off at high axial
ratio could be from intrinsic triaxial shapes or selection effects. Inclined
disks should be more highly sampled than face-on disks near the surface
brightness limit of a survey. Simple models and data distributions demonstrate
these effects. The decreased numbers of obvious spiral galaxies at high
redshifts could be partly the result of surface brightness selection.",2005-08-09T19:26:11Z
"Vectorization and Parallelization of the Adaptive Mesh Refinement N-body
  Code","In this paper, we describe our vectorized and parallelized adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) N-body code with shared time steps, and report its performance
on a Fujitsu VPP5000 vector-parallel supercomputer. Our AMR N-body code puts
hierarchical meshes recursively where higher resolution is required and the
time step of all particles are the same. The parts which are the most difficult
to vectorize are loops that access the mesh data and particle data. We
vectorized such parts by changing the loop structure, so that the innermost
loop steps through the cells instead of the particles in each cell, in other
words, by changing the loop order from the depth-first order to the
breadth-first order. Mass assignment is also vectorizable using this loop order
exchange and splitting the loop into $2^{N_{dim}}$ loops, if the cloud-in-cell
scheme is adopted. Here, $N_{dim}$ is the number of dimension. These
vectorization schemes which eliminate the unvectorized loops are applicable to
parallelization of loops for shared-memory multiprocessors. We also
parallelized our code for distributed memory machines. The important part of
parallelization is data decomposition. We sorted the hierarchical mesh data by
the Morton order, or the recursive N-shaped order, level by level and split and
allocated the mesh data to the processors. Particles are allocated to the
processor to which the finest refined cells including the particles are also
assigned. Our timing analysis using the $\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter
simulations shows that our parallel code speeds up almost ideally up to 32
processors, the largest number of processors in our test.",2005-07-14T07:45:44Z
Planetary migration,"Gravitational torques between a planet and gas in the protoplanetary disk
result in orbital migration of the planet, and are likely to play an important
role in the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. For masses
comparable to those of observed giant extrasolar planets, the interaction with
the disk is strong enough to form a gap, leading to coupled evolution of the
planet and disk on a viscous time scale (Type II migration). Both the existence
of hot Jupiters, and the statistical distribution of observed orbital radii,
are consistent with an important role for Type II migration in the history of
currently observed systems. We discuss the possibility of improving constraints
on migration by including information on the host stars' metallicity, and note
that migration could also form a population of massive planets at large orbital
radii that may be indirectly detected via their influence on debris disks. For
lower mass planets with masses of the order of that of the Earth, surface
density perturbations created by the planet are small, and migration in a
laminar disk is driven by an intrinsic and apparently robust asymmetry between
interior and exterior torques. Analytic and numerical calculations of this Type
I migration are in reasonable accord, and predict rapid orbital decay during
the final stages of the formation of giant planet cores. The difficulty of
reconciling Type I migration with giant planet formation may signal basic
errors in our understanding of protoplanetary disks, core accretion, or both.
We discuss physical effects that might alter Type I behavior, in particular the
possibility that for sufficiently low masses turbulent fluctuations in the gas
surface density dominate the torque, leading to random walk migration of very
low mass bodies.",2005-07-20T21:06:43Z
"The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey: Evolution of the non-linear galaxy bias up to
  z=1.5","We present the first measurements of the Probability Distribution Function
(PDF) of galaxy fluctuations in the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) cone, covering
0.4x0.4 deg between 0.4<z<1.5. The second moment of the PDF, i.e. the rms
fluctuations of the galaxy density field, is with good approximation constant
over the full redshift baseline investigated: we find that, in redshift space,
sigma_8 for galaxies brighter than M=-20+5log h has a mean value of 0.94\pm0.07
in the redshift interval 0.7<z<1.5. The third moment, i.e. the skewness,
increases with cosmic time: we find that the probability of having underdense
regions is greater at z~0.7 than it was at z~1.5. By comparing the PDF of
galaxy density contrasts with the theoretically predicted PDF of mass
fluctuations we infer the redshift-, density-, and scale-dependence of the
biasing function b(z, \delta, R) between galaxy and matter overdensities up to
redshift z=1.5. Our results can be summarized as follows: i) the galaxy bias is
an increasing function of redshift: evolution is marginal up to z~0.8 and more
pronounced for z>0.8; ii) the formation of bright galaxies is inhibited below a
characteristic mass-overdensity threshold whose amplitude increases with
redshift and luminosity; iii) the biasing function is non linear in all the
redshift bins investigated with non-linear effects of the order of a few to 10%
on scales >5Mpc.",2005-06-23T14:43:17Z
Strong mean field dynamos require supercritical helicity fluxes,"Several one and two dimensional mean field models are analyzed where the
effects of current helicity fluxes and boundaries are included within the
framework of the dynamical quenching model. In contrast to the case with
periodic boundary conditions, the final saturation energy of the mean field
decreases inversely proportional to the magnetic Reynolds number. If a
nondimensional scaling factor in the current helicity flux exceeds a certain
critical value, the dynamo can operate even without kinetic helicity, i.e. it
is based only on shear and current helicity fluxes, as first suggested by
Vishniac & Cho (2001, ApJ 550, 752). Only above this threshold is the current
helicity flux also able to alleviate catastrophic quenching. The fact that
certain turbulence simulations have now shown apparently non-resistively
limited mean field saturation amplitudes may be suggestive of the current
helicity flux having exceeded this critical value. Even below this critical
value the field still reaches appreciable strength at the end of the kinematic
phase, which is in qualitative agreement with dynamos in periodic domains.
However, for large magnetic Reynolds numbers the field undergoes subsequent
variations on a resistive time scale when, for long periods, the field can be
extremely weak.",2005-05-23T19:41:59Z
Seeing the Nature of the Accelerating Physics: It's a SNAP,"For true insight into the nature of dark energy, measurements of the

distinguishing the cosmological constant. This white paper presents an overview
of the necessity for SNAP and the role of precursor experiments; accompanying

"Constraints on the dark energy equation of state from the separation of
  CMB peaks and the evolution of alpha","We introduce a simple parametrization of the dark energy equation of state,
\omega, which is motivated from theory and recent experimental data. The theory
is related to the tracker solution to alleviate the fine tuning problem. Recent
experimental data indicates that the present value of \omega is close to -1. We
analyze the evolution of \omega from the separation of CMB peaks and the time
variation of the fine structure constant, \alpha. We find that -1.00 \leq
\omega^{(0)} \leq -0.971_{-0.027}^{+0.017} and 1.76_{-0.42}^{+0.29} \times
10^{-4} \leq (d \omega / dz)_{z=0} \leq 0.041_{-0.037}^{+0.016} at 95%

"Searching for merger debris in the Galactic halo: Chemodynamical
  evidence based on local blue HB stars","We report on the discovery of a group of local A-type blue horizontal-branch
(HBA) stars moving in a prograde, comet-like orbit with very similar kinematics
and abundances. This serendipitously discovered group contains 5 or 6 local HBA
stars venturing very close to the Galactic centre; their [Fe/H] is around -1.7,
and they seem to present minimum scatter in at least Mg, Si, Ti, Fe, Al, and Cr
abundances. This ``Cometary Orbit Group'' (COG) was found while we were testing
a new method to detect the debris associated with the merger of smaller,
specific protogalactic entities into our galaxy. The method is primarily
intended to identify field HBA stars with similar kinematics and detailed,
multi-species abundance patterns as seen among members of a surviving remnant
(e.g., omega Centauri). Quite possibly, the COG is the remnant, on a highly
decayed orbit, of a merging event that took place in the relatively remote past
(i.e., at least one revolution ago).",2005-07-02T00:36:34Z
"On the Meaning and Inapplicability of the Zeldovich Relations of
  Magnetohydrodynamics","Considering a plasma with an initially weak large scale field subject to
nonhelical turbulent stirring, Zeldovich (1957), for two-dimensions, followed
by others for three dimensions, and Zeldovich et al. (1983) have presented
formulae of the form $<b^2>=f(R_M){Bbar}^2$. Such ``Zeldovich relations'' have
sometimes been interpreted to provide steady-state relations between the energy
associated with the fluctuating magnetic field and that associated with a large
scale or mean field multiplied by a function $f$ that depends on spatial
dimension and a magnetic Reynolds number $R_M$. Here we dissect the origin of
these relations and pinpoint pitfalls that show why they are inapplicable to
realistic, dynamical MHD turbulence and that they disagree with many numerical
simulations. For 2-D, we show that when the total magnetic field is determined
by a vector potential, the standard Zeldovich relation applies only
transiently, characterizing a maximum possible value that the field energy can
reach before necessarily decaying. in relation to a seed value $Bbar$. In 3-D,
we show that the standard Zeldovich relations are derived by balancing
subdominant terms. In contrast, balancing the dominant terms shows that the
fluctuating field can grow to a value independent of $R_M$ and the initially
imposed $Bbar$, as seen in numerical simulations. We also emphasize that these
Zeldovich relations of nonhelical turbulence imply nothing about the amount
mean field growth in a helical dynamo. In short, by re-analyzing the origin of
the Zeldovich relations, we highlight that they are inapplicable to realistic
steady-states of large $R_M$ MHD turbulence.",2005-04-22T18:43:15Z
"Spectral analysis of early-type stars using a genetic algorithm based
  fitting method","We present the first automated fitting method for the quantitative
spectroscopy of O- and early B-type stars with stellar winds. The method
combines the non-LTE stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND from Puls et al. (2005)
with the genetic algorithm based optimizing routine PIKAIA from Charbonneau
(1995), allowing for a homogeneous analysis of upcoming large samples of
early-type stars (e.g. Evans et al. 2005). In this first implementation we use
continuum normalized optical hydrogen and helium lines to determine
photospheric and wind parameters. We have assigned weights to these lines
accounting for line blends with species not taken into account, lacking
physics, and/or possible or potential problems in the model atmosphere code. We
find the method to be robust, fast, and accurate. Using our method we analysed
seven O-type stars in the young cluster Cyg OB2 and five other Galactic stars
with high rotational velocities and/or low mass loss rates (including 10lac,
zeta Oph, and tau Sco) that have been studied in detail with a previous version
of FASTWIND. The fits are found to have a quality that is comparable or even
better than produced by the classical ``by eye'' method. We define errorbars on
the model parameters based on the maximum variations of these parameters in the
models that cluster around the global optimum. Using this concept, for the
investigated dataset we are able to recover mass-loss rates down to ~6d-8
Msun/yr to within an error of a factor of two. Comparison of our derived
spectroscopic masses with those derived from stellar evolutionary models are in
very good agreement, i.e. based on the limited sample that we have studied we
do not find indications for a mass discrepancy.",2005-06-30T10:21:26Z
"The location of the broad HI absorption in 3C305: clear evidence for a
  jet-accelerated neutral outflow","We present high-spatial resolution 21-cm HI VLA observations of the radio
galaxy 3C305 (z=0.041). These new high-resolution data show that the ~1000 km/s
broad HI absorption, earlier detected in low-resolution WSRT observations, is
occurring against the bright, eastern radio lobe, about 1.6 kpc from the
nucleus. We use new optical spectra taken with the WHT to make a detailed
comparison of the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen with that of the ionised
gas. The striking similarity between the complex kinematics of the two gas
phases suggests that both the ionised gas and the neutral gas are part of the
same outflow. Earlier studies of the ionised gas had already found evidence for
a strong interaction between the radio jet and the interstellar medium at the
location of the eastern radio lobe. Our results show that the fast outflow
produced by this interaction also contains a component of neutral atomic
hydrogen. The most likely interpretation is that the radio jet ionises the ISM
and accelerates it to the high outflow velocities observed. Our observations
demonstrate that, following this strong jet-cloud interaction, not all gas
clouds are destroyed and that part of the gas can cool and become neutral. The
mass outflow rate measured in 3C~305 is comparable, although at the lower end
of the distribution, to that found in Ultra-Luminous IR galaxies. This suggests
that AGN-driven outflows, and in particular jet-driven outflows, can have a
similar impact on the evolution of a galaxy as starburst-driven superwinds.",2005-05-18T07:45:59Z
Dust-enshrouded giants in clusters in the Magellanic Clouds,"We present the results of an investigation of post-Main Sequence mass loss
from stars in clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, based around an imaging survey
in the L'-band (3.8 micron) performed with the VLT at ESO. The data are
complemented with JHKs and mid-IR photometry. The goal is to determine the
influence of initial metallicity and initial mass on the mass loss and
evolution during the latest stages of stellar evolution. Dust-enshrouded giants
are identified by their reddened near-IR colours and thermal-IR dust excess
emission. Most of these objects are Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) carbon stars
in intermediate-age clusters, with progenitor masses between 1.3 and about 5
Msun. Red supergiants with circumstellar dust envelopes are found in young
clusters, and have progenitor masses between 13 and 20 Msun. Post-AGB objects
(e.g., Planetary Nebulae) and massive stars with detached envelopes and/or hot
central stars are found in several clusters. We model the spectral energy
distributions of the cluster IR objects to estimate their bolometric
luminosities and mass-loss rates. The IR objects are the most luminous cluster
objects, and have luminosities as expected for their initial mass and
metallicity. They experience mass-loss rates in the range from a few 1e-6 up to
1e-4 Msun/yr (or more), with most of the spread being due to evolutionary
effects and only a weak dependence on progenitor mass and/or initial
metallicity. About half of the mass lost by 1.3--3 Msun stars is shed during
the superwind phase, which lasts of order 1e5 yr. Objects with detached shells
are found to have experienced the highest mass-loss rates, and are therefore
interpreted as post-superwind objects. We also propose a simple method to
measure the cluster mass from L'-band images.",2005-07-25T10:02:44Z
On the origin of bimodal duration distribution of Gamma Ray Bursts,"The modified version of a bullet model for gamma ray bursts is studied. The

takes part in an infinitesimally thin shell, or during its expansion for a
finite time. The analysis of the observed profiles of GRBs taken by BATSE leads
us to the conclusion that the latter possibility is much more favored. We also
study the statistical distribution of GRBs, in the context of their bimodality
of durations, taking into account the detector's capability of observing the
signal above a certain flux limit. The model with shells emitting for a finite
time is able to reproduce only one class of bursts, short or long, depending on
the adopted physical parameters. Therefore we suggest that the GRB bimodality
is intrinsically connected with two separate classes of sources.",2005-07-06T10:02:40Z
Spectroscopic and Photometric Observations of SN IIn 1995N,"We present the results of a long-term program of monitoring of the famous SN
1995N, observed both in photometry (UBVRIJHK bands) and optical spectroscopy.
The observations span a period of about 9 years. These new data, together with
others available in literature, extend from the X-ray wavelengths to the radio,
and allow to estimate the total energy radiated by the supernova over a decade
after its explosion.",2005-04-05T16:35:09Z
The peculiar velocities of satellites of external disk galaxies,"We analyze the angular distribution and the orbital rotation directions of a
sample of carefully-selected satellite galaxies extracted from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We also study these statistics in an N-body
simulation of cosmological structure formation set within the LCDM paradigm
under various assumptions for the orientations of disk angular momenta.
Assuming that the angular momenta of the disks are aligned with the angular
momenta of the inner regions of their host dark matter halos, we find that the
fraction of simulated satellite halos that exhibit prograde motion is
0.55-0.60, with larger satellites more likely to be prograde. In our
observational sample, approximately 60% of the satellites exhibit prograde
motion, a result that is broadly consistent with the simulated sample. Contrary
to several recent studies, our observational sample of satellite galaxies show
no evidence for being anisotropically distributed about their primary disks.
Again, this result is broadly consistent with our simulated sample of
satellites under the assumption that disk and halo angular momenta are aligned.
However, the small size of our observational sample does not yet allow us to
distinguish between various assumptions regarding the orientations of disks in
their halos. Finally, we assessed the importance of contamination by
interlopers on the measured prograde and retrograde statistics.",2005-06-22T19:39:33Z
"Discovery and Monitoring of the likely IR Counterpart of SGR 1806-20
  during the 2004 gamma-ray burst-active state","The sky region including the Chandra position of SGR 1806-20 was monitored in
the IR band during 2004, following its increased high energy bursting activity.
Observations were performed using NAOS-CONICA, the adaptive optics IR camera
mounted on Yepun VLT, which provided images of unprecedented quality (FWHM
better than 0.1""). After the 2004 December 27th giant flare, the source
position has been nailed by VLA observations of its radio counterpart, reducing
the positional uncertainty to 0.04"". Using IR data from our monitoring
campaign, we discovered the likely IR counterpart to SGR 1806-20 based on
positional coincidence with the Chandra and VLA uncertainty regions and flux
variability of a factor of about 2 correlated with that at higher energies. We
compare our findings with other isolated neutron star classes thought to be
related, at some level, with SGRs.",2005-06-04T17:39:07Z
"Towards Planetesimals in the Disk around TW Hya: 3.5 centimeter Dust
  Emission","We present Very Large Array observations at 3.5 cm of the nearby young star
TW Hya that show the emission is constant in time over weeks, months and years,
and spatially resolved with peak brightness temperature ~10 K at ~0.25 (15 AU)
resolution. These features are naturally explained if the emission mechanism at
this wavelength is thermal emission from dust particles in the disk surrounding
the star. To account quantitatively for the observations, we construct a
self-consistent accretion disk model that incorporates a population of
centimeter size particles that matches the long wavelength spectrum and spatial
distribution. A substantial mass fraction of orbiting particles in the TW Hya
disk must have agglomerated to centimeter size. These data provide the first
clear indication that dust emission from protoplanetary disks may be observed
at centimeter wavelengths, and that changes in the spectral slope of the dust
emission may be detected, providing constraints on dust evolution and the
planet formation process.",2005-06-27T13:59:47Z
"Gravitational waves, inflation and the cosmic microwave background:
  towards testing the slow-roll paradigm","One of the fundamental and yet untested predictions of inflationary models is
the generation of a very weak cosmic background of gravitational radiation. We
investigate the sensitivity required for a space-based gravitational wave laser
interferometer with peak sensitivity at $\sim 1$ Hz to observe such signal as a
function of the model parameters and compare it with indirect limits that can
be set with data from present and future cosmic microwave background missions.
We concentrate on signals predicted by slow-roll single field inflationary
models and instrumental configurations such as those proposed for the LISA
follow-on mission: Big Bang Observer.",2005-04-13T10:44:53Z
General Relativity Resolves Galactic Rotation Without Exotic Dark Matter,"A galaxy is modeled as a stationary axially symmetric pressure-free fluid in
general relativity. For the weak gravitational fields under consideration, the
field equations and the equations of motion ultimately lead to one linear and
one nonlinear equation relating the angular velocity to the fluid density. It
is shown that the rotation curves for the Milky Way, NGC 3031, NGC 3198 and NGC
7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter
concentrated in flattened disks. Thus the need for a massive halo of exotic
dark matter is removed. For these galaxies we determine the mass density for
the luminous threshold as 10^{-21.75} kg.m$^{-3}.",2005-07-26T19:39:16Z
Optical Depths and Timescale Distributions in Galactic Microlensing,"We present microlensing calculations for a Galactic model based on Han &
Gould (2003), which is empirically normalised by star counts. We find good
agreement between this model and data recently published by the MACHO and OGLE
collaborations for the optical depth in various Galactic fields, and the trends
thereof with Galactic longitude l and latitude b. We produce maps of optical
depth and, by adopting simple kinematic models, of average event timescales for
microlensing towards the Galactic bulge. We also find that our model
predictions are in reasonable agreement with the OGLE data for the expected
timescale distribution. We show that the fractions of events with very long and
short timescales due to a lens of mass M are weighted by M^2 n(M)dM and M^(-1)
n(M)dM respectively, independent of the density and kinematics of the lenses.",2005-07-08T16:10:18Z
"A new estimate of the Galactic interstellar radiation field between 0.1
  microns and 1000 microns","Cosmic-ray electrons and positrons propagating in the Galaxy produce diffuse
gamma-rays via the inverse Compton (IC) process. The low energy target photon
populations with which the cosmic-rays interact during propagation are produced
by stars, this stellar light being reprocessed by Galactic dust. Detailed
modelling of the Galactic stellar distribution, dust distribution, and
treatment of the absorption and scattering of light is therefore required to
obtain accurate models for the low energy Galactic photon distribution and
spectrum. Using a realistic Galactic stellar distribution model, and dust
distribution, we calculate the diffuse radiation field from stars in the Galaxy
(the `optical' radiation field), including absorption and scattering. Using a
dust heating code, we self-consistently calculate the infra-red radiation field
for the same dust model used for the optical calculation; both transient and
equilibrium heating are included. We present the calculated radiation field
spectra and distributions, and will use these to calculate the expected
Galactic diffuse IC gamma-ray spectrum.",2005-07-06T04:31:05Z
HST/ACS Lyman alpha imaging of the nearby starburst ESO338-IG04,"ESO338-IG04 is a well known, local, luminous Blue Compact Galaxy. It has a
complex morphology and contains a central young starburst with compact young
star clusters. The galaxy was imaged using HST/ACS in the Lyman alpha line and
continuum. Using the Starburst99 synthetic spectra and other imaging data from
HST/WFPC2 we developed a technique that allows us to make the first
photometrically valid continuum subtraction for the LYa line. Our results are
in qualitative agreement with the models of LYa escape being regulated by
kinematical properties of the interstellar medium. The line-only image shows
LYa in both emission and absorption. Notably, emission is seen from central
bright young clusters and is in spatial agreement with the features present in
a longslit spectrum taken with HST/STIS. Diffuse LYa emission regions are seen
surrounding the central starburst where photons escape after one or more
resonant scatterings in HI. These regions dominate the total LYa output.
Photometry reveals a total LYa flux of 194 x 10^-14 erg/s/cm^2. Inside an
artificial aperture matching that of the IUE satelite, we measure a LYa flux
and equivalent width consistent with previous studies using the IUE. Analysis
of parameter dependencies show our technique to be largely parameter
independent, producing LYa maps indistinguishable from one another by eye and
with fluxes consistent with one another to better than 50%. By comparison of
LYa fluxes with Ha fluxes of a previous study, we estimate that each observed
LYa photon has undergone ~2 additional scatterings. We see that LYa line
closely correlate with other tracers of kinematics.",2005-03-15T16:46:13Z
Turbulence Statistics from Spectral Line Observations,"Turbulence is a crucial component of dynamics of astrophysical fluids
dynamics, including those of ISM, clusters of galaxies and circumstellar
regions. Doppler shifted spectral lines provide a unique source of information
on turbulent velocities. We discuss Velocity-Channel Analysis (VCA) and its
offspring Velocity Coordinate Spectrum (VCS) that are based on the analytical
description of the spectral line statistics. Those techniques are well suited
for studies of supersonic turbulence. We stress that a great advantage of VCS
is that it does not necessary require good spatial resolution. Addressing the
studies of mildly supersonic and subsonic turbulence we discuss the criterion
that allows to determine whether Velocity Centroids are dominated by density or
velocity. We briefly discuss ways of going beyond power spectra by using of
higher order correlations as well as genus analysis. We outline the relation
between Spectral Correlation Functions and the statistics available through VCA
and VCS.",2005-05-28T23:13:26Z
"Spectral analysis of early-type stars using a genetic algorithm based
  fitting method","We present the first automated fitting method for the quantitative
spectroscopy of O- and early B-type stars with stellar winds. The method
combines the non-LTE stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND from Puls et al. (2005)
with the genetic algorithm based optimizing routine PIKAIA from Charbonneau
(1995), allowing for a homogeneous analysis of upcoming large samples of
early-type stars (e.g. Evans et al. 2005). In this first implementation we use
continuum normalized optical hydrogen and helium lines to determine
photospheric and wind parameters. We have assigned weights to these lines
accounting for line blends with species not taken into account, lacking
physics, and/or possible or potential problems in the model atmosphere code. We
find the method to be robust, fast, and accurate. Using our method we analysed
seven O-type stars in the young cluster Cyg OB2 and five other Galactic stars
with high rotational velocities and/or low mass loss rates (including 10lac,
zeta Oph, and tau Sco) that have been studied in detail with a previous version
of FASTWIND. The fits are found to have a quality that is comparable or even
better than produced by the classical ``by eye'' method. We define errorbars on
the model parameters based on the maximum variations of these parameters in the
models that cluster around the global optimum. Using this concept, for the
investigated dataset we are able to recover mass-loss rates down to ~6d-8
Msun/yr to within an error of a factor of two. Comparison of our derived
spectroscopic masses with those derived from stellar evolutionary models are in
very good agreement, i.e. based on the limited sample that we have studied we
do not find indications for a mass discrepancy.",2005-06-30T10:21:26Z
The Metallicity - Kinematics Relation in Large-N(HI) Absorbers,"Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar spectroscopy is yielding a database of
strong low-ionization MgII absorbers over the redshift interval 0.36<z<2.28
which is over two orders of magnitude larger than anything previously
assembled. HST UV spectroscopy has been used to measure neutral hydrogen column
densities for a small subset of them. These data empirically show that MgII
absorbers with rest equivalent widths $W^{\lambda2796}_0 \ge 0.6$ \AA have a
mean neutral hydrogen column density that is roughly constant at $N(HI) \approx
4 \times 10^{20}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$, with individual systems lying in the damped
Ly-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA regimes. Since the MgII doublets generally exhibit
saturation, the $W^{\lambda2796}_0$ values are an indication of the absorbers'
velocity spreads. Thus, we can study neutral-gas-phase metallicities as a
function of kinematics by forming SDSS composite spectra and measuring weak
unsaturated metal lines that form in neutral gas (e.g., CrII, FeII, MnII, SiII,
ZnII) as a function of $W^{\lambda2796}_0$. We use this method on SDSS
composite spectra to show how metallicity and kinematics are positively
correlated for large N(HI) absorbers, including trends related to dust
depletion and the enhancement of alpha-elements. We also discuss the need to
account for selection effects in DLA surveys, and we make inferences about
models for DLA absorption and their contribution to cosmic star formation.",2005-06-28T16:02:51Z
Radiative transfer in decomposed domains,"An efficient algorithm for calculating radiative transfer on massively
parallel computers using domain decomposition is presented. The integral
formulation of the transfer equation is used to divide the problem into a local
but compute-intensive part for calculating the intensity and optical depth
integrals, and a nonlocal part for communicating the intensity between adjacent
processors. The waiting time of idle processors during the nonlocal
communication part does not have a severe impact on the scaling. The wall clock
time thus scales nearly linearly with the inverse number of processors.",2005-03-23T21:08:08Z
"Simulations and parametrisation of radio emission from cosmic ray air
  showers","Cosmic ray air showers are known to emit pulsed radio emission at frequencies
around a few tens of MHz. Accompanying the experimental efforts of the LOPES
project, situated at the KASCADE-Grande site of the Forschungszentrum
Karlsruhe, we have modeled the underlying emission mechanism in the scheme of
coherent geosynchrotron radiation from electron-positron pairs deflected in the
earth's magnetic field. As a follow-up to our earlier analytical calculations,
we have developed a Monte Carlo simulation based on analytic parametrisations
of air shower properties, including longitudinal and lateral particle
distributions, particle energy and track-length distributions, and the
longitudinal shower development as a whole. Here we present detailed simulation
results. Important findings are the absence of significant asymmetries in the
total field strength emission pattern in spite of the asymmetry introduced by
the geomagnetic field, the polarisation characteristics of the geosynchrotron
emission, allowing an unambiguous test of the geomagnetic emission mechanism,
and the dependence of the radio emission on important shower parameters such as
the shower zenith angle, the primary particle energy and the depth of the
shower maximum. As a particularly useful result, these dependences have been
summarized in a simple parametrisation formula, providing a solid basis for the
interpretation of experimental data gathered with current and future
experiments.",2005-07-01T12:57:23Z
"Spectral Variability of Quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I:
  Wavelength Dependence","Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) repeat spectroscopic observations have
resulted in multiple-epoch spectroscopy for roughly 2500 quasars observed more
than 50 days apart. From this sample, we identify 315 quasars that have varied
significantly between observations. We create an ensemble difference spectrum
(bright phase minus faint phase) covering rest-frame wavelengths from 1000 to
6000 Angstroms. This average difference spectrum is bluer than the average
single-epoch quasar spectrum; a power-law fit to the difference spectrum yields
a spectral index alpha_lambda = -2.00, compared to an index of alpha_lambda =
-1.35 for the single-epoch spectrum. The strongest emission lines vary only 30%
as much as the continuum. Due to the lack of variability of the lines, measured
photometric color is not always bluer in brighter phases, but depends on
redshift and the filters used. Lastly, the difference spectrum is bluer than
the ensemble quasar spectrum only for lambda_rest < 2500 Angstroms, indicating
that the variability cannot result from a simple scaling of the average quasar
spectrum.",2005-04-13T20:56:55Z
HST Imaging of MEGA Microlensing Candidates in M31,"We investigate $HST$/ACS and WFPC2 images at the positions of five candidate
microlensing events from a large survey of variability in M31 (MEGA). Three
closely match unresolved sources, and two produce only flux upper limits. All
are confined to regions of the color-magnitude diagram where stellar
variability is unlikely to be easily confused with microlensing. Red variable
stars cannot explain these events (although background supernova are possible
for two). If these lenses arise in M31's halo, they are due to masses $0.15 < m
/ M_\odot < 0.49$ (95% certainty, for a $\delta$-function mass distribution),
brown dwarfs for disk lenses, and stellar masses for bulge lenses.",2005-07-12T13:46:02Z

Normal Nearby Galaxies,"Following on from IRAS, ISO has provided a huge advancement in our knowledge
of the phenomenology of the infrared (IR) emission of normal galaxies and the
underlying physical processes. Highlights include: the discovery of an extended
cold dust emission component, present in all types of gas-rich galaxies and
carrying the bulk of the dust luminosity; the definitive characterisation of
the spectral energy distribution in the IR, revealing the channels through
which stars power the IR light; the derivation of realistic geometries for
stars and dust from ISO imaging; the discovery of cold dust associated with HI
extending beyond the optical body of galaxies; the remarkable similarity of the
near-IR (NIR)/ mid-IR (MIR) SEDs for spiral galaxies, revealing the importance
of the photo-dissociation regions in the energy budget for that wavelength
range; the importance of the emission from the central regions in shaping up
the intensity and the colour of the global MIR luminosity; the discovery of the
``hot'' NIR continuum emission component of interstellar dust; the predominance
of the diffuse cold neutral medium as the origin for the main interstellar
cooling line, [CII] 158 micron, in normal galaxies.",2005-06-30T18:30:57Z

tiny, discrete clouds in the diffuse ISM, with peak optical depths tau ~
0.1-2%, HI column densities of 0.4-8 * 10^{18} cm^{-2} and core temperatures of
20-80 K. Imaging detections confirm these low column densities and imply linear
core dimensions of a few thousand AU, assuming a distance of 100 pc. The
physical origin of these tiny HI structures and their distribution in the ISM
is at present unknown. Further observations will be required to determine
whether they are a ubiquitous component of the ISM.",2005-05-03T13:25:58Z
Discovery of VHE Gamma Rays from PKS 2005-489,"The high-frequency peaked BL Lac PKS 2005-489 (z=0.071) was observed in 2003
and 2004 with the H.E.S.S. stereoscopic array of imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov
telescopes in Namibia. A signal was detected at the 6.7 sigma level in the 2004
observations (24.2 hrs live time), but not in the 2003 data set (27.3 hrs live
time). PKS 2005-489 is the first blazar independently discovered by H.E.S.S. to
be an emitter of VHE photons, and only the second such blazar in the Southern
Hemisphere. The integral flux above 200 GeV observed in 2004 is (6.9 +/- 1.0
+/- 1.4) x 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to ~2.5% of the flux
observed from the Crab Nebula. The 99% upper limit on the flux in 2003, I(>200
GeV) < 5.2 x 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, is smaller than the flux measured
in 2004, suggesting an increased level of activity in 2004. However, the data
show no evidence for significant variability on any time scale less than a
year. An energy spectrum is measured and is characterized by a very soft power
law (photon index = 4.0 +/- 0.4).",2005-04-23T15:14:27Z
"Photometric monitoring of the doubly imaged quasar UM673: possible
  evidence for chromatic microlensing","We present the results of two-band CCD photometric monitoring of the
gravitationally lensed quasar Q 0142-100 (UM 673).The data, obtained at ESO-La
Silla with the 1.54 m Danish telescope in the Gunn i-band (October 1998 -
September 1999) and in the Johnson V-band (October 1998 to December 2001), were
analyzed using three different photometric methods. The light-curves obtained
with all methods show variations, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.14
magnitude in $V$. Although it was not possible to measure the time delay
between the two lensed QSO images, the brighter component displays possible
evidence for microlensing: it becomes bluer as it gets brighter, as expected
under the assumption of differential magnification of a quasar accretion disk",2005-07-07T10:54:39Z
The intriguing giant bow shocks near HH 131,"Using the High Dispersion Spectrograph at the Subaru Telescope, echelle
spectra of two giant arcs, i.e. nebulosities Cw and L associated with HH 131 in
Orion are presented. Typical emission lines of Herbig-Haro objects have been
detected towards Cw. With the 2.16 m telescope of National Astronomical
Observatories, spectra of Nebu. C, L and K are obtained, which also show strong
[SII]6717/6731, H$\alpha$ and [NII]6583 emission lines. Position-velocity
distributions of Cw and L are analyzed. The fastest radial velocity of Cw is
V_r ~ -18.0 km/s. When the flow at L goes to the south, it slows down. The
fastest radial velocity of L has been observed of -45.0 km/s and the slowest
value is about -18.3 km/s. The similarity of the velocities and their
positional connection indicate that Cw and L are physically associated. The
entire flow tends to become less excited and less ionized when going further to
the south (i.e., from Nebu. K, L to C). The electron densities of all the
observed nebulosities are low (n_e ~ 10^2 cm^-3). Double kinematic signatures
have been found in Cw from its [NII]6583 profiles while the observed H$\alpha$
profiles of Cw are almost symmetric. Bow shock models appear to agree with the
observed position-velocity diagrams of the [NII spectra better than H$\alpha$
spectra. With the suggestion that these arcs are HH shocks possibly ejected out
of the Orion A molecular cloud by an uncertain source, their spectra show low
to intermediate excitation from their diagnostic line ratios.",2005-08-09T13:56:55Z
X-ray synchrotron emission from supernova remnants,"X-ray synchrotron emission tells us of the highest energy reached by
accelerated electrons. In a few supernova remnants (SN 1006, G347.3-0.5) this
is the dominant form of X-ray radiation, but in most it is superposed to the
dominant thermal emission. Thanks to the spectro-imaging capability of Chandra
and XMM-Newton, X-ray synchrotron emission has now been unambiguously detected
in most young supernova remnants (Cas A, Tycho, Kepler). It arises in a very
thin shell (a few arcsecs) at the blast wave. The thinness of that shell (much
broader in the radio domain) implies that the high energy electrons cool down
very fast behind the shock. The magnetic field that one deduces from that
constraint is more than 100 muG behind the shock.",2005-03-15T09:28:23Z
"Searching for the Sources Responsible for Cosmic Reionization: Probing 7
  < z < 10 and Beyond","(Abridged) We review recent observations that suggest the star formation rate
density is declining over 3$<z<$7 and illustrate the challenges that this poses
in explaining the assembled stellar mass in z$\sim$6 galaxies deduced from
Spitzer data. A plausible conclusion is a vigorous period of earlier star
formation. Prior to JWST and TMT, strong lensing offers a unique probe of the
extent of this earlier activity. We discuss the first results of a blind
spectroscopic survey of lensing clusters for 8.5$<z<$10 Ly$\alpha$ emitters
using NIRSPEC which is achieving a limiting star formation rate of 0.1
$M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. A companion HST/IRAC survey is targeting lensed $z$ and
$J$-band dropouts and probes a $\simeq$1 arcmin$^2$ region 1 magnitude deeper
than the UDF/NICMOS observations. Both surveys will constrain the contribution
of early, low luminosity, sources to cosmic reionization.",2005-08-04T06:13:45Z
"The stability of MHD Taylor-Couette flow with current-free spiral
  magnetic fields between conducting cylinders","We study the magnetorotational instability in cylindrical Taylor-Couette
flow, with the (vertically unbounded) cylinders taken to be perfect conductors,
and with externally imposed spiral magnetic fields. The azimuthal component of
this field is generated by an axial current inside the inner cylinder, and may
be slightly stronger than the axial field. We obtain an instability beyond the
Rayleigh line, for Reynolds numbers of order 1000 and Hartmann numbers of order
10, and independent of the (small) magnetic Prandtl number. For experiments
with R_out = 2 R_in = 10 cm and Omega_out = 0.27 Omega_in, the instability
appears for liquid sodium for axial fields of ~20 Gauss and axial currents of
\~1200 A. For gallium the numbers are ~50 Gauss and ~3200 A. The vertical cell
size is about twice the cell size known for nonmagnetic experiments.",2005-07-06T08:48:28Z
"X-Ray Observations of the Black Hole Transient 4U 1630-47 During Two
  Years of X-Ray Activity","The black hole candidate (BHC) X-ray transient 4U 1630-47 continuously
produced strong X-ray emission for over 2 years during 2002-2004. We use
observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) to study the
source throughout the outburst along with hard X-ray images from the
INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL). The source exhibits
extreme behaviors, including measured inner disk temperatures (Tin) between 2.7
and 3.8 keV, which are only rivaled by the brightest BHC systems. If the high
temperatures are caused by the dominance of electron scattering opacity in the
inner regions of the accretion disk, a luminosity >20% of the Eddington limit
is theoretically required. We detect several types of variability, including
hard 10-100 s flares at the highest disk luminosities in a regime where the
source deviates from the Ldisk/Tin relationship that is seen at lower
luminosities, possibly suggesting that we are seeing transitions between a
standard disk and a ""slim"" disk. The X-ray properties in 2002-2004 are
significantly different from those seen during the 1998 outburst, which is the
only outburst with detected radio jet emission. Our results support the
""jet-line"" concept recently advanced by Fender and co-workers. Our study allows
for a test of the quantitative McClintock & Remillard spectral state
definitions. We also report on detections of the nearby sources IGR J16320-4751
and IGR J16358-4726.",2005-05-12T22:12:15Z
The high-velocity clouds and the Magellanic Clouds,"From an analysis of the sky and velocity distributions of the high-velocity
clouds (HVCs) we show that the majority of the HVCs has a common origin. We
conclude that the HVCs surround the Galaxy, forming a metacloud of 300 kpc in
size and with a mass of 3 10^9 M_sun, and that they are the product of a
powerful ``superwind'' (about 10^58 ergs), which occurred in the Magellanic
Clouds about 570 Myr ago as a consequence of the interaction of the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds. The HVCs might be magnetic bubbles of semi-ionized
gas, blown from the Magellanic Clouds around 570 Myr ago, that circulate
largely through the halo of the Galaxy as a stream or flow of gas.",2005-05-31T23:01:16Z
"The Properties of Intergalactic C IV and Si IV Absorption, I: Optimal
  Analysis of an Extremely High S/N Quasar Sample","We have analyzed the properties of metals in the high redshift intergalactic
medium using a novel objective pixel optical depth technique on a sample of
extremely high signal-to-noise Keck HIRES and ESI spectra of 26 quasars between
redshifts 2.1 and 6.4. The technique relies on using the doublet nature of the
common ions CIV and SiIV that are the principal metal tracers in the
intergalactic medium outside of the Ly alpha forest. Optical depths are
statistically corrected for contamination by other lines, telluric absorption,
bad pixels, continuum fitting, etc. and for incompleteness, and we achieve in
this way an increased sensitivity of approximately 0.5 dex over previous
analyses. Unlike existing POD techniques, we do not compare the ion optical
depths with HI optical depths; we therefore avoid problems arising from
different velocity widths in the ion and HI. We have shown how the conventional
analysis can be reproduced using a percolation method to generate pseudo-clouds
from ion optical depths. We find that for the higher resolution HIRES data
there is a tight relation, tau ~ N^{0.7}, between the peak optical depth and
the column density. From the optical depth vectors themselves we show that
there is little evolution in the total amount of CIV from z = 2 to z = 5,
though there is a turndown of at least a factor of two in Omega(CIV) above z =
5. We do, however, see substantial evolution in the ratio, SiIV/CIV. Two
subsequent papers will investigate what fraction of the absorbers lie in
galatic wind outflows (Paper II) and what metallicity is associated with
regions of tau(Ly alpha) < 1 (Paper III).",2005-07-27T20:31:56Z
"Internal Alignment of the Halos of Disk Galaxies in Cosmological
  Hydrodynamic Simulations","Seven cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of disk galaxy formation are
analyzed to determine the alignment of the disk within the dark matter halo and
the internal structure of the halo. We find that the orientation of the outer
halo, beyond ~0.1 r_vir, is unaffected by the presence of the disk. In
contrast, the inner halo is aligned such that the halo minor axis aligns with
the disk axis. The relative orientation of these two regions of the halo are
uncorrelated. The alignment of the disk and inner halo appears to take place
simultaneously through their joint evolution. The disconnect between these two
regions of the halo should be taken into account when modelling tidal streams
in the halos of disk galaxies and when calculating intrinsic alignments of disk
galaxies based on the properties of dark matter halos.",2005-05-26T00:43:40Z
MERLIN monitoring of recent core-collapse supernovae,"The star formation rate (SFR) in starburst galaxies can be measured by many
methods, one of which is through the supernova rate. Due to the heavy dust
obscuration in these galaxies, searches for new supernovae in the optical or
infra-red can easily miss events occurring in the central starburst regions. As
part of a long term program to estimate the SFR in a sample of nearby
starbursts we are using MERLIN and the VLA to regularly observe the galaxies
for new radio supernovae. As part of this project, regular MERLIN observations
have been made of two recent optically bright supernovae: 2004dj and 2004et.
Both supernovae are of Type II and have been monitored frequently over periods
of a few months, resulting in well sampled radio ""light"" curves for both
objects.",2005-05-24T13:00:31Z
"Broad-band electromagnetic radiation from microquasars interacting with
  ISM","Microquasars (MQs) are galactic objects with relativistic jets that
constitute a source population which can be responsible for production of a
non-negligible fraction of the observed galactic cosmic rays. These
relativistic protons, associated with the termination of the jet, interact with
the interstellar medium and, at certain surrounding conditions, may lead to
production of detectable fluxes of high-energy and very high-energy gamma-rays.
This radiation is accompanied by the broad-band emission of secondary electrons
from decays of $\pi^\pm$-mesons produced through synchrotron, bremstrahlung and
inverse Compton process. The features of broad-band emission initiated by
proton-proton (pp) interactions in such a scenario is discussed in the context
of the strategy of search for counterparts of high-energy and very high-energy
gamma-ray sources in the galactic plane.",2005-07-18T14:43:49Z
"The NN2 Flux Difference Method for Constructing Variable Object Light
  Curves","We present a new method for optimally extracting point-source time
variability information from a series of images. Differential photometry is
generally best accomplished by subtracting two images separated in time, since
this removes all constant objects in the field. By removing background sources
such as the host galaxies of supernovae, such subtractions make possible the
measurement of the proper flux of point-source objects superimposed on extended
sources. In traditional difference photometry, a single image is designated as
the ``template'' image and subtracted from all other observations. This
procedure does not take all the available information into account and for
sub-optimal template images may produce poor results. Given N total
observations of an object, we show how to obtain an estimate of the vector of
fluxes from the individual images using the antisymmetric matrix of flux
differences formed from the N(N-1)/2 distinct possible subtractions and provide
a prescription for estimating the associated uncertainties. We then demonstrate
how this method improves results over the standard procedure of designating one
image as a ``template'' and differencing against only that image.",2005-07-25T20:03:58Z
Dwarf spheroidal galaxies in nearby groups imaged with HST,"An all-sky list of 88 nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies with distances
D < 10 Mpc is considered. Most of the objects have recently been found by
Karachentseva & Karachentsev based on POSSII/ESO-SERC survey. A hundred more
dSph galaxies are expected in this volume, being missed so far because of their
low luminosity and low surface brightness. Apart from 22 dSph members of the
Local Group, there are 33 dSphs in other nearby groups that have been resolved
recently into stars with HST. Only 5% of the local dSphs are situated outside
the known groups. We discuss observational correlation between basic parameters
of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, in particular, absolute magnitude, surface
brightness, metallicity, and so-called ""tidal index"". The observed number of
dSphs in group increases with luminosity of its brightest galaxy. In a
""synthetic"" nearby group, dwarf spheroidal galaxies are distributed in depth
quite symmetrically about the principal galaxy, having an rms distance scatter
of 200 kpc. Projected radial distribution of dSphs in the synthetic group
follows the profile N(R) ~ exp(-R/200 kpc).",2005-04-15T06:49:22Z
Large non-Gaussianity in multiple-field inflation,"We investigate non-Gaussianity in general multiple-field inflation using the
formalism we developed in earlier papers. We use a perturbative expansion of
the non-linear equations to calculate the three-point correlator of the
curvature perturbation analytically. We derive a general expression that
involves only a time integral over background and linear perturbation
quantities. We work out this expression explicitly for the two-field slow-roll
case, and find that non-Gaussianity can be orders of magnitude larger than in
the single-field case. In particular, the bispectrum divided by the square of
the power spectrum can easily be of O(1-10), depending on the model. Our result
also shows the explicit momentum dependence of the bispectrum. This conclusion
of large non-Gaussianity is confirmed in a semi-analytic slow-roll
investigation of a simple quadratic two-field model.",2005-06-28T19:56:40Z
"Influence of local treatments of convection upon solar p mode excitation
  rates","We compute the rates P at which acoustic energy is injected into the solar
radial p modes for several solar models. The solar models are computed with two
different local treatments of convection: the classical mixing-length theory
(MLT hereafter) and Canuto et al (1996)'s formulation (CGM hereafter). Among
the models investigated here, our best models reproduce both the solar radius
and the solar luminosity at solar age and the observed Balmer line profiles.
For the MLT treatment, the rates P do depend significantly on the properties of
the atmosphere whereas for the CGM's treatment the dependence of P on the
properties of the atmosphere is found smaller than the error bars attached to
the seismic measurements. The excitation rates P for modes associated with the
MLT models are significantly underestimated compared with the solar seismic
constraints. The CGM models yield values for P closer to the seismic data than
the MLT models. We conclude that the solar p-mode excitation rates provide
valuable constraints and according to the present investigation clearly favor
the CGM treatment with respect to the MLT, although neither of them yields
values of P as close to the observations as recently found for 3D numerical
simulations.",2005-07-11T09:51:30Z
Number counts in homogeneous and inhomogeneous dark energy models,"In the simple case of a constant equation of state, redshift distribution of
collapsed structures may constrain dark energy models. Different dark energy
models having the same energy density today but different equations of state
give quite different number counts. Moreover, we show that introducing the
possibility that dark energy collapses with dark matter (``inhomogeneous'' dark
energy) significantly complicates the picture. We illustrate our results by
comparing four dark energy models to the standard $\Lambda$-model. We
investigate a model with a constant equation of state equal to -0.8, a phantom
energy model and two scalar potentials (built out of a combination of two
exponential terms). Although their equations of state at present are almost
indistinguishable from a $\Lambda$-model, both scalar potentials undergo quite
different evolutions at higher redshifts and give different number counts. We
show that phantom dark energy induces opposite departures from the
$\Lambda$-model as compared with the other models considered here. Finally, we
find that inhomogeneous dark energy enhances departures from the
$\Lambda$-model with maximum deviations of about 15% for both number counts and
integrated number counts. Larger departures from the $\Lambda$-model are
obtained for massive structures which are rare objects making it difficult to
statistically distinguish between models.",2005-06-02T02:46:20Z
"Comparison of UHE Composition Measurements by Fly's Eye,
  HiRes-prototype/MIA and Stereo HiRes Experiments","We compare the elongation rate and Xmax distributions for three
air-fluorescence experiments: Stereo Fly's Eye, HiRes/MIA, and HiRes. A shift
of 13 gm/cm^3 of the stereo Fly's Eye data, well within the quoted systematic
errors, brings the elongation rates and the Xmax distributions of all three
experiments into reasonable agreement. We explore the implications of this
combined dataset ranging from 10^17 eV to near 10^20 eV.",2005-07-20T17:45:36Z
PHASES High Precision Differential Astrometry of delta Equulei,"delta Equulei is among the most well-studied nearby binary star systems.
Results of its observation have been applied to a wide range of fundamental
studies of binary systems and stellar astrophysics. It is widely used to
calibrate and constrain theoretical models of the physics of stars. We report
27 high precision differential astrometry measurements of delta Equulei from
the Palomar High-precision Astrometric Search for Exoplanet Systems (PHASES).
The median size of the minor axes of the uncertainty ellipses for these
measurements is 26 micro-arcseconds. These data are combined with previously
published radial velocity data and other previously published differential
astrometry measurements using other techniques to produce a combined model for
the system orbit. The distance to the system is determined to within a
twentieth of a parsec and the component masses are determined at the level of a
percent. The constraints on masses and distance are limited by the precisions
of the radial velocity data; we outline plans improve this deficiency and
discuss the outlook for further study of this binary.",2005-07-25T21:10:12Z
Two Body Relaxation in Simulated Cosmological Haloes,"This paper aims at quantifying discreetness effects, born of finite particle
number, on the dynamics of dark matter haloes forming in the context of
cosmological simulations. By generalising the standard calculation of two body
relaxation to the case when the size and mass distribution are variable, and
parametrising the time evolution using established empirical relations, we find
that the dynamics of a million particle halo is noise-dominated within the
inner percent of the final virial radius. Far larger particle numbers (~ 10^8)
are required for the RMS perturbations to the velocity to drop to the 10 %
level there. The radial scaling of the relaxation time is simple and strong:
t_relax ~ r^2, implying that numbers >> 10^8 are required to faithfully model
the very inner regions; artificial relaxation may thus constitute an important
factor, contributing to the contradictory claims concerning the persistence of
a power law density cusp to the very centre. The cores of substructure haloes
can be many relaxation times old. Since relaxation first causes their expansion
before recontraction occurs, it may render them either more difficult or easier
to disrupt, depending on their orbital parameters. It may thus modify the
characteristics of the subhalo distribution and effects of interactions with
the parent. We derive simple closed form formulas for the characteristic
relaxation times, as well as for the weak N-scaling reported by Diemand et al.
when the main contribution comes from relaxing subhaloes (abridged).",2005-06-25T00:22:31Z
"The Monopole Moment of the Three-Point Correlation Function of the
  2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey","We measure the monopole moment of the three-point correlation function on
scales $1\mpc-70\mpc$ in the Two degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS).
Volume limited samples are constructed using a series of integral magnitudes
bins between $M = -18 ... -22$. Our measurements with a novel edge-corrected
estimator represent most, if not all, three-point level monopole or angular
averaged information in the catalogue. We fit a perturbative non-linear bias
model to a joint data vector formed from the estimated two- and three-point
correlation functions. Two different models are used: an analytic model based
on Eulerian perturbation theory including bias and redshift distortions, and a
phenomenological bias model based on the direct redshift space measurements in
the large Virgo simulations. To interpret the clustering results, we perform a
three parameter Gaussian maximum likelihood analysis. In the canonical $-21
\sim -20$ volume limited sample we find $\sigma_8 = 0.93^{+0.06}_{-0.2}$, $b =
1.04^{+0.23}_{-0.09}$, and $b_2 = -0.06^{+0.003}_{-0.001}$. Our estimate of
$\sigma_8$, is robust across the different volume limited samples constructed.
These results, based solely on the large scale clustering of galaxies, are in
excellent agreement with previous analyses using the Wilkinson Anisotropy
Probe: this is a spectacular success of the concordance model. We also present
two-parameter fits for the bias parameters, which are in excellent agreement
with previous findings of the bias evolution in the 2dFGRS.",2005-05-19T21:00:46Z
"Topology Analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: I. Scale and
  Luminosity Dependences","We measure the topology of volume-limited galaxy samples selected from a
parent sample of 314,050 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS), which
is now complete enough to describe the fully three-dimensional topology and its
dependence on galaxy properties. We compare the observed genus statistic
G\nu_f) to predictions for a Gaussian random field and to the genus measured
for mock surveys constructed from new large-volume simulations of the LambdaCDM
cosmology. In this analysis we carefully examine the dependence of the observed
genus statistic on the Gaussian smoothing scale R_G from 3.5 to 11 h^-1Mpc and
on the luminosity of galaxies over the range -22.50<M_r<-18.5. The void
multiplicity A_V is less than unity at all smoothing scales. Because A_V cannot
become less than 1 through gravitational evolution, this result provides strong
evidence for biased galaxy formation in low density environments. We also find
clear evidence of luminosity bias of topology within the volume-limited
sub-samples. The shift parameter Delta nu indicates that the genus of brighter
galaxies shows a negative shift toward a ``meatball'' (i.e. cluster-dominated)
topology, while faint galaxies show a positive shift toward a ``bubble'' (i.e.
void-dominated) topology. The transition from negative to positive shift occurs
approximately at the characteristic absolute magnitude M_{r*}=-20.4. Even in
this analysis of the largest galaxy sample to date, we detect the influence of
individual large-scale structures, as the shift parameter Delta nu and cluster
multiplicity A_C reflect (at ~3 sigma) the presence of the Sloan Great Wall and
a X-shaped structure which runs for several hundred Mpc across the survey
volume.",2005-07-04T09:36:14Z
"First Ultraviolet Spectrum of a Brown Dwarf: Evidence for H_2
  Fluorescence and Accretion","We analyze an HST/STIS ultraviolet spectrum of the young brown dwarf 2MASSW
J1207334-393254, a member of the ten million-year old TW Hya Association that
has a planetary-mass companion. We detect and identify numerous emission lines.
CIV and other ions are seen that arise in hot gas. We identify a series of
lines with Lyman-pumped H_2 molecular lines, indicating that cool gas is also
present. Overall, this substellar object shows many of the same characteristics
as classical T Tauri stars. We interpret our results as direct evidence of
accretion from a circumstellar gas disk, consistent with previous claims. The
lack of SiIV emission from the accreting gas indicates that silicon has been
depleted into grains.",2005-07-19T04:37:59Z
"Evolution of protoplanetary disks: Constraints from DM Tauri and GM
  Aurigae","We present a one-dimensional model of the formation and viscous evolution of
protoplanetary disks. The formation of the early disk is modeled as the result
of the gravitational collapse of an isothermal molecular cloud. The disk's
viscous evolution is integrated according to two parameterizations of
turbulence: The classical $\alpha$ representation and a $\beta$
parameterization, representative of non-linear turbulence driven by the
keplerian shear. We apply the model to DM Tau and GM Aur, two classical T-Tauri
stars with relatively well-characterized disks, retrieving the evolution of
their surface density with time. We perform a systematic Monte-Carlo
exploration of the parameter space (i.e. values of the $\alpha$-$\beta$
parameters, and of the temperature and rotation rate in the molecular cloud) to
find the values that are compatible with the observed disk surface density
distribution, star and disk mass, age and present accretion rate. We find that
the observations for DM Tau require $0.001<\alpha<0.1$ or $2\times
10^{-5}<\beta<5\times 10^{-4}$. For GM Aur, we find that the turbulent
viscosity is such that $4\times 10^{-4}<\alpha<0.01$ or $2\times
10^{-6}<\beta<8\times 10^{-5}$. These relatively large values show that an
efficient turbulent diffusion mechanism is present at distances larger than
$\sim 10 $AU. This is to be compared to studies of the variations of accretion
rates of T-Tauri stars versus age that mostly probe the inner disks, but also
yield values of $\alpha\sim 0.01$. We show that the mechanism responsible for
turbulent diffusion at large orbital distances most probably cannot be
convection because of its suppression at low optical depths.",2005-06-21T15:16:19Z
"Constraints from the Detection of Cosmic Topology on the Generalized
  Chaplygin Gas","Despite our present-day inability to predict the topology of the universe one
may expect that we should be able to detect it in the near future, given the
increasing accuracy in the astro-cosmological observations. Motivated by this,
we examine to what extent a possible detection of a non-trivial topology of a
low curvature (Omega_0 ~ 1) universe, suggested by a diverse set of current
observations, may be used to place constraints on the matter content of the
universe, focusing our attention on the generalized Chaplgygin gas (GCG) model,
which unifies dark matter and dark energy in a single matter component. We show
that besides constraining the GCG free parameters, the detection of a
nontrivial topology also allows to set bounds on the total density parameter
Omega_0. We also study the combination of the bounds from the topology
detection with the limits that arise from current data on 194 SNIa, and show
that the determination of a given nontrivial topology sets complementary bounds
on the GCG parameters (and on Omega_0) to those obtained from the SNIa data.",2005-07-05T23:37:35Z
Chandra Observations of Shock Kinematics in Supernova Remnant 1987A,"We report the first results from deep X-ray observations of the SNR 1987A
with the Chandra LETG. Temperatures inferred from line ratios range from 0.1 -
2 keV and increase with ionization potential. Expansion velocities inferred
from X-ray line profiles range from 300 - 1700 km/s, much less than the
velocities inferred from the radial expansion of the radio and X-ray images. We
can account for these observations with a scenario in which the X-rays are
emitted by shocks produced where the supernova blast wave strikes dense
protrusions of the inner circumstellar ring, which are also responsible for the
optical hot spots.",2005-06-19T23:12:45Z
Quantitative Spectroscopy of Photospheric-Phase Type II Supernovae,"We present first results on the quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the
photospheric-phase of Type II supernovae (SN). The analyses are based on the
non-LTE model atmosphere code, CMFGEN, of Hillier & Miller (1998). A key asset
of CMFGEN is its thorough treatment of line-blanketing due to metal species.
  From its applicability to hot star environments, the main modifications to
the source code were to allow a linear velocity law, a power-law density
distribution, an adaptive grid to handle the steep H recombination/ionization
front occurring in cooler SN models, and a routine to compute the gray
temperature structure in the presence of large velocities. In this first paper
we demonstrate the ability of CMFGEN to reproduce, with a high level of
accuracy, the UV and optical observations of a sample of well observed Type II
SN, i.e. SN1987A and SN1999em, at representative stages of their photospheric
evolution. Two principal stages of SN are modeled - that where hydrogen is
fully ionized, and that in which H is only partially ionized. We provide
detailed and accurate line identifications for our sample of epochs. We discuss
the impact on the SED of varying the density exponent, the spatial scale of the
SN, the value of Rmax and the metallicity; we illustrate the formation sites
for selected lines. Both Hydrogen Balmer and Helium lines (when present) are
very well reproduced, even for our adopted CNO-equilibrium abundance values
adequate for a massive supergiant progenitor star. NII lines are also predicted
in the blue-wing of both Hbeta and HeI 5875A, and thus not associated with
peculiar absorption/emission far above the photosphere. We finally present a
pedagogical discussion of P-Cygni profile formation and explain, e.g., the
noticeable blue-shift of Halpha in early time spectra (much abridged abstract).",2005-04-01T17:00:52Z
Foreground and Source of a Cluster of Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Rays,"We investigate the origin of a nearly pointlike cluster of 5 ultrahigh energy
cosmic rays at RA ~169.2deg and dec ~56.8deg, using Sloan Digital Sky Survey
and other data. No particular source candidates are found near the estimated
source direction, but the direction is exceptional in having a likely merging
pair of galaxy clusters at 140/h Mpc, with an unusually low foreground density.
Large scale shocks or another product of the merging galaxy clusters may
accelerate the UHECRs, or the merging galaxy clusters may be coincidental and
the UHECRs may be accelerated in a rare event of an unexceptional progenitor.
Low magnetic deflections in the foreground void may explain why this is the
only identified pointlike cluster of so many UHECRs.",2005-07-28T02:37:05Z
The Lyman-alpha forest as a probe of fundamental physics,"We use LUQAS, a sample of 27 high resolution high signal-to-noise UVES quasar
(QSO) spectra (Kim et al. 2004), and the Croft et al. (2002) sample together
with a set of high resolution large box size hydro-dynamical simulations run
with the code GADGET-II to recover the linear dark matter power spectrum at z>2
and at scales of 1-40 Mpc/h. These scales cannot be probed by any other
observable. We address some of the uncertainties in the theoretical modelling
of the Lyman-alpha forest structures such as the difference between full
hydro-dynamical simulations and a more simplified scheme based on the HPM
(Hydro-Particle-Mesh) technique. We combine these data sets with the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) data of WMAP in order to get tighter constraints on
cosmological parameters. We focus on the recovered values of the power spectrum
amplitude, the primordial spectral index and the running of the primordial
spectral index. By considering models of slow-roll inflation we give
constraints on inflationary parameters. We explore implications for the mass of
a warm dark matter particle, including light gravitinos and sterile neutrinos,
and the perspectives of constraining the neutrino mass.",2005-04-28T18:25:29Z
"On making predictions in a multiverse: conundrums, dangers, and

answer to the question of ""why is the universe so hospitable to life?"" This

string/M theory. But how do we test such a ""multiverse"" theory: which of the
many universes do we compare to ours? This paper enumerates would would seem to
be essential ingredients for making testable predictions, outlines different
strategies one might take within this framework, then discusses some of the
difficulties and dangers inherent in these approaches. Finally, I address the

multiverse theories might share.",2005-06-22T00:20:27Z
"A Burst and Simultaneous Short-Term Pulsed Flux Enhancement from the
  Magnetar Candidate 1E 1048.1-5937","We report on the 2004 June 29 burst detected from the direction of the
Anomalous X-ray Pulsar (AXP) 1E 1048.1-5937 using the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE). We find a simultaneous increase of ~3.5 times the quiescent
value in the 2-10 keV pulsed flux of 1E 1048.1-5937 during the tail of the
burst which identifies the AXP as the burst's origin. The burst was overall
very similar to the two others reported from the direction of this source in
2001. The unambiguous identification of 1E 1048.1-5937 as the burster here
confirms it was the origin of the 2001 bursts as well. The epoch of the burst
peak was very close to the arrival time of 1E 1048.1-5937's pulse peak. The
burst exhibited significant spectral evolution with the trend going from hard
to soft. During the 11 days following the burst, the AXP was observed further
with RXTE, XMM-Newton and Chandra. Pre- and post-burst observations revealed no
change in the total flux or spectrum of the quiescent emission. Comparing all
three bursts detected thus far from this source we find that this event was the
most fluent (>3.3x10^-8 erg/cm^2 in the 2-20 keV band), had the highest peak
flux (59+/-9x10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 2-20 keV band), and the longest duration
(>699 s). The long duration of the burst differentiates it from Soft Gamma
Repeater (SGR) bursts which have typical durations of ~0.1 s. Bursts that occur
preferentially at pulse maximum, have fast-rises and long X-tails containing
the majority of the total burst energy have been seen uniquely from AXPs. The
marked differences between AXP and SGRs bursts may provide new clues to help
understand the physical differences between these objects.",2005-07-02T03:33:58Z
"A Statistical Study of Threshold Rotation Rates for the Formation of
  Disks around Be Stars","This paper presents a detailed statistical determination of the equatorial
rotation rates of classical Be stars. The rapid rotation of Be stars is likely
to be linked to the ejection of gas that forms dense circumstellar disks. The
physical origins of these disks are not understood, though it is generally
believed that the ability to spin up matter into a Keplerian disk depends on
how close the stellar rotation speed is to the critical speed at which the
centrifugal force cancels gravity. There has been recent disagreement between
the traditional idea that Be stars rotate between 50 and 80 percent of their
critical speeds and new ideas (inspired by the tendency for gravity darkening
to mask rapid rotation at the equator) that their rotation may be very nearly
critical. This paper utilizes Monte Carlo forward modeling to simulate
distributions of the projected rotation speed (v sin i), taking into account
gravity darkening, limb darkening, and observational uncertainties. A
chi-squared minimization procedure was used to find the distribution parameters
that best reproduce observed v sin i distributions from R. Yudin's database.
Early-type (O7e-B2e) Be stars were found to exhibit a roughly uniform spread of
intrinsic rotation speed that extends from 40 to 60 percent up to 100 percent
of critical. Late-type (B3e-A0e) Be stars exhibit progressively narrower ranges
of rotation speed as the effective temperature decreases; the lower limit rises
to reach critical rotation for the coolest Be stars. The derived lower limits
on equatorial rotation speed represent conservative threshold rotation rates
for the onset of the Be phenomenon. The significantly subcritical speeds found
for early-type Be stars represent strong constraints on physical models of
angular momentum deposition in Be star disks.",2005-07-29T19:41:00Z

Acceleration of Plasma Flows Due to Reverse Dynamo Mechanism,"The ""reverse-dynamo"" mechanism - the amplification/generation of fast plasma

Energy-dependent variability from accretion flows,"We develop a formalism to calculate energy-dependent fractional variability
(rms) in accretion flows. We consider rms spectra resulting from radial
dependencies of the level of local variability (as expected from propagation of
disturbances in accretion flows) assuming the constant shape of the spectrum
emitted at a given radius. We consider the cases when the variability of the
flow is either coherent or incoherent between different radial zones. As
example local emission, we consider blackbody, Wien and thermal Comptonization
spectra. In addition to numerical results, we present a number of analytical
formulae for the resulting rms. We also find an analytical formula for the disc
Wien spectrum, which we find to be a very good approximation to the disc
blackbody. We compare our results to the rms spectrum observed in an ultrasoft
state of GRS 1915+105.",2005-04-12T15:49:29Z
"The HIPASS Catalogue: III - Optical Counterparts & Isolated Dark
  Galaxies","We present the largest catalogue to date of optical counterparts for HI
radio-selected galaxies, Hopcat. Of the 4315 HI radio-detected sources from the
HI Parkes All Sky Survey (Hipass) catalogue, we find optical counterparts for
3618 (84%) galaxies. Of these, 1798 (42%) have confirmed optical velocities and
848 (20%) are single matches without confirmed velocities. Some galaxy matches
are members of galaxy groups. From these multiple galaxy matches, 714 (16%)
have confirmed optical velocities and a further 258 (6%) galaxies are without
confirmed velocities. For 481 (11%), multiple galaxies are present but no
single optical counterpart can be chosen and 216 (5%) have no obvious optical
galaxy present. Most of these 'blank fields' are in crowded fields along the
Galactic plane or have high extinctions.
  Isolated 'Dark galaxy' candidates are investigated using an extinction cut of
ABj < 1 mag and the blank fields category. Of the 3692 galaxies with an ABj
extinction < 1 mag, only 13 are also blank fields. Of these, 12 are eliminated
either with follow-up Parkes observations or are in crowded fields. The
remaining one has a low surface brightness optical counterpart. Hence, no

Galactic Centre stellar winds and Sgr A* accretion,"(ABRIDGED) We present in detail our new 3D numerical models for the accretion
of stellar winds on to Sgr A*. In our most sophisticated models, we put stars
on realistic orbits around Sgr A*, include `slow' winds (300 km/s), and account
for radiative cooling. We first model only one phase `fast' stellar winds (1000
km/s). For wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is Mdot ~ 1e-5
Msun/yr, fluctuates by < 10%, and is in a good agreement with previous models.
In contrast, Mdot decreases by an order of magnitude for stars following
circular orbits, and fluctuates by ~ 50%. Then we allow a fraction of stars to
produce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively, forming cold clumps
immersed into the X-ray emitting gas. We test two orbital configurations for
the stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs
with perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive
to the orbits. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, with an
almost constant Mdot ~ 3e-6 Msun/yr, consistent with Chandra observations. The
cold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful episodes which may give
rise to large amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time scales
of 10s to 100s of years. The circularisation radii for the flows are ~ 1e3 and
1e4 Rsch, for the one and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never
forming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work.
Our work suggests that, averaged over time scales of 100s to 1000s of years,
the radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher
than it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion
modelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the
wind properties and stellar orbits.",2005-05-18T17:06:44Z
Grain Evolution across the Shocks in the L1448-mm Outflow,"The recent detection of shock-precursors toward the very young L1448-mm
outflow offers us the possibility to study the grain chemistry during the first
stages of the shock evolution, constraining the molecules ejected from grains
and the species formed in gas phase. Observations of key molecules in the grain
chemistry such as SiO, CH3OH, SO, CS, H2S, OCS, and SO2 toward this outflow are
presented. The line profiles and the derived abundances show three distinct
velocity regimes that trace the shock evolution: the preshock, the
shock-precursor and the postshock gas. The SiO, CH3OH, SO, and CS abundances
are enhanced with respect to the quiescent gas by 1 order of magnitude in the
shock-precursor component, and by 3 orders of magnitude in the postshock gas.
The derived SiO and CH3OH abundances are consistent with the recent ejection of
these molecules from grains. Since H2S is only enhanced in the shock-precursor
component, and OCS and SO2 are undetected, SO and CS are the most abundant
sulfur-bearing species in the grain mantles of L1448-mm. The ejection of mainly
SO and CS rather than H2S or OCS from grains, suggests that the sulfur
chemistry will depend on the chemical ""history"" of the grain mantles in
outflows and hot cores.",2005-06-17T11:21:15Z
Lithium and Lithium Depletion in Halo Stars on Extreme Orbits,"We have determined Li abundances in 55 metal-poor (3.6 < [Fe/H] < -0.7) stars
with extreme orbital kinematics. We find the Li abundance in the Li-plateau
stars and examine its decrease in low-temperature, low-mass stars. The Li
observations are primarily from the Keck I telescope with HIRES (spectral
resolution of ~48,000 and median signal-to-noise per pixel of 140). Abundances
or upper limits were determined for Li for all the stars with typical errors of
0.06 dex. Our 14 stars on the Li plateau give A(Li) = log N(Li)/N(H) + 12.00 of
2.215 +-0.110, consistent with earlier results. We find a dependence of the Li
abundance on metallicity as measured by [Fe/H] and the Fe-peak elements [Cr/H]
and [Ni/H], with a slope of ~0.18. We also find dependences of A(Li) with the
alpha elements, Mg, Ca, and Ti. For the n-capture element, Ba, the relation
between A(Li) and [Ba/H] has a shallower slope of 0.13; over a range of 2.6 dex
in [Ba/H], the Li abundance spans only a factor of two. We examined the
possible trends of A(Li) with the characteristics of the orbits of our halo
stars, but find no relationship with kinematic or dynamic properties. The stars
cooler than the Li plateau are separated into three metallicity subsets. The
decrease in A(Li) sets in at hotter temperatures at high metallicities than at
low metallicities; this is in the opposite sense of the predictions for Li
depletion from standard and non-standard models.",2005-07-27T01:46:02Z
The application of slim disk models to ULX: the case of M33 X-8,"A comparative XMM-Newton archival data spectral study of the ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX) M33 X-8 has been performed by using both the standard disk
model and the newly developed slim disk models. The results of this analysis
tend to confirm the hypothesis that M33 X-8 is an X-ray binary with a
stellar-mass black hole accreting at super-Eddington rate.",2005-06-14T07:42:47Z
A Statistical Solar Flare Forecast Method,"A Bayesian approach to solar flare prediction has been developed, which uses
only the event statistics of flares already observed. The method is simple,
objective, and makes few ad hoc assumptions. It is argued that this approach
should be used to provide a baseline prediction for certain space weather
purposes, upon which other methods, incorporating additional information, can
improve. A practical implementation of the method for whole-Sun prediction of
Geostationary Observational Environment Satellite (GOES) events is described in
detail, and is demonstrated for 4 November 2003, the day of the largest
recorded GOES flare. A test of the method is described based on the historical
record of GOES events (1975-2003), and a detailed comparison is made with US
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predictions for
1987-2003. Although the NOAA forecasts incorporate a variety of other
information, the present method out-performs the NOAA method in predicting mean
numbers of event days, for both M-X and X events. Skill scores and other
measures show that the present method is slightly less accurate at predicting
M-X events than the NOAA method, but substantially more accurate at predicting
X events, which are important contributors to space weather.",2005-05-14T23:32:57Z
"On the Feasibility of Characterizing Lens Stars in Future Space-Based
  Microlensing Surveys","If a light-emitting star is responsible for a gravitational microlensing
event, the lens can be characterized by analyzing the blended light from the
lens. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of characterizing lenses by
using this method in future space-based lensing surveys. To judge the
feasibility of the method, we estimate the portions of events whose blended
flux F_b can be firmly noticed and most of it can be attributed to the lens by
carrying out detailed simulations of Galactic bulge lensing events considering
various blending sources, including the lens, background stars, and binary
companions to the lens and source. From this, it is estimated that among the
events to be detected from a survey using a 1 m space telescope, ~27% will have
blending fractions of F_b/F\geq 10% and the blended flux of half of these
events will be contaminated more than (F_b-F_L)/F_b=20% by the flux from
blending sources other than the lens, implying the contamination of the blended
flux will be substantial. Although the contamination by the background stars
can be reduced by using an instrument with a higher resolution, it is estimated
that the blended flux of more than 1/3 of events will still be contaminated
(mostly by binary companions) even using a telescope equivalent to the {\it
Hubble Space Telescope}, assuming 50% binary frequency. We, therefore, conclude
that caution and consideration of the blending contaminants are required in
applying the lens-light analysis method.",2005-07-04T07:05:23Z
Evolving Disks in Cold Dark Matter Cosmology,"Despite having entered the era of ""precision cosmology,"" the formation of
galaxies within the favored CDM cosmological paradigm remains problematic. By
relating our N-body/smooth particle hydro-dynamical simulation to an extensive
range of Galactic and extragalactic observations, we shed light on the
formation and evolution of the Milky Way and other late type galaxies. In light
of recent observations of the stellar populations of extragalactic thick disks,
we examine the proposal that the thick disk formed in a high redshift period
characterized by gas rich merging. We show such a scenario to be consistent
with color observations. We then follow the evolution of structural parameters
of the subsequently formed disk galaxy, from redshift ~1 to the present.
Consistent with observation, little evolution in the ratio of scale-height to
scale-length is found in our simulated galaxy, despite its somewhat chaotic
origins. The simulated galaxy in this report forms part of a larger study of a
suite of galaxies, with which these issues are to be studied in detail.",2005-03-15T19:10:50Z
Applying Machine Learning to Catalogue Matching in Astrophysics,"We present the results of applying automated machine learning techniques to
the problem of matching different object catalogues in astrophysics. In this
study we take two partially matched catalogues where one of the two catalogues
has a large positional uncertainty. The two catalogues we used here were taken
from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS), and SuperCOSMOS optical survey.
Previous work had matched 44% (1887 objects) of HIPASS to the SuperCOSMOS
catalogue.
  A supervised learning algorithm was then applied to construct a model of the
matched portion of our catalogue. Validation of the model shows that we
achieved a good classification performance (99.12% correct).
  Applying this model, to the unmatched portion of the catalogue found 1209 new
matches. This increases the catalogue size from 1887 matched objects to 3096.
The combination of these procedures yields a catalogue that is 72% matched.",2005-04-01T06:42:54Z
"Theoretical Interpretation of the Measurements of the Secondary Eclipses
  of TrES-1 and HD209458b","We calculate the planet-star flux-density ratios as a function of wavelength
from 0.5 microns to 25 microns for the transiting extrasolar giant planets
TrES-1 and HD209458b and compare them with the recent Spitzer/IRAC-MIPS
secondary eclipse data in the 4.5, 8.0, and 24 micron bands. With only three
data points and generic calibration issues, detailed conclusions are difficult,
but inferences regarding atmospheric composition, temperature, and global
circulation can be made. Our models reproduce the observations reasonably well,
but not perfectly, and we speculate on the theoretical consequences of
variations around our baseline models. One preliminary conclusion is that we
may be seeing in the data indications that the day side of a close-in
extrasolar giant planet is brighter in the mid-infrared than its night side,
unlike Jupiter and Saturn. This correspondence will be further tested when the
data anticipated in other Spitzer bands are acquired, and we make predictions
for what those data may show.",2005-03-23T23:23:21Z
"Investigation of flat spectrum radio sources by the interplanetary
  scintillation method at 111 MHz","Interplanetary scintillation observations of 48 of the 55 Augusto et al.
(1998) flat spectrum radio sources were carried out at 111 MHz using the
interplanetary scintillation method on the Large Phased Array (LPA) in Russia.
Due to the large size of the LPA beam ($1\degr \times 0.5\degr$) a careful
inspection of all possible confusion sources was made using extant large radio
surveys: 37 of the 48 sources are not confused. We were able to estimate the
scintillating flux densities of 13 sources, getting upper limits for the
remaining 35. Gathering more or improving extant VLBI data on these sources
might significantly improve our results. This proof-of-concept project tells us
that compact ($<1''$) flat spectrum radio sources show strong enough
scintillations at 111 MHz to establish/constrain their spectra (low-frequency
end).",2005-07-12T10:34:45Z
Asteroids. From Observations to Models,"We will discuss some specific applications to the rotation state and the

Magnetic turbulence in cool cores of galaxy clusters,"We argue that the recently reported Kolmogorov-like magnetic turbulence
spectrum in the cool core of the Hydra A galaxy cluster can be understood by
kinetic energy injection by active galaxies that drives a turbulent non-helical
magnetic dynamo into its saturated state. Although dramatic differences exist
between small-scale dynamo scenarios, their saturated state is expected to be
similar, as we show for three scenarios: the flux rope dynamo, the fluctuation
dynamo, and the explosive dynamo. Based on those scenarios, we develop an
analytical model of the hydrodynamic and magnetic turbulence in cool cores. The
model implies magnetic field strengths that fit well with Faraday rotation
measurements and minimum energy estimates for the sample of cool core clusters
having such data available. Predictions for magnetic fields in clusters for
which the appropriate observational information is still missing, and for yet
unobserved quantities like the hydrodynamical turbulence velocity and
characteristic length-scale are provided. The underlying dynamo models suggest
magnetic intermittency and possibly a large-scale hydrodynamic viscosity. We
conclude that the success of the model to explain the field strength in cool
core clusters indicates that in general cluster magnetic fields directly
reflect hydrodynamical turbulence, also in clusters without cool cores.",2005-05-25T16:38:16Z
Silicate emissions in active galaxies - From LINERs to QSOs,"We report the first detection of ~10 and ~18 micron silicate dust emissions
in a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), obtained in Spitzer-IRS 7-37
micron spectroscopy of the Type 1 LINER galaxy NGC3998. Silicate emissions in
AGN have only recently been detected in several quasars. Our detection counters
suggestions that silicate emissions are present only in the most luminous AGN.
The silicate features may be signatures of a dusty ``obscuring torus'' viewed
face-on as postulated for Type 1 AGN. However, the apparently cool (~200 K)
dust is inconsistent with theoretical expectations of much hotter torus walls.
Furthermore, not all Type 1 objects are silicate emission sources.
Alternatively, the silicate emission may originate in dust not directly
associated with a torus. We find that the long-wavelength (>20 micron) tail of
the emission in NGC3998 is significantly weaker than in the sample of bright
QSOs recently presented by Hao et al. The 10 micron profile in our NGC3998
spectrum is inconsistent with ``standard'' silicate ISM dust. This may indicate
differences in the dust composition, grain size distribution, or degree of
crystallization. The differences between NGC3998, QSOs, and Galactic templates
suggest that there are significant environmental variations.",2005-06-29T08:04:48Z
Cold Dust in (Some) High z Supernova Host Galaxies,"We present deep submillimetre photometry for 14 galaxies at z=0.5 that are
hosts of type 1a supernovae, with the aim of examining the evolution of dust
mass and extinction in normal galaxies. We combine these results with our
previous observations of 17 z~0.5 SN1a hosts to look for any evolution in the
dust content of normal galaxies between z=0 and z=0.5. The average observed
frame 850micron flux of SN1a hosts in the full sample, excluding 2 bright
individually detected objects, is 0.44 +/- 0.22 mJy. This flux level is
consistent with there being little or no evolution in the dust content, or
optical extinction, of normal galaxies from z=0 to z=0.5. One galaxy, the host
of SN1996cf, is detected individually, and we also present a deep HST STIS
image for this object. It appears to be an edge on disk system, similar to the
submm bright host of SN1997ey. We thus examine the dust properties of these and
one other individually detected object. 450-to-850 micron flux ratios and
limits suggest that the dust in the two brightest submm sources, SN1996cf and
SN1997ey, is cold, T ~20K, implying that they contain a substantial mass of
dust ~10^9 Msun. The presence of two bright (F850 >7mJy) submm sources at z~0.5
in a sample of ostensibly normal galaxies is surprising, and has important
implications. It supports the idea that a substantial part of the Cosmic
Infrared Background (CIB) may be produced at z<1, while also suggesting that
'foreground' objects such as these may be a significant 'contaminant' in submm
surveys. Finally, we examine the overall submm luminosity distribution at z=0.5
implied by our results, and conclude that either there is substantial evolution
in the submm luminosity function from z=0 to 0.5, or our submm detected sources
are somehow not representative of the bulk of galaxies at this redshift.",2005-07-27T16:30:09Z
"X-Ray Spectra of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxy Ton S180 in Comparison
  with Galactic Black Holes","An analysis was made of 0.3-15 keV X-ray spectra of a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
Galaxy, Ton S180, using archival data from ASCA, RXTE, and XMM-Newton. At
energies above 2.5 keV, a power-law with a photon index of ~ 2.3 successfully
and consistently reproduced the spectra from all of these observatories.
Assuming this power-law component to extend toward lower energies, a soft
excess, which is one of the most remarkable features of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
Galaxies, is explained by another power-law multiplied by a thermal cutoff at ~
0.4 keV. Some similarities have been observed between this object and Galactic
black hole binaries in very high state, the latter being realized under high
accretion rates. Attempts have been made to interpret the soft excess in terms
of Comptonization of the disk photons by an electron cloud surrounding the
accretion disk, like BHBs in a very high state.",2005-04-05T09:17:32Z
High-Ionization Emission in Metal-Deficient Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxies,"Primordial stars are expected to be very massive and hot, producing copious
amounts of hard ionizing radiation. The best place to study hard ionizing
radiation in the local universe is in very metal-deficient Blue Compact Dwarf
(BCD) galaxies. We have carried out a MMT spectroscopic search for [Ne V] 3426
(ionization potential of 7.1 Ryd), [Fe V] 4227 (ionization potential of 4 Ryd)
and He II 4686 (ionization potential of 4 Ryd) emission in a sample of 18 BCDs.
We have added data from previous work and from the Data Release 3 of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. In total, we have assembled a BCD high-ionization sample
with [Ne V] emission in 4 galaxies, [Fe V] emission in 15 galaxies and He II
emission in 465 galaxies. With this large sample, we have reached the following
conclusions. There is a general trend of higher [Ne V], [Fe V] and He II
emission at lower metallicities. However metallicity is not the only factor
which controls the hardness of the radiation. High-mass X-ray binaries and
main-sequence stars are probably excluded as the main sources of the very hard
ionizing radiation responsible for [Ne V] emission. The most likely source of
[Ne V] emission is probably fast radiative shocks moving with velocities > 450
km/s through a dense interstellar medium with an electron number density of
several hundreds per cm^-3 and associated with supernova explosions of the most
massive stars. These have masses of ~ 50 - 100 Msun and are formed in very
compact super-star clusters. The softer ionizing radiation required for He II
emission is likely associated with less massive evolved stars and/or radiative
shocks moving through a less dense interstellar medium.",2005-07-08T15:20:48Z
The Baikal neutrino experiment: from NT200 to NT200+,"The Baikal neutrino telescope NT200 takes data since 1998. In 2005, the
deployment of three additional strings for common operation with NT200 was
finished. We describe the physics program and the design of the new telescope
named NT200+ and present selected physical results obtained with NT200. First
results from NT200+ will be presented at the conference.",2005-07-29T16:25:58Z
"Geometrical Effect of Supercritical Accretion Flows: Observational
  Implications of Galactic Black-Hole Candidates and Ultraluminous X-ray
  Sources","We investigate the dependence of the viewing angle in supercritical accretion
flows and discuss the observational implications of galactic black-hole
candidates and ultraluminous X-ray sources. When the mass accretion rate
exceeds the critical rate, then the shape of the disk is geometrically thick
due to the enhanced radiation pressure. The model spectra of supercritical
accretion flows strongly depend on the inclination angle. Because the outer
disk blocks the emission from the disk inner region for high inclination angle.
We also find that the spectral properties of low-inclination angle and low
accretion-rate disks are very similar to those of high-inclination and high
accretion rate disks. That is, if an object has a high inclination and high
accretion rate, such a system suffers from self-occultation and the spectrum
will be extremely soft. Therefore, we cannot discriminate these differences
from spectrum shapes only. Conversely, if we use the self-occultation
properties, we could constrain the inclination angle of the system. We suggest
that some observed high temperature ultraluminous X-ray sources have near
face-on geometry, i < 40, and Galactic black hole candidate, XTE J1550-564,
possesses relatively high-inclination angles, i > 60.",2005-04-08T01:34:42Z
"BIMA Array Detections of HCN in Comets LINEAR (C/2002 T7) and NEAT
  (C/2001 Q4)","We present interferometric detections of HCN in comets LINEAR (C/2002 T7) and
NEAT (C/2001 Q4) with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) Array.
With a 25.4""x20.3"" synthesized beam around Comet LINEAR and using a variable
temperature and outflow velocity (VTOV) model, we found an HCN column density
of N_T=6.4+-2.1x10^12 cm^-2, and a production rate of Q(HCN)=6.5+-2.2x10^26
s^-1, giving a production rate ratio of HCN relative to H_2O of ~3.3+-1.1x10^-3
and relative to CN of ~4.6+-1.5. With a 21.3""x17.5"" synthesized beam around
Comet NEAT and using a VTOV model, we found an HCN column density of
N_T=8.5+-4.5x10^11 cm^-2, and a production rate of Q(HCN)=8.9+-4.7x10^25 s^-1,
giving a production rate ratio of HCN relative to H_2O of ~7.4+-3.9x10^-4 and
relative to CN of ~0.3+-0.2. For both comets, the production rates relative to
H_2O are similar to those found in previous comet observations. For Comet
LINEAR the production rate relative to CN is consistent with HCN being the
primary parent species of CN, while for Comet NEAT it is too low for this to be
the case.",2005-05-24T20:29:16Z
"Identification of the Red Supergiant Progenitor of Supernova 2005cs: Do
  the Progenitors of Type II-P Supernovae Have Low Mass?","The stars that end their lives as supernovae (SNe) have been directly
observed in only a handful of cases, due mainly to the extreme difficulty in
identifying them in images obtained prior to the SN explosions. Here we report
the identification of the progenitor for the recent Type II-plateau
(core-collapse) SN 2005cs in pre-explosion archival images of the Whirlpool
Galaxy (M51) obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS). From high-quality ground-based images of the SN from the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we precisely determine the position of the SN
and are able to isolate the SN progenitor to within 0"".04 in the HST/ACS
optical images. We further pinpoint the SN location to within 0"".005 from
HST/ACS ultraviolet images of the SN, confirming our progenitor identification.
  From photometry of the SN progenitor obtained with the pre-SN ACS images, and
also limits to its brightness in pre-SN HST/NICMOS images, we infer that the
progenitor is a red supergiant star of spectral type K0--M3, with initial mass
7--9 Msun. We also discuss the implications of the SN 2005cs progenitor
identification and its mass estimate. There is an emerging trend that the most
common Type II-plateau SNe originate from low-mass supergiants 8--15 Msun.",2005-07-18T02:51:43Z
Prospects for Redshifted 21-cm observations of quasar HII regions,"The introduction of low-frequency radio arrays over the coming decade is
expected to revolutionize the study of the reionization epoch. Observation of
the contrast in redshifted 21cm emission between a large HII region and the
surrounding neutral IGM will be the simplest and most easily interpreted
signature. We find that an instrument like the planned Mileura Widefield Array
Low-Frequency Demonstrator (LFD) will be able to obtain good signal to noise on
HII regions around the most luminous quasars, and determine some gross
geometric properties, e.g. whether the HII region is spherical or conical. A
hypothetical follow-up instrument with 10 times the collecting area of the LFD
(MWA-5000) will be capable of mapping the detailed geometry of HII regions,
while SKA will be capable of detecting very narrow spectral features as well as
the sharpness of the HII region boundary. The MWA-5000 will discover
serendipitous HII regions in widefield observations. We estimate the number of
HII regions which are expected to be generated by quasars. Assuming a late
reionization at z~6 we find that there should be several tens of quasar HII
regions larger than 4Mpc at z~6-8 per field of view. Identification of HII
regions in forthcoming 21cm surveys can guide a search for bright galaxies in
the middle of these regions. Most of the discovered galaxies would be the
massive hosts of dormant quasars that left behind fossil HII cavities that
persisted long after the quasar emission ended, owing to the long recombination
time of intergalactic hydrogen. A snap-shot survey of candidate HII regions
selected in redshifted 21cm image cubes may prove to be the most efficient
method for finding very high redshift quasars and galaxies.",2005-06-02T04:27:16Z
The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on the Swift MIDEX Mission,"The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is one of 3 instruments on the Swift MIDEX
spacecraft to study gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The BAT first detects the GRB and
localizes the burst direction to an accuracy of 1-4 arcmin within 20 sec after
the start of the event. The GRB trigger initiates an autonomous spacecraft slew
to point the two narrow field-of-view (FOV) instruments at the burst location
within 20-70 sec so to make follow-up x-ray and optical observations. The BAT
is a wide-FOV, coded-aperture instrument with a CdZnTe detector plane. The
detector plane is composed of 32,768 pieces of CdZnTe (4x4x2mm), and the
coded-aperture mask is composed of approximately 52,000 pieces of lead
(5x5x1mm) with a 1-m separation between mask and detector plane. The BAT
operates over the 15-150 keV energy range with approximately 7 keV resolution,
a sensitivity of approximately 10E-8 erg*cm^-2*s^-1, and a 1.4 sr (half-coded)
FOV. We expect to detect >100 GRBs/yr for a 2-year mission. The BAT also
performs an all-sky hard x-ray survey with a sensitivity of approximately 2
mCrab (systematic limit) and it serves as a hard x-ray transient monitor.",2005-07-18T14:37:43Z
"High-Resolution Molecular Line Observations of the Environment of the
  Class 0 Source B1-IRS","In this work we present VLA observations of the NH3, CCS, and H2O maser
emission at 1 cm from the star forming region B1-IRS (IRAS 03301+3057) with ~
5"" (=1750 AU) of angular resolution. CCS emission is distributed in three
clumps around the central source. These clumps exhibit a velocity gradient from
red- to blueshifted velocities toward B1-IRS, probably due to an interaction
with the outflow from an embedded protostar. The outflow and its powering
source are traced by a reflection nebula and an associated infrared point
source detected in a 2MASS K-band image. We find that this infrared point
source is associated with water maser emission distributed in an elongated
structure (~ 450 AU size) along the major axis of the reflection nebula and
tracing the base of the outflow of the region. Ammonia emission is extended and
spatially anticorrelated with CCS. This is the first time that this kind of
anticorrelation is observed in a star forming region with such a high angular
resolution, and illustrates the importance of time-dependent chemistry on small
spatial scales. The relatively large abundance of CCS with respect to ammonia,
compared with other star forming regions, suggests an extreme youth for the
B1-IRS object (<10E+5 yr). We suggest the possibility that CCS abundance is
enhanced via shock-induced chemistry.",2005-04-07T10:11:44Z
"Spectroscopy of i-Dropout Galaxies with an NB921-Band Depression in the
  Subaru Deep Field","We report new spectroscopy of two star-forming galaxies with strong Ly_alpha
emission at z=6.03 and z=6.04 in the Subaru Deep Field. These two objects are
originally selected as i'-dropouts (i'-z' > 1.5) showing an interesting
photometric property, the ``NB921 depression''. The NB921-band (centered at
9196A) magnitude is significantly depressed with respect to the z'-band
magnitude. The optical spectra of these two objects exhibit asymmetric
emission-lines at lambda_obs ~ 8540A and ~ 8560A, suggesting that these objects
are Ly_alpha emitters at z~6. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the Ly_alpha
emission of the two objects are 94A and 236A; the latter one is the Ly_alpha
emitter with the largest Ly_alpha equivalent width at z > 6 ever
spectroscopically confirmed. The spectroscopically measured Ly_alpha fluxes of
these two objects are consistent with the interpretation that the NB921
depression is caused by the contribution of the strong Ly_alpha emission to the
z'-band flux. Most of the NB921-depressed i'-dropout objects are thought to be
strong Ly_alpha emitters at 6.0 < z < 6.5; Galactic L and T dwarfs and
NB921-dropout galaxies at z > 6.6 do not dominate the NB921-depressed
i'-dropout sample. Thus the NB921-depression method is very useful for finding
high-z Ly_alpha emitters with a large Ly_alpha equivalent width over a large
redshift range, 6.0 < z < 6.5. Although the broadband-selected sample at z ~ 3
contains only a small fraction of objects with a Ly_alpha equivalent width
larger than 100A, the i'-dropout sample of the Subaru Deep Field contains a
much larger fraction of such strong Ly_alpha emitters. This may imply a strong
evolution of the Ly_alpha equivalent width from z > 6 to z ~ 3.",2005-08-07T18:33:33Z
"On the role of injection in kinetic approaches to nonlinear particle
  acceleration at non-relativistic shock waves","The dynamical reaction of the particles accelerated at a shock front by the
first order Fermi process can be determined within kinetic models that account
for both the hydrodynamics of the shocked fluid and the transport of the
accelerated particles. These models predict the appearance of multiple
solutions, all physically allowed. We discuss here the role of injection in
selecting the real solution, in the framework of a simple phenomenological
recipe, which is a variation of what is sometimes referred to as thermal
leakage. In this context we show that multiple solutions basically disappear
and when they are present they are limited to rather peculiar values of the
parameters. We also provide a quantitative calculation of the efficiency of
particle acceleration at cosmic ray modified shocks and we identify the
fraction of energy which is advected downstream and that of particles escaping
the system from upstream infinity at the maximum momentum. The consequences of
efficient particle acceleration for shock heating are also discussed.",2005-05-17T17:21:33Z
Representations of spectral coordinates in FITS,"Greisen & Calabretta describe a generalized method for specifying the
coordinates of FITS data samples. Following that general method, Calabretta &
Greisen describe detailed conventions for defining celestial coordinates as
they are projected onto a two-dimensional plane. The present paper extends the
discussion to the spectral coordinates of wavelength, frequency, and velocity.
World coordinate functions are defined for spectral axes sampled linearly in
wavelength, frequency, or velocity, linearly in the logarithm of wavelength or
frequency, as projected by ideal dispersing elements, and as specified by a
lookup table.",2005-07-12T16:26:48Z
A companion to AB Pic at the planet/brown dwarf boundary,"We report deep imaging observations of the young, nearby star AB Pic, a
member of the large Tucana-Horologium as sociation. We have detected a faint,
red source 5.5"" South of the star with JHK colors compatible with that of a
young substellar L dwarf. Follow-up observations at two additional epochs
confirm, with a confidence level of 4.7sigma, that the faint red object is a
companion to AB Pic rather than it being a stationary background object. A low
resolution K-band spectrum indicates an early-L spectral type for the
companion. Finally, evolutionary model predictions based on the JHK photometry
of AB Pic b indicate a mass of 13 to 14 MJup if its age is ~30Myr. Is AB Pic b
a massive planet or a minimum mass brown dwarf?",2005-04-29T11:14:57Z
"Photon-axion conversion as a mechanism for supernova dimming: Limits
  from CMB spectral distortion","Axion-photon conversion induced by intergalactic magnetic fields has been
proposed as an explanation for the dimming of distant supernovae of type Ia SNe
Ia) without cosmic acceleration. The effect depends on the intergalactic
electron density $n_e$ as well as the $B$-field strength and domain size. We
show that for $n_e\alt 10^{-9} {\rm cm}^{-3}$ the same mechanism would cause
excessive spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This
small-$n_e$ parameter region had been left open by the most restrictive
previous constraints based on the dispersion of quasar (QSO) spectra. The
combination of CMB and QSO limits suggests that the photon-axion conversion
mechanism can only play a subleading role for SN Ia dimming. A combined
analysis of all the observables affected by the photon-axion oscillations would
be required to give a final verdict on the viability of this model.",2005-06-03T15:35:52Z
"Spurious 'active longitudes' in parametric models of heavily spotted
  eclipsing binaries","In this paper, size distributions of starspots extrapolated from the case of
the Sun, are modelled on the eclipsing binary SV Cam to synthesise images of
stellar photospheres with high spot filling factors. These spot distributions
pepper the primary's surface with spots, many of which are below the resolution
capabilities of eclipse mapping and Doppler imaging techniques. The lightcurves
resulting from these modelled distributions are used to determine the
limitations of image reconstruction from photometric data. Surface brightness
distributions reconstructed from these lightcurves show distinctive spots on
the primary star at its quadrature points. It is concluded that two-spot
modelling or chi-squared minimisation techniques are more susceptible to
spurious structures being generated by systematic errors, arising from
incorrect assumptions about photospheric surface brightness, than simple
Fourier analysis of the light-curves.",2005-04-28T17:32:11Z
Statefinder diagnostic for holographic dark energy model,"In this paper we study the holographic dark energy model proposed by Li from
the statefinder viewpoint. We plot the evolutionary trajectories of the model
with $c=1$ in the statefinder parameter-planes. The statefinder diagrams
characterize the properties of the holographic dark energy and show the
discrimination between this scenario and other dark energy models. We also
perform a statefinder diagnostic to the holographic dark energy model in cases
of different $c$ which given by three fits to observational data. The result
indicates that from the statefinder viewpoint $c$ plays a significant role in
this model and should thus be determined seriously by future high precision
experiments.",2005-04-27T08:36:31Z
"Anti-correlated hard X-ray time lag in GRS 1915+105: evidence for a
  truncated accretion disc","Multi-wavelength observations of Galactic black hole candidate sources
indicate a close connection between the accretion disk emission and the jet
emission. The recent discovery of an anti-correlated time lag between the soft
and hard X-rays in Cygnus X-3 (Choudhury & Rao 2004) constrains the geometric
picture of the disk-jet connection into a truncated accretion disk, the
truncation radius being quite close to the black hole. Here we report the
detection of similar anti-correlated time lag in the superluminal jet source
GRS 1915+105. We show the existence of the pivoting in the X-ray spectrum
during the delayed anti-correlation and we also find that the QPO parameters
change along with the spectral pivoting. We explore theoretical models to
understand this phenomenon.",2005-06-14T20:26:30Z
Mira Variables in the OGLE Bulge fields,"(abridged) The 222000 I-band light curves of variable stars detected by the
OGLE-II survey in the direction of the Galactic Bulge have been fitted and have
also been correlated with the DENIS and 2MASS databases. Results are presented
for 2691 objects with I-band semi-amplitude larger than 0.45 magnitude,
corresponding to classical Mira variables. The Mira period distribution of 6
fields at similar longitude but spanning latitudes from -1.2 to -5.8 degrees
are statistically indistinguisable indicating similar populations with initial
masses of 1.5-2 \msol (corresponding to ages of 1-3 Gyr). A field at similar
longitude at b = -0.05 from Glass et al. (2001) does show a significantly
different period distribution, indicating the presence of a younger population
of 2.5-3 \msol and ages below 1 Gyr. The K-band period-luminosity relation is
presented for the whole sample, and for sub-fields. The zero point depends on
Galactic longitude. Simulations are carried out to show that the observed
dependence of the zero point with $l$, and the number of stars per field are
naturally explained using the model of disk and bulge stars of Binney et al.
(1997), for a viewing angle of 43 +/- 17 degrees. A comparison is made with
similar objects in the Magellanic Clouds, studied in a previous paper. The
slope of the PL-relation in the Bulge and the MCs agree within the errorbars. A
distance to the Galactic Centre between 8.6 and 9.0 kpc is derived (for an
assumed DM of 18.50 to the LMC).",2005-06-15T09:46:39Z
The sensitivity of Lick indices to abundance variations,"We present results of model atmosphere/line formation calculations which
quantitatively test how the 21 classical and four higher-order Balmer-line
Lick/IDS indices (Worthey et al. 1994; Worthey & Ottaviani 1997) depend on
individual elemental abundances (of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, magnesium, iron,
calcium, natrium, silicon, chromium, titanium) and overall metallicity in
various stellar evolutionary stages and at various metallicities. At low
metallicities the effects of an overall enhancement of alpha-elements are also
investigated. The general results obtained by Tripicco & Bell (1995) at solar
metallicity are confirmed, while details do differ. Tables are given detailing
to which element every index reacts significantly, as a function of
evolutionary stage and composition.
  This work validates a number of assumptions implicitly made in the stellar
population models of Thomas, Maraston & Bender (2003), which utilized the
results of Tripicco & Bell (1995) to include the effects of element abundance
ratios variations. In particular, these computations confirm that fractional
changes to index strengths computed at solar metallicity (and solar age) can be
applied over a wide range of abundances and ages, also to model old stellar
populations with non-solar abundance ratios. The use of metallicity-dependent
response functions is, however, required for the proper modelling of the
Balmer-line indices. While H beta still responds only moderately to abundance
ratio variations, the higher-order Balmer indices H gamma and H delta display
very strong dependencies at high metallicities. As shown in Thomas, Maraston &
Korn (2004), this result allows to remove systematic effects in age
determinations based on different Balmer-line indices. (abridged)",2005-04-26T13:30:15Z
Optical and Infrared Signatures of ULX's,"We have constructed a model to describe the optical emission from
ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We assume a binary model with a black hole
accreting matter from a Roche lobe filling companion star. We consider the
effects of radiative transport and radiative equilibrium in the irradiated
surfaces of both the star and a thin accretion disk. We have developed this
model as a tool with which to positively identify the optical counterparts of
ULXs, and subsequently derive parameters such as the black hole mass and the
luminosity class and spectral type of the counterpart. We examine the
dependence of the optical emission on these and other variables. We extend our
model to examine the magnitude variation at infrared wavelengths, and we find
that observations at these wavelengths may have more diagnostic power than in
the optical. We apply our model to existing HST observations of the candidates
for the optical counterpart of ULX X-7 in NGC 4559. All candidates could be
consistent with an irradiated star alone, but we find that a number of them are
too faint to fit with an irradiated star and disk together. Were one of these
the optical counterpart to X-7, it would display a significant temporal
variation.",2005-06-03T16:58:40Z
"An infrared study of galactic OH/IR stars. II. The `GLMP sample' of red
  oxygen-rich AGB stars","We present optical and near-infrared finding charts taken from the DSS and
2MASS surveys of 94 IRAS sources selected from the GLMP catalogue
(Garc\'{\i}a-Lario 1992), and accurate astrometry (~0.2"") for most of them.
Selection criteria were very red IRAS colours representative for OH/IR stars
with optically thick circumstellar shells and the presence of variability
according to the IRAS variability index (VAR>50). The main photometric
properties of the stars in this `GLMP sample' are presented, discussed and
compared with the correspondent properties of the `Arecibo sample' of OH/IR
stars studied in Jim\'enez-Esteban et al. (2005a). We find that 37% of the
sample (N=34) have no counterpart in the 2MASS, implying extremely high optical
depths of their shells. Most of the sources identified in the 2MASS are faint
(K>~8) and of very red colour in the near-infrared, as expected. The brightest
2MASS counterpart (K=5.3mag) was found for IRAS 18299--1705. Its blue colour
H--K=1.3 suggests that IRAS 8299--1705 is a post-AGB star. A couple of GLMP
sources have faint but relatively blue counterparts. They might be misidentifed
field stars or stars hich experienced recently a drop of their mass loss rates.
The `GLMP sample' in general is made of oxygen-rich AGB stars, which are highly
obscured by their circumstellar shells. They belong to the same population as
the reddest OH/IR stars in the `Arecibo sample'.",2005-08-03T18:56:30Z
How far do they go? The outer structure of dark matter halos,"We study the density profiles of collapsed galaxy-size dark matter halos with
masses 1e11-5e12 Msun focusing mostly on the halo outer regions from the formal
virial radius Rvir up to 5-7Rvir. We find that isolated halos in this mass
range extend well beyond Rvir exhibiting all properties of virialized objects
up to 2-3Rvir: relatively smooth density profiles and no systematic infall
velocities. The dark matter halos in this mass range do not grow as one naively
may expect through a steady accretion of satellites, i.e., on average there is
no mass infall. This is strikingly different from more massive halos, which
have large infall velocities outside of the virial radius. We provide accurate
fit for the density profile of these galaxy-size halos. For a wide range
(0.01-2)Rvir of radii the halo density profiles are fit with the approximation
rho=rho_s exp(-2n[x^{1/n}-1])+rho_m, where x=r/r_s, rho_m is the mean matter
density of the Universe, and the index n is in the range n=6-7.5. These
profiles do not show a sudden change of behavior beyond the virial radius. For
larger radii we combine the statistics of the initial fluctuations with the
spherical collapse model to obtain predictions for the mean and most probable
density profiles for halos of several masses. The model give excellent results
beyond 2-3 formal virial radii.",2005-06-17T23:52:27Z
"Gamma-Ray Bursts and the Earth: Exploration of Atmospheric, Biological,
  Climatic and Biogeochemical Effects","Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are likely to have made a number of significant
impacts on the Earth during the last billion years. We have used a
two-dimensional atmospheric model to investigate the effects on the Earth's
atmosphere of GRBs delivering a range of fluences, at various latitudes, at the
equinoxes and solstices, and at different times of day. We have estimated DNA
damage levels caused by increased solar UVB radiation, reduction in solar
visible light due to $\mathrm{NO_2}$ opacity, and deposition of nitrates
through rainout of $\mathrm{HNO_3}$. For the ``typical'' nearest burst in the
last billion years, we find globally averaged ozone depletion up to 38%.
Localized depletion reaches as much as 74%. Significant global depletion (at
least 10%) persists up to about 7 years after the burst. Our results depend
strongly on time of year and latitude over which the burst occurs. We find DNA
damage of up to 16 times the normal annual global average, well above lethal
levels for simple life forms such as phytoplankton. The greatest damage occurs
at low to mid latitudes. We find reductions in visible sunlight of a few
percent, primarily in the polar regions. Nitrate deposition similar to or
slightly greater than that currently caused by lightning is also observed,
lasting several years. We discuss how these results support the hypothesis that
the Late Ordovician mass extinction may have been initiated by a GRB.",2005-05-23T13:14:53Z
Search for muon enhancement at sea level from transient solar activity,"This paper presents first results of an ongoing study of a possible
association between muon enhancements at ground observed by the TUPI telescope
and transient events such as the Sun's X-ray activity. The analysis of the
observed phenomenon by using the GOES satellite archive data seems to indicate
that on most cases the Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs) could potentially be
associated with solar flares. We show that small scale solar flares, those with
prompt X-ray emission classified as C class (power above $10^{-6}Watts m^{-2}$
at 1 AU) may give rise to GLEs, probably associated with solar protons and ions
arriving to the Earth as a coherent particle pulse. The TUPI telescope's high
performance with these energetic solar particles arises mainly from: (1) its
high counting rate (up to $\sim 100$ KHz). This value in most cases is around
100 times higher than other detectors at ground and (2) due to its tracking
system. The telescope is always looking near the direction of the IMF lines.
The GLE's delay in relation of the X-ray prompt emission suggest that shock
driven by corona mass ejection (CME) is an essential requirement for the
particle acceleration efficiency.",2005-04-28T17:59:57Z
"Temperature fluctuations in HII regions: ionization by Cosmic Rays as a
  key mechanism","We present a detailed model capable of explaining quantitatively the
temperature fluctuations observed in luminous, large HII regions. The model is
based on two assumptions which we justify on the basis of observations: that
the major fraction of the hydrogen in the clouds that form the HII regions is
not photoionized and is essentially HI, this HII is lightly ionized by fluxes
of low energy cosmic rays (CR) produced by processes originating in the hot
stars which illuminate the regions.",2005-05-18T12:19:34Z
Evidence for Supernova light in all Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows,"We present an update of our systematic analysis of all Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)
afterglow data, now published through the end of 2004, in an attempt to detect
the predicted supernova light component. We fit the observed photometric light
curves as the sum of an afterglow, an underlying host galaxy, and a supernova
component. The latter is modeled using published UBVRI light curves of SN
1998bw as a template. The total sample of afterglows with established redshifts
contains now 29 bursts (GRB 970228 - GRB 041006). For 13 of them a weak
supernova excess (scaled to SN 1998bw) was found. In agreement with our earlier
result (Zeh et al. 2004) we find that also in the updated sample all bursts
with redshift < 0.7 show a supernova excess in their afterglow light curves.
The general lack of a detection of a supernova component at larger redshifts
can be explained with selection effects. These results strongly support our
previous conclusion based on all afterglow data of the years 1997 to 2002 that
in fact all afterglows of long-duration GRBs contain light from an associated
supernova.",2005-03-15T11:27:34Z
"Third-order perturbative solutions in the Lagrangian perturbation theory
  with pressure II: Effect of the transverse modes","Lagrangian perturbation theory for cosmological fluid describes structure
formation in the quasi-nonlinear stage well. In a previous paper, we presented
a third-order perturbative equation for Lagrangian perturbation with pressure.
There we considered only the longitudinal modes for the first-order
perturbation. In this paper, we generalize the perturbation, i.e., we consider
both the longitudinal and the transverse modes for the first-order
perturbation. Then we derive third-order perturbative equations and solutions.",2005-04-18T06:29:21Z
The Origin of UCDs in the Virgo Cluster,"We present the internal velocity dispersions and spectral line indices for
six Virgo ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies obtained from spectroscopy with
the Keck II 10-m telescope. We use these results: 1) to compare the Virgo UCDs
with the Fornax UCD population; 2) to compare UCDs with globular clusters (GCs)
to determine if UCDs and the most luminous GCs are the same or distinct
systems; 3) to further test the nucleated dwarf elliptical (dE,N) stripping
hypothesis for UCD formation.",2005-04-13T07:30:38Z
Modeling a coronal loop heated by MHD-turbulence nanoflares,"We model the hydrodynamic evolution of the plasma confined in a coronal loop,
30000 km long, subject to the heating of nanoflares due to intermittent
magnetic dissipative events in the MHD turbulence produced by loop footpoint
motions. We use the time-dependent distribution of energy dissipation along the
loop obtained from a hybrid shell model, occurring for a magnetic field of
about 10 G in corona; the relevant heating per unit volume along the loop is
used in the Palermo-Harvard loop plasma hydrodynamic model. We describe the
results focussing on the effects produced by the most intense heat pulses,
which lead to loop temperatures between 1 and 1.5 MK.",2005-06-28T11:20:01Z
"Fragmentation and Evolution of Molecular Clouds. I: Algorithm and First
  Results","We present a series of simulations of the fragmentation of a molecular cloud,
leading to the formation of a cluster of protostellar cores. The purpose of
these simulations is to address a specific numerical problem called artificial
fragmentation, that plagues SPH simulations of cloud fragmentation. We argue
that this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and that the only
reasonable and practical way to address it is to use a relatively new technique
called particle splitting. Our largest simulation has an effective resolution
of 256^3 particles (much higher than most previous SPH simulations of cloud
fragmentation) and results in the formation of a dense cluster containing ~3000
protostellar cores. It is the first simulation of this kind to properly resolve
the Jeans mass throughout the entire system, at all times, thus preventing
artificial fragmentation.",2005-04-30T17:58:42Z
"Towards an Understanding of the Physical Nature of MgII Absorption
  Systems","We discuss issues concerning the physical nature of intervening MgII quasar
absorption systems in light of results from our recent surveys using SDSS EDR
QSO spectra and data obtained at the MMT. These surveys indicate an excess of
weak $W_0^{\lambda2796} \lesssim 0.3$\AA) systems relative to the exponential
dN/dW distribution of stronger systems. The incidence of intermediate-strength
lines shows remarkably little evolution with redshift, thereby constraining
models for the nature of the clouds comprising these absorbers. The total
distribution does evolve, with the incidence decreasing with decreasing
redshift in a $W_0^{\lambda2796}$-dependent rate (the strongest systems evolve
the fastest). This suggests that multiple populations that evolve at different
rates contribute to the incidence in a $W_0^{\lambda2796}$-dependent manner. We
also present two images of fields containing unprecedented ``ultra-strong''
($W_0^{\lambda2796} \ge 4.0$\AA) MgII absorbers.",2005-05-06T19:26:51Z
A Library of Integrated Spectra of Galactic Globular Clusters,"We present a new library of integrated spectra of 40 Galactic globular
clusters, obtained with the Blanco 4-m telescope and the R-C spectrograph at
the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory. The spectra cover the range ~ 3350
-- 6430 A with ~ 3.1 A (FWHM) resolution. The spectroscopic observations and
data reduction were designed to integrate the full projected area within the
cluster core radii in order to properly sample the light from stars in all
relevant evolutionary stages. The S/N values of the flux-calibrated spectra
range from 50 to 240/A at 4000 A and from 125 to 500/A at 5000 A. The selected
targets span a wide range of cluster parameters, including metallicity,
horizontal-branch morphology, Galactic coordinates, Galactocentric distance,
and concentration. The total sample is thus fairly representative of the entire
Galactic globular cluster population and should be valuable for comparison with
similar integrated spectra of unresolved stellar populations in remote systems.
For most of the library clusters, our spectra can be coupled with deep
color-magnitude diagrams and reliable metal abundances from the literature to
enable the calibration of stellar population synthesis models. In this paper we
present a detailed account of the observations and data reduction. The spectral
library is publicly available in electronic format from the National Optical
Astronomical Observatory website.",2005-04-14T14:01:35Z
"What Can the Distribution of Intergalactic Metals Tell us About the
  History of Cosmological Enrichment?","I study the relationship between the spatial distribution of intergalactic
metals and the masses and ejection energies of the sources that produced them.
Over a wide range of models, metal enrichment is dominated by the smallest
efficient sources, as the enriched volume scales roughly as E^{3/5} ~ M^{3/5}
while the number density of sources goes as 1/M. In all cases, the earliest
sources have the biggest impact, because fixed comoving distances correspond to
smaller physical distances at higher redshifts. This means that most of the
enriched volume is found around rare peaks, and intergalactic metals are
naturally highly clustered. Furthermore, this clustering is so strong as to
lead to a large overlap between individual bubbles. Thus the typical radius of
enriched z ~ 3 regions should be interpreted as a constraint on groupings of
sources rather than the ejection radius of a typical source. Similarly, the
clustering of enriched regions should be taken as a measurement of source bias
rather than mass.",2005-04-04T20:01:39Z
Peak energy clustering and efficiency in compact objects,"We study the properties of plasmas containing a low energy thermal photon
component at comoving temperature \theta \equiv kT'/m_e c^2 \sim 10^{-5} -
10^{-2} interacting with an energetic electron component, characteristic of,
e.g., the dissipation phase of relativistic outflows in gamma-ray bursts
(GRB's), X-ray flashes, and blazars. We show that, for scattering optical
depths larger than a few, balance between Compton and inverse-Compton
scattering leads to the accumulation of electrons at values of $\gamma\beta ~
0.15 - 0.3$. For optical depths larger than ~ 100, this leads to a peak in the
comoving photon spectrum at 1-10 keV, very weakly dependent on the values of
the free parameters. In particular, these results are applicable to the
internal shock model of GRB, as well as to slow dissipation models, e.g. as
might be expected from reconnection, if the dissipation occurs at a
sub-photospheric radii. For GRB bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100, this results in
observed spectral peaks clustering in the 0.1-1 MeV range, with conversion
efficiencies of electron into photon energy in the BATSE range of ~ 30%.",2005-04-15T12:20:36Z
Virtual Observatory: From Concept to Implementation,"We review the origins of the Virtual Observatory (VO) concept, and the
current status of the efforts in this field. VO is the response of the
astronomical community to the challenges posed by the modern massive and
complex data sets. It is a framework in which information technology is
harnessed to organize, maintain, and explore the rich information content of
the exponentially growing data sets, and to enable a qualitatively new science
to be done with them. VO will become a complete, open, distributed, web-based
framework for astronomy of the early 21st century. A number of significant
efforts worldwide are now striving to convert this vision into reality. The
technological and methodological challenges posed by the information-rich
astronomy are also common to many other fields. We see a fundamental change in
the way all science is done, driven by the information technology revolution.",2005-04-01T00:57:22Z
Evaluation of cosmic ray rejection algorithms on single-shot exposures,"To maximise data output from single-shot astronomical images, the rejection
of cosmic rays is important. We present the results of a benchmark trial
comparing various cosmic ray rejection algorithms. The procedures assess
relative performances and characteristics of the processes in cosmic ray
detection, rates of false detections of true objects and the quality of image
cleaning and reconstruction. The cosmic ray rejection algorithms developed by
Rhoads (2000), van Dokkum (2001), Pych (2004) and the IRAF task xzap by
Dickinson are tested using both simulated and real data. It is found that
detection efficiency is independent of the density of cosmic rays in an image,
being more strongly affected by the density of real objects in the field. As
expected, spurious detections and alterations to real data in the cleaning
process are also significantly increased by high object densities. We find the
Rhoads' linear filtering method to produce the best performance in detection of
cosmic ray events, however, the popular van Dokkum algorithm exhibits the
highest overall performance in terms of detection and cleaning.",2005-06-21T01:19:07Z
CO in HI Self-Absorbed Clouds in Perseus,"We have observed 12CO J = 2-1 and J = 1-0, and 13CO J = 1-0 emission in two
regions of HI Self-Absorption (HISA) in Perseus: a small, isolated HISA feature
called the globule and a more extended HISA cloud called the complex. Using
both Large Velocity Gradient and Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes we found
that, in the globule, N(12CO) < 6.0x10^15 cm-2 which, using PDR models, implies
that N(H_2) < 9.9x10^20 cm-2. In the complex we found that the H_2 column
densities ranged from 1.2 - 2.2 x 10^21 cm-2. By comparing the HISA and CO
observations we are able to constrain the physical conditions and atomic gas
fraction (f). In the globule, 8 K < T_spin < 22 K and 0.02 < f < 0.2 depending
on whether the (unknown) gas density is 10^2, 10^3, or 10^4 cm-3. In the
complex, 12 K < T_spin < 24 K, 0.02 < f < 0.05, and we were also able to
constrain the gas density (100 < n < 1200 cm-3). These results imply that the
gas in the HISA clouds is colder and denser than that usually associated with
the atomic ISM and, indeed, is similar to that seen in molecular clouds. The
small atomic gas fractions also imply that there is a significant molecular
component in these HISA clouds, even when little or no 12CO is detected. The
level of 12CO detected and the visual extinction due to dust is consistent with
the idea that these HISA clouds are undergoing a transition from the atomic to
molecular phase.",2005-06-27T20:08:24Z
"Discovery of Rapid X-ray Oscillations in the Tail of the SGR 1806-20
  Hyperflare","We have discovered rapid Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in RXTE/PCA
measurements of the pulsating tail of the 27th December 2004 giant flare of SGR
1806-20. QPOs at about 92.5Hz are detected in a 50s interval starting 170s
after the onset of the giant flare. These QPOs appear to be associated with
increased emission by a relatively hard unpulsed component and are seen only
over phases of the 7.56s spin period pulsations away from the main peak. QPOs
at about 18 and 30Hz are also detected, 200-300s after the onset of the giant
flare. This is the first time that QPOs are unambiguously detected in the flux
of a Soft Gamma-ray Repeater, or any other magnetar candidate. We interpret the
highest QPOs in terms of the coupling of toroidal seismic modes with Alfven
waves propagating along magnetospheric field lines. The lowest frequency QPO
might instead provide indirect evidence on the strength of the internal
magnetic field of the neutron star.",2005-05-12T13:30:30Z
Interpreting Cosmological Vacuum Decay,"The cosmological vacuum decay scenario recently proposed by Wang and Meng
\cite{wm} is rediscussed. From thermodynamic arguments it is found that the
$\epsilon$ parameter quantifying the vacuum decay rate must be positive in the
presence of particle creation. If there is no particle creation, the proper
mass of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particles is necessarily a time dependent
quantity, scaling as $m(t) = m_o a(t)^{\epsilon}$. By considering the presence
of baryons in the cosmological scenario, it is also shown that their dynamic
effect is to alter the transition redshift $z_*$ (the redshift at which the
Universe switches from decelerating to accelerating expansion), predicting
values of $z_*$ compatible with current estimates based on type Ia supernova.
In order to constrain the $\Omega_m - \epsilon$ plane, a joint statistical
analysis involving the current supernovae observations, gas mass fraction
measurements in galaxy clusters and CMB data is performed. At 95% c.l. it is
found that the vacuum decay rate parameter lies on the interval $\epsilon =
0.11 \pm 0.12$). The possibility of a vacuum decay into photons is also
analyzed. In this case, the energy density of the radiation fluid scales as
$\rho_r = \rho_{ro}a^{-4 + \epsilon}$, and its temperature evolution law obeys
$T(t) = T_oa(t)^{\epsilon/4 - 1}$.",2005-07-15T13:05:10Z
"What are the temperatures of T Tauri stars? - Constraints from coeval
  formation of young eclipsing binaries","We show how the assumption of coeval formation can be used to constrain the
effective temperatures of the components of young eclipsing double-lined
spectroscopic binaries. Our method extends the approach of White et al. (1999)
to a two-step analysis. The first step compares evolutionary models to the
observed masses and radii and selects those models that predict ages that are
consistent with coeval formation. The second step then uses these models to
constrain the effective temperatures. We applied the method on literature
values of the stellar parameters of the eclipsing binaries RX J0529.4+0041 A
and V1174 Ori and confirm that V1174 Ori A has dwarf-like temperatures at an
age of 9 Myrs, while we cannot draw any conclusions for RX J0529.4+0041 A and
V1174 Ori B. Considering these binaries, we find that none of the evolutionary
models gives coeval solutions simultaneously in mass, radius and effective
temperature.",2005-06-30T18:13:34Z
"Late Arriving Particles in Cosmic Ray Air Showers and AGASA's
  Determination of UHECR Energies","We give the first detailed study of the arrival time distribution of nucleons
in UHECR air showers. We analyze in detail the influence of late arriving
particles on the energy determination of the AGASA experiment, as well as how
the arrival time distribution changes with distance from shower core. Our
calculations are consistent with experimental observations of the AGASA group.
Crucial to obtaining agreement, is the correct implementation of the energy
loss for low-energy protons. We confirm AGASA's estimation of the error in
their energy determination associated with late-arriving particles, assuming
primary protons.",2005-06-08T15:45:45Z
Unifying XRFs and GRBs with a Fisher-Shaped Universal Jet Model,"We show analytically that GRB jets with an emissivity profile given by the
Fisher distribution, epsilon(theta) = A * e^(B cos(theta)), have the unique
property of producing equal numbers of bursts per logarithmic interval in Eiso,
and therefore in most burst properties. Since this broad distribution of burst
properties is a key feature found by HETE-2, a Fisher-shaped universal jet
model can explain many of the observed properties of XRFs, X-ray-rich GRBs, and
GRBs reasonably well, in contrast to a power-law universal model. For small
viewing angles, the Fisher distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian,
whose properties have been explored by Zhang et al. (2004). We also show that
the Fisher universal jet model produces a broad distribution in the inferred
radiated energy Egamma_inf, in contrast to the narrow distribution predicted by
the uniform variable opening-angle jet model Lamb, Donaghy & Graziani (2005).
Here we present Monte Carlo simulations of both a Fisher-shaped universal jet
model and a Fisher-shaped variable opening-angle jet model.",2005-05-08T16:49:45Z
Constrained Cluster Parameters from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Observations,"Near-future SZ surveys such as ACT, SPT, APEX, and Planck will find thousands
of galaxy clusters. Multi-frequency arcminute-resolution SZ observations can,
in principle, determine each cluster's gas temperature (T_e), bulk velocity
(v_pec), and optical depth (tau). However, the frequency bands and detector
sensitivity employed by upcoming surveys will generally not be sufficient to
disentangle the degeneracy between these three cluster parameters, even in the
absence of SZ signal contamination from point sources and imperfect primary
microwave background subtraction. Assuming contaminants can be removed, we find
that near-future SZ surveys will be able to constrain well two cluster gas
parameters that are linear combinations of tau*T_e, tau*v_z, and tau*T_e^2.
Because the SZ intensity shift is nearly a linear function of tau*T_e, tau*v_z,
and tau*T_e^2, a correspondence exists between the two effective gas parameters
that SZ surveys can constrain and simple line-of-sight integrals through the
three dimensional cluster. We illustrate the parameter constraints and
correspondence to line-of-sight integrals using 3D Nbody + hydro cluster
simulations and a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We show that adding an
independent T_e measurement to upcoming SZ data breaks the parameter
degeneracy. The cluster effective velocity thus constrained is approximately
the optical-depth-weighted velocity integrated along the cluster line of sight.
A temperature prior with an error as large as 2 keV still gives bulk velocity
errors < 100 km/sec, even for a more typical cluster with an electron
temperature of 3 keV, for ACT-like SZ observations in the absence of signal
contamination. The Markov chain constraints on v_pec and tau are more
encouraging and likely more accurate than those obtained from Fisher matrices.",2005-04-12T17:39:05Z
"The Filamentary Large Scale Structure around the z = 2.16 Radio Galaxy
  PKS 1138-262","PKS 1138-262 is a massive radio galaxy at z = 2.16 surrounded by
overdensities of Lya emitters, Ha emitters, EROs and X-ray emitters. Numerous
lines of evidence exist that it is located in a forming cluster. We report on
Keck spectroscopy of candidate members of this protocluster, including nine of
the 18 X-ray sources detected by Pentericci et al. (2002) in this field. Two of
these X-ray sources (not counting PKS 1138-262 itself) were previously
confirmed to be members of the protocluster; we have discovered that an
additional two (both AGN) are members of a filamentary structure, at least 3.5
Mpc in projection, aligned with the radio jet axis, the 150 kpc-sized
emission-line halo, and the extended X-ray emission around the radio galaxy.
Three of the nine X-ray sources observed are lower redshift AGN, and three are
M-dwarf stars.",2005-05-17T19:20:56Z
Limits of Adaptive Optics for high contrast imaging,"The effects of photon noise, aliasing, wavefront chromaticity and
scintillation on the point spread function (PSF) contrast achievable with
ground based adaptive optics (AO) are evaluated for different wavefront sensing
schemes. I show that a wavefront sensor (WFS) based upon the Zernike phase
contrast technique offers the best sensitivity to photon noise at all spatial
frequencies, while the Shack-Hartmann WFS is significantly less sensitive. In
AO systems performing wavefront sensing in the visible and scientific imaging
in the near-IR, the PSF contrast limit is set by the scintillation chromaticity
induced by Fresnel propagation through the atmosphere. On a 8m telescope, the
PSF contrast is then limited to 1e-4 to 1e-5 in the central arcsecond.
Wavefront sensing and scientific imaging should therefore be done at the same
wavelength, in which case, on bright sources, PSF contrasts between 1e-6 and
1e-7 can be achieved within 1 arcsecond on a 8m telescope in optical/near-IR.
The impact of atmospheric turbulence parameters (seeing, wind speed, turbulence
profile) on the PSF contrast is quantified. I show that a focal plane wavefront
sensing scheme offers unique advantages, and I discuss how to implement it.
Coronagraphic options are also briefly discussed.",2005-05-05T00:04:24Z
Core and Conal Component Analysis of Pulsar B1237+25,"The paper provides a new analysis of this famous five-component ({\bf M})
pulsar. In addition to the star's core-active ``abnormal'' mode, we find two
distinct behaviors within its ``normal'' mode, a ``quiet-normal'' mode with
regular 2.8-period subpulse modulation and little or no core activity, and a
``flare-normal'' mode, where the core is regularly bright and a nearly 4-period
modulation is maintained. The ``flare-normal'' mode appears to be an
intermediate state between the ``quiet normal'' and ``abnormal'' behaviors.
Short 5--15-pulse ``flare-normal''-mode ``bursts'' and ``quiet normal''
intervals alternate with each other quasi-periodically, making a cycle some
60--80 pulses in duration. ``Abnormal''-mode intervals are interspersed within
this overall cycle, usually persisting for only a few pulses, but occasionally
lasting for scores or even many hundreds of pulses. Within subsequences where
the core is exceptionally quiet, the pulsar provides a nearly ``textbook''
example of a central PA sightline traverse--with a PA rate measured to be at
least some 180$\deg/\deg$. On this basis it is shown that the sightline impact
angle $\beta$ must be about 0.25\degr or some 5% of the outer conal beam
radius. The star's core component is found to be incomplete, despite the fact
that the core's full antisymmetric circularly polarized signature is present.
We find that the star's PA traverse is disrupted through the action of
orthogonally polarized linear power in the longitude range of the core
component. This behavior is modeled to show its effect. Finally, the star
provides two well defined fiducial points from which emission-height estimates
can be computed, the respective centers of both the linear PA traverse and the
zero-crossing point of the circular polarization signature.",2005-06-30T20:56:02Z
Asphericity and clumpiness in the winds of Luminous Blue Variables,"We present the first systematic spectropolarimetric study of Luminous Blue
Variables (LBVs) in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, in order to
investigate the geometries of their winds. We find that at least half of our
sample show changes in polarization across the strong H$\alpha$ emission line,
indicating that the light from the stars is intrinsically polarized and
therefore that asphericity already exists at the base of the wind. Multi-epoch
spectropolarimetry on four targets reveals variability in their intrinsic
polarization. Three of these, AG Car, HR Car and P Cyg, show a position angle
(PA) of polarization which appears random with time. Such behaviour can be
explained by the presence of strong wind-inhomogeneities, or `clumps' within
the wind. Only one star, R 127, shows variability at a constant PA, and hence
evidence for axi-symmetry as well as clumpiness. However, if viewed at low
inclination, and at limited temporal sampling, such a wind would produce a
seemingly random polarization of the type observed in the other three stars.
Time-resolved spectropolarimetric monitoring of LBVs is therefore required to
determine if LBV winds are axi-symmetric in general.
  The high fraction of LBVs ($>$ 50%) showing intrinsic polarization is to be
compared with the lower $\sim$ 20-25 % for similar studies of their
evolutionary neighbours, O supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars. We anticipate that
this higher incidence is due to the lower effective gravities of the LBVs,
coupled with their variable temperatures within the bi-stability jump regime.
This is also consistent with the higher incidence of wind asphericity that we
find in LBVs with strong H$\alpha$ emission and recent (last $\sim$ 10 years)
strong variability.",2005-05-17T12:22:14Z
"A Damped Ly-alpha Absorption-line System in an Apparent Void at Redshift
  2.38","We study the contents of an apparent void in the distribution of Ly-alpha
emitting galaxies at redshift 2.38. We show that this void is not empty, but
contains a damped Ly-alpha absorption-line system, seen in absorption against
background QSO 2138-4427. Imaging does not reveal any galaxy associated with
this absorption-line system, but it contains metals (Fe/H ~ -1.3), and its
large velocity range (~ 180 km/s) implies a significant mass.",2005-06-22T06:16:06Z
"Predicting Single-Temperature Fit to Multi-Component Thermal Plasma
  Spectra","Observed X-ray spectra of hot gas in clusters, groups, and individual
galaxies are commonly fit with a single-temperature thermal plasma model even
though the beam may contain emission from components with different
temperatures. Recently, Mazzotta et al. pointed out that thus derived T_spec
can be significantly different from commonly used definitions of average
temperature, such as emission- or emission measure-weighted T, and found an
analytic expression for predicting T_spec for a mixture of plasma spectra with
relatively hot temperatures (T>3 keV). In this Paper, we propose an algorithm
which can accurately predict T_spec in a much wider range of temperatures
(T>0.5 keV), and for essentially arbitrary abundance of heavy elements. This
algorithm can be applied in the deprojection analysis of objects with the
temperature and metallicity gradients, for correction of the PSF effects, for
consistent comparison of numerical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups
with the X-ray observations, and for estimating how emission from undetected
components can bias the global X-ray spectral analysis.",2005-04-05T07:16:58Z
A Jovian-mass Planet in Microlensing Event OGLE-2005-BLG-071,"We report the discovery of a several-Jupiter mass planetary companion to the
primary lens star in microlensing event OGLE-2005-BLG-071. Precise (<1%)
photometry at the peak of the event yields an extremely high signal-to-noise
ratio detection of a deviation from the light curve expected from an isolated
lens. The planetary character of this deviation is easily and unambiguously
discernible from the gross features of the light curve. Detailed modeling
yields a tightly-constrained planet-star mass ratio of q=m_p/M=0.0071+/-0.0003.
This is the second robust detection of a planet with microlensing,
demonstrating that the technique itself is viable and that planets are not rare
in the systems probed by microlensing, which typically lie several kpc toward
the Galactic center.",2005-05-20T20:00:15Z
The large asymmetric HI envelope of the isolated galaxy NGC 864 (CIG 96),"We present a HI synthesis imaging study of NGC 864 (CIG 96), a spiral galaxy
well isolated from similarly sized companions, yet presenting an intriguing
asymmetry in its integral HI spectrum. The asymmetry in the HI profile is
associated with a strong kinematical perturbation in the gaseous envelope of
the galaxy, where at one side the decay of the rotation curve is faster than
keplerian. We detect a small (M(HI) = 5 x 10^6 Msun) galaxy with a faint
optical counterpart at around 80 kpc projected distance from NGC 864. This
galaxy is probably not massive enough to have caused the perturbations in NGC
864. We discuss alternatives, such as the accretion of a gaseous companion at a
radial velocity lower than the maximum.",2005-06-30T19:59:17Z
"Very compact radio emission from high-mass protostars. II. Dust disks
  and ionized accretion flows","This paper reports 43 GHz imaging of the high-mass protostars W33A, AFGL 2591
and NGC 7538 IRS9 at 0.04'' and 0.6'' resolution. In each case, weak (~mJy),
compact (~100 AU) emission is detected, which has an elongated shape (axis
ratio ~3). For AFGL 2591 and NGC 7538 IRS9, the emission is single-peaked,
while for the highest luminosity source, W33A, a `mini-cluster' of three
sources is detected. The derived sizes, flux densities, and broad-band radio
spectra of the sources support recent models where the initial expansion of HII
regions around very young O-type stars is prevented by stellar gravity. In
these models, accretion flows onto high-mass stars originate in large-scale
molecular envelopes and become ionized close to the star. These models
reproduce our observations of ionized gas as well as the structure of the
molecular envelopes of these sources on 10^3--10^4 AU scales derived previously
from single-dish submillimeter continuum and line mapping. For AFGL 2591, the
43 GHz flux density is also consistent with dust emission from a disk seen in
near-infrared `speckle' images. However, the alignment of the 43 GHz emission
with the large-scale molecular outflow argues against an origin in a disk for
AFGL 2591 and NGC 7538 IRS9. In contrast, the outflow from W33A does not appear
to be collimated. Together with previously presented case studies of W3 IRS5
and AFGL 2136, our results indicate that the formation of stars and stellar
clusters with luminosities up to ~10^5 L0 proceeds through accretion and
produces collimated outflows as in the solar-type case, with the `additional
feature' that the accretion flow becomes ionized close to the star. Above ~10^5
L0, clusters of HII regions appear, and outflows are no longer collimated,
possibly as the result of mergers of protostars or pre-stellar cores.",2005-04-01T14:53:31Z
The redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts revisited,"In this letter, we calculate the redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts
assuming that they trace (i) the globally averaged star formation rate or (ii)
the average metallicity in the Universe. While at redshifts 5 and below, both
the star formation rate and metallicity are observationally determined modulo
some uncertainties, at higher redshifts there are few constraints. We
extrapolate the star formation rate and metallicity to higher redshifts and
explore models that are broadly consistent with bounds on the optical depth
from WMAP results. In addition, we also include parametric descriptions of the
luminosity function, and the typical spectrum for GRBs. With these essential
ingredients included in the modeling, we find that a substantial fraction 75%
of GRBs are expected to originate at redshifts below 4, in variance with some
previous estimates. Conversely, if we assume as expected for the collapsar
model that gamma-ray bursts favour a low metallicity environment and therefore,
relate the GRB rate to a simple model of the average metallicity as a function
of redshift, we find that a higher fraction of bursts, about 40% originate from
redshifts greater than 4. We conclude with the implications of SWIFT GRB
detections.",2005-05-24T20:37:07Z
BeppoSAX/PDS serendipitous detections at high galactic latitudes,"At a flux limit of ~10^(-11) erg/cm2/s in the 20-100 keV band, the PDS
instrument on-board BeppoSAX offers the opportunity to study the extragalactic
sky with an unprecedented sensitivity. In this work we report on the results of
a search in the BeppoSAX archive for serendipitous high energy sources at high
galactic latitudes (|b| > 13 deg). We have defined a set of twelve regions in
which the PDS/MECS cross-calibration constant is higher than the nominal value.
We attribute this mismatch to the presence of a serendipitous source in the PDS
field of view.In four cases the likely high energy emitter is also present in
the MECS field of view. In these cases, we have performed a broad band spectral
analysis (1.5-100 keV) so as to understand the source spectral behaviour and
compare it with previous BeppoSAX observations when available. In eight cases
the identification of the source likely to provide the PDS spectrum is based on
indirect evidence (extrapolation to lower energies and/or comparison to
previous observations). This approach leads to the discovery of six new hard
X-ray emitting objects (PKS 2356-611, 2MASX J14585116-1652223, NGC 1566, NGC
7319, PKS 0101-649 and ESO 025-G002) and to the presentation the PDS spectrum
of NGC 3227 for the first time. In the remaining five cases we provide extra
BeppoSAX observations that can be compared with measurements which are already
published and/or in the archive.",2005-06-10T13:28:15Z
Pioneer anomaly? Gravitational pull due to the Kuiper belt,"In this work we study the gravitational influence of the material extending
from Uranus orbit to the Kuiper belt and beyond on objects moving within these
regions. We conclude that a density distribution given by $\rho(r)=\frac{1}{r}$
(for $r\geq 20 UA$) generates a constant acceleration towards the Sun on those
objects, which, with the proper amount of mass, accounts for the blue shift
detected on the Pioneers space crafts. We also discuss the effect of this
gravitational pull on Neptune, and comment on the possible origin of such a
matter distribution.",2005-03-16T19:54:33Z
"Accretion Disc Structure and Orientation in the Lensed and Microlensed
  Q0957+561 Quasar","Because quasars are unresolved in optical imaging, their structures must
presently be inferred. Gravitational microlensing offers the possibility to
produce information about the luminous structure provided the Einstein ring
diameter of the microlensing particle is comparable to or smaller than the
radiating quasar components. The long brightness history measured for the Q0957
quasar has been analyzed previously for information about the microlensing
particles, and evidence for the existence of a cosmologically significant
population of planetary mass particles has been reported. The microlensing
results have also directly determined the sizes of the ultraviolet light
emitting surfaces in the quasar Autocorrelation analysis of the same brightness
record has produced evidence for complex structure in the quasar; if the quasar
suddenly brightens today, it is probable that it will brighten again after 129,
190, 540, and 620 days. We interpret these lags as the result of luminous
structure around the quasar, and in particular we interpret them in the context
of the Elvis (2000) model of the quasar's structure. We find that the
autocorrelation peaks imply that beyond the luminous inner edge of the
accretion disc, the biconic structures of the Elvis model must lie at a radial
distance of 2x10^17 cm from the black hole, and 2x10^16 cm above and below the
plane of the accretion disc. The quasar is apparently inclined 55 degrees to
the line of sight. A second possible solution with lower inclination and larger
structure is also indicated but statistically less probable.",2005-04-18T19:01:52Z

provide basic morphological features, along with bolometric luminosity and
color evolution (including Johnson/Cousins ""UBVRcIcJHK"", Gunn ""gri"", and

"The VVDS-VLA Deep Field II. Optical and near infrared identifications of
  VLA S(1.4GHz)>80 microJy sources in the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey VVDS-02h field","In this paper we present the optical and near-infrared identifications of the
1054 radio sources detected in the 20cm deep radio survey down to a 5sigma flux
limit of about 80 microJy obtained with the VLA in the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey
VVDS-02h deep field. Using U,B,V,R,I and K data, we identified 718 radio
sources (~74% of the whole sample). The photometric redshift analysis shows
that, in each magnitude bin, the radio sample has a higher median photometric
redshift than the whole optical sample, while the median (V-I) color of the
radio sources is redder than the median color of the whole optical sample.
These results suggest that radio detection is preferentially selecting galaxies
with higher intrinsic optical luminosity. From the analysis of the optical
properties of the radio sources as function of the radio flux, we found that
while about 35% of the radio sources are optically unidentified in the higher
radio flux bin (S> 1.0 mJy), the percentage of unidentified sources decreases
to about 25% in the faintest bins (S< 0.5 mJy). The median I magnitude for the
total sample of radio sources,i.e. including also the unidentified ones, is
brighter in the faintest radio bins than in the bin with higher radio flux.
This suggests that most of the faintest radio sources are likely to be
associated to relatively lower radio luminosity objects at relatively modest
redshift, rather than radio-powerful, AGN type objects at high redshift.",2005-06-28T10:03:37Z

"XMM-Newton View of PKS 2155-304: Characterizing the X-ray Variability
  Properties with EPIC-PN","Starting from XMM-Newton EPIC-PN data, we present the X-ray variability
characteristics of PKS 2155-304 using a simple analysis of the excess variance,
\xs, and of the fractional rms variability amplitude, fvar. The scatter in \xs\
and \fvar, calculated using 500 s long segments of the light curves, is smaller
than the scatter expected for red noise variability. This alone does not imply
that the underlying process responsible for the variability of the source is
stationary, since the real changes of the individual variance estimates are
possibly smaller than the large scatters expected for a red noise process. In
fact the averaged \xs and \fvar, reducing the fluctuations of the individual
variances, chang e with time, indicating non-stationary variability. Moreover,
both the averaged \sqxs (absolute rms variability amplitude) and \fvar show
linear correlation with source flux but in an opposite sense: \sqxs correlates
with flux, but \fvar anti-correlates with flux. These correlations suggest that
the variability process of the source is strongly non-stationary as random
scatters of variances should not yield any correlation. \fvar spectra were
constructed to compare variability amplitudes in different energy bands. We
found that the fractional rms variability amplitude of the source, when
significant variability is observed, increases logarithmically with the photon
energy, indicating significant spectral variability. The point-to-point
variability amplitude may also track this trend, suggesting that the slopes of
the power spectral density of the source are energy-independent. Using the
normalized excess variance the black hole mass of \pks was estimated to be
about $1.45 \times 10^8 M_{\bigodot}$. This is compared and contrasted with the
estimates derived from measurements of the host galaxies.",2005-05-09T03:31:47Z
GU Boo: A New 0.6 Msun Detached Eclipsing Binary,"We have found a new low-mass, double-lined, detached eclipsing binary, GU
Boo, among a sample of new variables from the ROTSE-I database. The binary has
an orbital period of 0.488728 +/- 0.000002 days, and estimated apparent
magnitudes Vrotse = 13.7 and I = 11.8. Our analysis of the light and radial
velocity curves of the system yields individual masses and radii of M1= 0.610
+/- 0.007 Msun, M2 = 0.599 +/- 0.006 Msun, R1= 0.623 +/- 0.016 Rsun, R2= 0.620
+/- 0.020 Rsun. The stars in GU Boo are therefore very similar to the
components of the eclipsing binary YY Gem. For this study we have adopted a
mean effective temperature for the binary of Teff = 3870 +/- 130 K. Based on
its space velocities we suggest that GU Boo is a main sequence binary, possibly
with an age of several Gyr. The metallicity of the binary is not well
constrained at this point but we speculate that it should not be very different
from solar. We have compared the physical parameters of GU Boo with current
low-mass stellar models, where we accounted for uncertainties in age and
metallicity by considering a wide range of values for those parameters. Our
comparisons reveal that all the models underestimate the radii of the
components of GU Boo by at least 10-15%. This result is in agreement with the
recent studies of YY Gem and CU Cnc.",2005-04-29T21:29:36Z
"NOAO Fundamental Plane Survey -- II. Age and Metallicity along the Red
  Sequence","We present spectroscopic linestrength data for 4097 red-sequence galaxies in
93 low-redshift galaxy clusters, and use these to investigate variations in
average stellar populations as a function of galaxy mass. Our analysis includes
an improved treatment of nebular emission contamination, which affects ~10% of
the sample galaxies. Using the stellar population models of D. Thomas and
collaborators, we simultaneously fit twelve observed linestrength-sigma
relations in terms of common underlying trends of age, [Z/H] (total
metallicity) and a/Fe (alpha-element enhancement). We find that the observed
linestrength-sigma relations can be explained only if higher-mass red-sequence
galaxies are, on average, older, more metal rich, and more alpha-enhanced than
lower-mass galaxies. Quantitatively, the scaling relations are
age=sigma^(0.59+/-0.13), Z/H=sigma^(0.53+/-0.08) and a/Fe=sigma^(0.31+/-0.06),
where the errors reflect the range obtained using different subsets of indices.
We conclude that although the stars in giant red galaxies in clusters formed
early, most of the galaxies at the faint end joined the red sequence only at
recent epochs. This ""down-sizing"" trend is in good qualitative agreement with
observations of the red sequence at higher redshifts, but is not predicted by
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.",2005-05-13T20:26:53Z
"Fe XI emission lines in a high resolution extreme ultraviolet spectrum

ratios are subsequently compared with observations of a solar active region,
obtained during the 1995 flight Solar EUV Research Telescope and Spectrograph
(SERTS). The version of SERTS flown in 1995 incorporated a multilayer grating
that enhanced the instrumental sensitivity for features in the 170 - 225 A
wavelength range, observed in second-order between 340 and 450 A. This
enhancement led to the detection of many emission lines not seen on previous
SERTS flights, which were measured with the highest spectral resolution (0.03
A) ever achieved for spatially resolved active region spectra in this
wavelength range. However, even at this high spectral resolution, several of
the Fe XI lines are found to be blended, although the sources of the blends are
identified in the majority of cases. The most useful Fe XI electron density
diagnostic line intensity ratio is I(184.80 A)/I(188.21 A). This ratio involves
lines close in wavelength and free from blends, and which varies by a factor of
11.7 between N_e = 10^9 and 10^11 cm^-3, yet shows little temperature
sensitivity. An unknown line in the SERTS spectrum at 189.00 A is found to be
due to Fe XI, the first time (to our knowledge) this feature has been
identified in the solar spectrum. Similarly, there are new identifications of
the Fe XI 192.88, 198.56 and 202.42 A features, although the latter two are
blended with S VIII/Fe XII and Fe XIII, respectively.",2005-04-05T11:57:55Z
Differential rotation on the lower main sequence,"We compute the differential rotation of main sequence stars of the spectral
types F, G, K, and M by solving the equation of motion and the equation of
convective heat transport in a mean-field formulation. For each spectral type
the rotation rate is varied to study the dependence of the surface shear on
this parameter. The resulting rotation patterns are all solar-type. The
horizontal shear turns out to depend strongly on the effective temperature and
only weakly on the rotation rate. The meridional flow depends more strongly on
the rotation rate and has different directions in the cases of very slow and
very fast rotation, respectively.",2005-04-19T13:10:22Z
Narrow Band Chandra X-ray Analysis of Supernova Remnant 3C391,"We present the narrow-band and the equivalent width (EW) images of the
thermal composite supernova remnant (SNR) 3C391 for the X-ray emission lines of
elements Mg, Si, & S using the Chandra ACIS Observational data. These EW images
reveal the spatial distribution of the emission of the metal species Mg, Si, &
S in the remnant. They have clumpy structure similar to that seen from the
broadband diffuse emission, suggesting that they are largely of interstellar
origin. We find an interesting finger-like feature protruding outside the
southwestern radio border of the remnant, which is somewhat similar to the
jet-like Si structure found in the famous SNR Cas A. This feature may possibly
be the debris of the jet of ejecta which implies an asymmetrical supernova
explosion of a massive progenitor star.",2005-05-02T16:05:19Z
A brief introduction to cosmic topology,"Whether we live in a spatially finite universe, and what its shape and size
may be, are among the fundamental long-standing questions in cosmology. These
questions of topological nature have become particularly topical, given the
wealth of increasingly accurate astro-cosmological observations, especially the
recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. An overview
of the basic context of cosmic topology, the detectability constraints from
recent observations, as well as the main methods for its detection and some
recent results are briefly presented.",2005-04-16T22:40:27Z
Magnetars,"P-stars are compact stars made of up and down quarks in beta-equilibrium with
electrons in a chromomagnetic condensate. P-stars are able to account for
compact stars like RXJ 1856.5-3754 and RXJ 0720.4-3125, stars with radius
comparable with canonical neutron stars, as well as super massive compact
objects like SgrA*. We discuss p-stars endowed with super strong dipolar
magnetic field which, following consolidated tradition in literature, are
referred to as magnetars. We show that soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous
X-ray pulsars can be understood within our theory. We find a well defined
criterion to distinguish rotation powered pulsars from magnetic powered
pulsars. We show that glitches, that in our magnetars are triggered by magnetic
dissipative effects in the inner core, explain both the quiescent emission and
bursts in soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars. We are able to
account for the braking glitch from SGR 1900+14 and the normal glitch from AXP
1E 2259+586 following a giant burst. We discuss and explain the observed anti
correlation between hardness ratio and intensity. Within our magnetar theory we
are able to account quantitatively for light curves for both gamma-ray
repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars. In particular we explain the puzzling
light curve after the June 18, 2002 giant burst from AXP 1E 2259+586, so that
we feel this last event as the Rosetta Stone for our theory. Finally, in
Appendix we discuss the origin of the soft emission not only for soft gamma-ray
repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars, but also for isolated X-ray pulsars. We
also offer an explanation for the puzzling spectral features in 1E 1207.4-5209.",2005-04-01T12:46:32Z
The MAGIC Telescope and the Observation of Gamma Ray Bursts,"The MAGIC Telescope, now taking data with an energy threshold well below 100
GeV, will soon be able to take full advantage of the fast slewing capability of
its altazimuthal mount. Exploiting the link with the GCN network, the MAGIC
Telescope could be one of the first ground-based experiments able to see the
prompt emission of Gamma Ray Bursts in the few tens of GeV region.",2005-04-14T00:38:13Z
"The accreting white dwarfs in BW Scl, BC UMa and SW UMa","We have observed the short-period dwarf novae BW Scl, BC UMa and SW UMa using
the Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. In all three
systems, the white dwarf is the dominant source of far-ultraviolet flux, even
though in BC UMa and SW UMa an additional continuum component contributes ~10%
and ~20% of the 1400A flux, respectively. Fitting the data with detailed white
dwarf model spectra, we determine the effective temperatures to be 14800+-900K
(BW Scl), 15200+-1000K (BC UMa), and 13900+-900K (SW UMa). The additional
continuum component in BC UMa and SW UMa is equally well described by either a
blackbody or a power law, which could be associated with emission from the hot
spot or from an optically thin accretion disk (or an optically thin layer on
top of a colder optically thick disk), respectively. Modelling the narrow metal
lines detected in the STIS spectra results in sub-solar abundances of carbon,
oxygen and silicon for all three systems, and also suggests substantial
supra-solar abundances of aluminium. The narrow absorption line profiles imply
low white dwarf rotation rates, v sin(i)<=300km/s for the three white dwarfs.
SW UMa is the only system that shows significant short-term variability in the
far-ultraviolet range, which is primarily associated with the observed emission
lines.",2005-04-18T11:10:38Z
Sungrazing comets as source of pickup ions at Earth orbit and Ulysses,"Most of the sungrazing comets observed by LASCO at SOHO belong to the Kreutz
group of comets and follow trajectories that are tightly clumped in space.
Statistical analysis of 9 years of SOHO observations suggests that the true
apparition rate of these comets is as high as one every other day. Practically
all these comets break up before perihelion passage. Their material is
dissociated and ionized, and subsequently transported away from the Sun as
pickup ions in the solar wind. Their mean mass flux is about $3.1 10^4 g/s.
Since the breakup occurs between 40 and 4 solar radii and the ionization is
almost immediate, the expected location of these ions in the phase space is
close to the location of the inner source of pickup ions. Assuming radial
propagation, the cometary pickups should be observable at Earth between August
and January, with peak probability at the end of September. At Ulysses, they
should be observable approximately between -25 and 40 degrees ecliptic latitude
during the fast latitude scans, the first of which occurred in 1995 and the
second in 2001. The population of cometary pickup ions should be augmented by
about 40% by solar wind protons as a result of charge exchange with the
cometary neutral hydrogen and oxygen atoms and subsequent reionization of the
newly-created Energetic Neutral Atoms, streaming with respect to the solar
wind. In total, the average flux of the pickup ions related to the sungrazing
comets at 1 AU should be about 1.6 10^5 g/s/sr within the detection area (and
null outside it). This value is comparable to the flux of the inner
source-pickup ions.",2005-07-04T12:38:58Z
"Is There an Imprint of Primordial Stars in the Tev Gamma-Ray Spectrum of
  Blazars?","The 1 - 5 micron diffuse sky emission from which local foreground emission
from the solar system and the Galaxy have been subtracted exceeds the
brightness that can be attributed to normal star forming galaxies. The nature
of this excess near-infrared background light (NIRBL) is still controversial.
On one hand, it has been interpreted as a distinct spectral feature created by
the redshifted emission from primordial (Population III) stars that have formed
at redshifts > 8. On the other hand, the NIRBL spectrum is almost identical to
that of the zodiacal cloud, raising the possibility that it is of local origin.
Blazars can, in principle, offer a simple test for the nature and origin of the
NIRBL. Very high energy gamma-ray photons emitted by these objects are
attenuated on route to earth by photon-photon interactions with the
extragalactic background light (EBL). This paper examines whether the
extragalactic nature of the NIRBL can be determined from the analysis of the
TeV spectra of blazars. (Abridged)",2005-08-04T13:49:23Z
Helical Jet in the Gravitationally Lensed Blazar PKS1830-211,"Recent radio VLBI observations of the complex gravitationally lensed system
PKS1830-211 have thrown up some questions with regard to the processes occuring
at the heart of the blazar source at a redshift of 2.51, which is viewed almost
straight down the jet axis. This work links, by a model of a helical jet
tracked by ballistically ejected plasmons from a precessing nozzle,
observations on the scale of tens of microarcseconds to those on the scale of
milliarcseconds. An observed jet precession period of 1.08 years is inferred
from the model, translating to an intrinsic period of 30.8 years for a source
at redshift 2.51 and an assumed jet bulk velocity of 0.99 c. This fits well
with the picture of an active galactic nucleus hosting a binary black hole
system at its centre, with the jet emitted by one member of the system, and the
precession as being due to its orbital motion around its companion.",2005-07-01T09:34:49Z
"Soft X-ray Transmission Spectroscopy of Warm/Hot Intergalactic Medium
  with XEUS","We discuss the detectability of Warm/Hot Intergalactic medium (WHIM) via the
absorption lines toward bright point sources with a future X-ray satellite
mission, XEUS. While we consider bright QSOs as specific examples, the
methodology can be applied to bright GRB afterglows. We create mock absorption
spectra for bright QSOs (more than 20 QSOs over the all sky) using a light-cone
output of a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. We assume that WHIM is under
collisional and photo-ionization equilibrium. If WHIM has a constant
metallicity of $Z=0.1Z_\odot$, approximately 2 O{\sc vii} absorption line
system with $>3\sigma$ will be detected on average along a random line-of-sight
toward bright QSOs up to $z=0.3$ for 30 ksec exposure.",2005-04-27T10:49:36Z
"Consequences of Disk Scale Height on LISA Confusion Noise from Close
  White Dwarf Binaries","Gravitational radiation from the Galactic population of close white dwarf
binaries (CWDBs) is expected to produce a confusion-limited signal at the lower
end of the sensitivity band of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).
The canonical scale height of the disk population has been taken to be 90 pc
for most studies of the nature of this confusion-limited signal. This estimate
is probably too low, and the consequences of a more realistic scale height are
investigated with a model of the LISA signal due to populations of close white
dwarf binaries with different scale heights. If the local space density of
CWDBs is held constant, increasing the scale height results in both an increase
in the overall strength of the confusion-limited signal as well as in increase
in the frequency at which the signals become individually resolvable. If the
total number of binaries is held constant, increasing the scale height results
in a reduction of the number of expected bright signals above the
confusion-limited signal at low frequencies. We introduce an estimator for
comparing this transition frequency that takes into account the signal
spreading at higher frequencies.",2005-04-06T03:45:41Z
VLA observations of broad 6-cm excited state OH lines in W49A,"Using the Very Large Array (VLA), we observed all three of the 6-cm lines of
the doublet Pi 1/2, J=1/2 state of OH with sub-arcsecond resolution (about 0.4
arcsec) in W49A. While the spatial distribution and the range in velocities of
the 6-cm lines are similar to those of the ground state (18-cm) OH lines, a
large fraction of the total emission in all three 6-cm lines has large
linewidths (about 5 -- 10 km/s) and is spatially-extended, very unlike typical
ground state OH masers which typically are point-like at VLA resolutions and
have linewidths less than 1 km/s. We find brightness temperatures of 5900 K,
4700 K, and greater than 730 K for the 4660-MHz, 4750-MHz, and 4765-MHz lines,
respectively. We conclude that these are indeed maser lines. However, the gains
are about 0.3, again very unlike the 18-cm lines which have gains greater than
10000. We compare the excited state OH emission with that from other molecules
observed with comparable angular resolution to estimate physical conditions in
the regions emitting the peculiar, low-gain maser lines. We also comment on the
relationship with the 18-cm masers",2005-04-05T16:43:16Z
"High-resolution spectroscopy of the old open cluster Collinder
  261:abundances of Iron and other elements","We present the analysis of high resolution spectra of six red giant stars in
the old open cluster Collinder 261. Reddening values for individual stars,
derived from the relation between colours and temperatures (deduced from our
fully spectroscopic analysis) are consistent with previous determinations based
on photometry. For this cluster we derive an iron abundance of [Fe/H] = -0.03
+/- 0.03. We also obtain the abundances of light metals (O, Na and Al),
alpha-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), elements of the Fe-group (Sc, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni)
and the neutron-capture element Ba. No intrinsic star-to-star scatter is
present in any of these elements within our sample. We compare our findings
with previous investigations on this cluster, discussing in detail differences
in analysis methods and results.",2005-05-30T17:43:53Z
"Analytic Gravitational-Force Calculations for Models of the Kuiper Belt,
  with Application to the Pioneer Anomaly","We use analytic techniques to study the gravitational force that would be
produced by different Kuiper-Belt mass distributions. In particular, we study
the 3-dimensional rings (and wedge) whose densities vary as the inverse of the
distance, as a constant, as the inverse-squared of the distance, as well as
that which varies according to the Boss-Peale model. These analytic
calculations yield physical insight into the physics of the problem. They also
verify that physically viable models of this type can produce neither the
magnitude nor the constancy of the Pioneer anomaly.",2005-06-13T18:07:47Z
"Cosmological parameters from combined second- and third-order aperture
  mass statistics of cosmic shear","We present predictions for cosmological parameter constraints from combined
measurements of second- and third-order statistics of cosmic shear. We define
the generalized third-order aperture mass statistics <M_ap^3> and show that it
contains much more information about the bispectrum of the projected matter
density than the skewness of the aperture mass. From theoretical models as well
as from LCDM ray-tracing simulations, we calculate <M_ap^2> and <M_ap^3> and
their dependence on cosmological parameters. The covariances including shot
noise and cosmic variance of M_ap^2, M_ap^3 and their cross-correlation are
calculated using ray-tracing simulations. We perform an extensive Fisher matrix
analysis, and for various combinations of cosmological parameters, we predict
1-sigma-errors corresponding to measurements from a deep 29 square degree
cosmic shear survey. Although the parameter degeneracies can not be lifted
completely, the (linear) combination of second- and third-order aperture mass
statistics reduces the errors significantly. The strong degeneracy between
Omega_m and sigma_8, present for all second-order cosmic shear measures, is
diminished substantially, whereas less improvement is found for the
near-degenerate pair consisting of the shape parameter Gamma and the spectral
index n_s. Uncertainties in the source galaxy redshift z_0 increase the errors
of all other parameters.",2005-05-29T12:20:47Z
"Detection of anomalous microwave emission in the Perseus molecular cloud
  with the COSMOSOMAS experiment","We present direct evidence for anomalous microwave emission in the Perseus
molecular cloud, which shows a clear rising spectrum from 11 to 17 GHz in the
data of the COSMOSOMAS experiment. By extending the frequency coverage using
WMAP maps convolved with the COSMOSOMAS scanning pattern we reveal a peak flux
density of 42 (+/-) 4 Jy at 22 GHz integrated over an extended area of 1.65 x
1.0 deg centered on RA = 55.4 (+/-) 0.1 deg and Dec = 31.8 (+/-) 0.1 deg
(J2000). The flux density that we measure at this frequency is nearly an order
of magnitude higher than can be explained in terms of normal galactic emission
processes (synchrotron, free-free and thermal dust). An extended IRAS dust
feature G159.6-18.5 is found near this position and no bright unresolved source
which could be an ultracompact HII region or gigahertz peaked source could be
found. An adequate fit for the spectral density distribution can be achieved
from 10 to 50 GHz by including a very significant contribution from electric
dipole emission from small spinning dust grains.",2005-03-31T20:45:21Z
"Global MHD Modelling of the ISM - From large towards small scale
  turbulence","Dealing numerically with the turbulent nature and non-linearity of the
physical processes involved in the ISM requires the use of sophisticated
numerical schemes coupled to HD and MHD mathematical models. SNe are the main
drivers of the interstellar turbulence by transferring kinetic energy into the
system. This energy is dissipated by shocks (which is more efficient) and by
molecular viscosity. We carried out adaptive mesh refinement simulations (with
a finest resolution of 0.625 pc) of the turbulent ISM embedded in a magnetic
field with mean field components of 2 and 3 $\mu$G. The time scale of our run
was 400 Myr, sufficiently long to avoid memory effects of the initial setup,
and to allow for a global dynamical equilibrium to be reached in case of a
constant energy input rate. It is found that the longitudinal and transverse
turbulent length scales have a time averaged (over a period of 50 Myr) ratio of
0.52-0.6, almost similar to the one expected for isotropic homogeneous
turbulence. The mean characteristic size of the larger eddies is found to be
\~75 pc in both runs. In order to check the simulations against observations,
we monitored the OVI and HI column densities within a superbubble created by
the explosions of 19 SNe having masses and velocities of the stars that
exploded in vicinity of the Sun generating the Local Bubble. The model
reproduces the FUSE absorption measurements towards 25 white dwarfs of the \ovi
column density as function of distance and of \nhi. In particular for lines of
sight with lengths smaller than 120 pc it is found that there is no correlation
between N(OVI) and N(HI).",2005-05-04T12:34:18Z
Planned Dark Matter searches with the MAGIC Telescope,"The MAGIC 17m-diameter Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) has been
commissioned beginning of 2005. The telescope has been designed to achieve the
lower detection energy threshold ever obtained with an IACT, about 50 GeV. A
new window in gamma-ray astronomy is being opened with great impact for
exciting new physics and new discoveries. Among the targets of MAGIC is the
indirect detection of Dark Matter (DM). We have considered different DM halo
models of high DM density objects like the center of the Milky Way, its closest
satellites and nearby galaxies (M31,M87). For each object, detection limits are
computed for different DM halo models in a mSUGRA scenario for supersymmetric
neutralino annihilation $\gamma$-ray production. Advantages and drawbacks of
these objects and plans for future observations are discussed.",2005-05-15T18:28:22Z
"Near-Infrared photometry of four metal-rich Bulge globular clusters:
  NGC6304, NGC6569, NGC6637, NGC6638","We present high-quality near-Infrared photometry of four Bulge metal-rich
globular clusters, namely: NGC 6304, NGC 6569, NGC 6637 and NGC 6638. By using
the observed Colour-Magnitude Diagrams we derived a photometric estimates of
the cluster reddening and distance. We performed a detailed analysis of the Red
Giant Branch, presenting a complete description of morphologic parameters and
evolutionary features (Bump and Tip). Photometric estimates of the cluster
metallicity have been obtained by using the updated set of relations (published
by our group) linking the metal abundance to a variety of near-Infrared indices
measured along the Red Giant Branch. The detection of the Red Giant Branch Bump
and the Tip is also presented and briefly discussed.",2005-05-05T18:15:01Z
Models of class II methanol masers based on improved molecular data,"The class II masers of methanol are associated with the early stages of
formation of high-mass stars. Modelling of these dense, dusty environments has
demonstrated that pumping by infrared radiation can account for the observed
masers. Collisions with other molecules in the ambient gas also play a
significant role, but have not been well modelled in the past. Here we examine
the effects on the maser models of newly available collision rate coefficients
for methanol. The new collision data does not alter which transitions become
masers in the models, but does influence their brightness and the conditions
under which they switch on and off. At gas temperatures above 100 K the effects
are broadly consistent with a reduction in the overall collision cross-section.
This means, for example, that a slightly higher gas density than identified
previously can account for most of the observed masers in W3(OH). We have also
examined the effects of including more excited state energy levels in the
models, and find that these play a significant role only at dust temperatures
above 300 K. An updated list of class II methanol maser candidates is
presented.",2005-04-08T01:08:18Z
Absolute Calibration of the Auger Fluorescence Detectors,"Absolute calibration of the Pierre Auger Observatory fluorescence detectors
uses a light source at the telescope aperture. The technique accounts for the
ombined effects of all detector components in a single measurement. The
calibrated 2.5 m diameter light source fills the aperture, providing uniform
illumination to each pixel. The known flux from the light source and the
response of the acquisition system give the required calibration for each
pixel. In the lab, light source uniformity is studied using CCD images and the
intensity is measured relative to NIST-calibrated photodiodes. Overall
uncertainties are presently 12%, and are dominated by systematics.",2005-07-14T15:02:17Z
SBS 0335-052W: The Lowest-Metallicity Star-Forming Galaxy Known,"We present 4-meter Kitt Peak telescope and 6.5-meter MMT spectrophotometry of
the extremely low-metallicity galaxy SBS 0335-052W, the western companion of
the blue compact dwarf galaxy SBS 0335-052E. These observations have been
combined with published 10-meter Keck data to derive for the brightest region
of SBS 0335-052W an oxygen abundance 12+logO/H=7.12+/-0.03. This makes SBS
0335-052W the lowest metallicity star-forming galaxy known in the local
universe. Using a Monte Carlo technique, we fit the spectral energy
distribution of SBS 0335-052W to derive the age of the oldest stars
contributing to its optical light. We find that star formation in SBS 0335-052W
began less than 500 Myr ago, making it a likely nearby young dwarf galaxy.",2005-06-21T14:54:36Z
TeV Dark Matter detection by Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes,"Ground based Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes have recently unveiled a TeV
gamma-ray signal from the direction of the Galactic Centre. We examine whether
these gamma-rays, observed by the VERITAS, CANGAROO-II and HESS collaborations,
may arise from annihilations of dark matter particles. Emission from nearby
dwarf spheroidals, such as Sagittarius, could provide a test of this scenario.",2005-05-19T17:00:02Z
"Spitzer Observations of CO2 Ice Towards Field Stars in the Taurus
  Molecular Cloud","We present the first Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations of the 15.2
micron bending mode of CO2 ice towards field stars behind a quiescent dark
cloud. CO2 ice is detected towards 2 field stars (Elias 16, Elias 3) and a
single protostar (HL Tau) with anabundance of ~15-20% relative to water ice.
CO2 ice is not detected towards the source with lowest extinction in our
sample, Tamura 17 (A_V = 3.9m). A comparison of the Elias 16 spectrum with
laboratory data demonstrates that the majority of CO2 ice is embedded in a
polar H2O-rich ice component, with ~15% of CO2 residing in an apolar H2O-poor
mantle. This is the first detection of apolar CO2 towards a field star. We find
that the CO2 extinction threshold is A_V = 4m +/- 1m, comparable to the
threshold for water ice, but significantly less than the threshold for CO ice,
the likely precursor of CO2. Our results confirm CO2 ice forms in tandem with
H2O ice along quiescent lines of sight. This argues for CO2 ice formation via a
mechanism similar to that responsible for H2O ice formation, viz. simple
catalytic reactions on grain surfaces.",2005-05-17T11:21:19Z
The population of BzK selected ULIRGs at z~2,"We investigate the multi-wavelength emission of BzK selected star forming
galaxies at z~2 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) North
region. Most (82%) of the sources are individually detected at 24um in the
Spitzer MIPS imaging, and one fourth (26%) in the VLA radio data. Significant
detections of the individually undetected objects are obtained through stacking
in the radio, submm and X-ray domains. The typical star forming galaxy with
stellar mass ~10^{11}Mo at z=2 is an Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG),
with L_IR ~ 1-2x10^{12}Lo and star formation rate SFR 200-300Mo/yr, implying a
comoving density of ULIRGs at z=2 at least 3 orders of magnitude above the
local one. SFRs derived from the reddening corrected UV luminosities agree
well, on average, with the longer wavelength estimates. The high 24um detection
rate suggests a relatively large duty cycle for the BzK star forming phase,
consistently with the available independent measurements of the space density
of passively evolving galaxies at z>1.4. If the IMF at z=2 is similar to the
local one, and in particular is not a top-heavy IMF, this suggests that a
substantial fraction of the high mass tail (>10^{11}Mo) of the galaxy stellar
mass function was completed by z~1.4.",2005-07-21T11:15:21Z
"Type Ia supernovae tests of fractal bubble universe with no cosmic
  acceleration","The unexpected dimness of Type Ia supernovae at redshifts z >~ 1 has over the
past 7 years been seen as an indication that the expansion of the universe is
accelerating. A new model cosmology, the ""fractal bubble model"", has been
proposed by one of us [gr-qc/0503099], based on the idea that our observed
universe resides in an underdense bubble remnant from a primordial epoch of
cosmic inflation, together with a new solution for averaging in an
inhomogeneous universe. Although there is no cosmic acceleration, it is claimed
that the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae data will nonetheless fit
the new model, since it mimics a Milne universe at low redshifts. In this paper
the hypothesis is tested statistically against the available type Ia supernovae
data by both chi-square and Bayesian methods. While the standard model with
cosmological constant Omega_Lambda = 1-Omega_m is favoured by a Bayesian
analysis with wide priors, the comparison depends strongly on the priors chosen
for the density parameter, Omega_m. The fractal bubble model gives better
agreement generally for Omega_m<0.2. It also gives reasonably good fits for all
the range, Omega_m=0.01-0.55, allowing the possibility of a viable cosmology
with just baryonic matter, or alternatively with both baryonic matter and
additional cold dark matter.",2005-04-08T10:57:51Z
Perturbative analysis of multiple-field cosmological inflation,"We develop a general formalism for analyzing linear perturbations in
multiple-field cosmological inflation based on the gauge-ready approach. Our
inflationary model consists of an arbitrary number of scalar fields with
non-minimal kinetic terms. We solve the equations for scalar- and tensor-type
perturbations during inflation to the first order in slow-roll, and then obtain
the super-horizon solutions for adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations after
inflation. Analytic expressions for power-spectra and spectral indices arising
from multiple-field inflation are presented.",2005-07-27T10:25:44Z
Dynamical Friction and Cooling Flows in Galaxy Clusters,"We investigate a model of galaxy clusters in which the hot intracluster gas
is efficiently heated by dynamical friction (DF) of galaxies. We allow for both
subsonic and supersonic motions of galaxies and use the gravitational drag
formula in a gaseous medium presented by Ostriker (1999). The energy lost by
the galaxies is either redistributed locally or into a Gaussian centered on the
galaxy. We find that the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium and strict energy
balance yields a trivial isothermal solution T_iso, independent of radius, or
rising temperature distributions provided T_iso/gamma < T < T_iso, where gamma
is the adiabatic index of the gas. The isothermal temperature corresponds to
the usual scaling relation between the gas temperatures and the velocity
dispersions of galaxies. However the minimal temperature associated with the
rising solutions is ~ 0.5 T_vir, larger than that inferred from observations,
the radial distribution of galaxy masses notwithstanding. Heating by
supersonically moving galaxies cannot suppress thermal instability, although it
can lengthen the growth time up to the level comparable to the ages of clusters
when Mach number of galaxies is less than about two. We show using numerical
hydrodynamic simulations that DF-induced heating is generally unable to produce
stable equilibrium cores by evolving arbitrary non-equilibrium clusters,
although it can lengthen the cooling time. We conclude that DF-induced heating
alone is an unlikely solution to the cooling flow problem, although it can
still be an important heat supplier, considerably delaying cooling catastrophe.
We discuss other potential consequences of DF of galaxies in galaxy clusters.",2005-06-24T00:52:05Z
Molecular Hydrogen Excitation around Active Galactic Nuclei,"We report R~3000 VLT ISAAC K-band spectroscopy of the nuclei (i.e. central
100-300pc) of 9 galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus. For 5 of these we
also present spectra of the circumnuclear region out to 1kpc. We have measured
a number of H_2 lines in the v=1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 vibrational transitions, as
well as the Br_gamma and HeI recombination lines, and the NaI stellar
absorption. Although only 3 of the galaxies are classified as Seyfert 1s in the
literature, broad Br_gamma (FWHM 1000kms) is seen in 7 of the objects. The
v=1-0 emission appears thermalised at T~1000K. However, the v=2-1 and 3-2
emission show evidence of being radiatively excited by far-UV photons. The PDR
models that fit the data best are, as for the ultraluminous infrared galaxies
in Davies et al. (2003), those for which the H_2 emission arises in dense
clouds illuminated by intense FUV radiation. The NaI stellar absorption is
clearly seen in 6 of the nuclear spectra, indicating the presence of a
significant population of late type stars. It is possible that these stars are
a result of the same episode of star formation that gave rise to the stars
heating the PDRs. It seems unlikely that the AGN is the dominant source of
excitation for the near infrared H_2 emission: in two nuclei H_2 was not
detected at all, and in general we find no evidence of suppression of the
2-1S(3) line, which may occur in X-ray irradiated gas. Our data do not reveal
any significant difference between the nuclear and circumnuclear line ratios,
suggesting that the physical conditions of the dominant excitation mechanism
are similar both near the AGN and in the larger scale environment around it,
and that star formation is an important process even in the central 100pc
acround AGN.",2005-07-04T11:46:32Z
"Early and Rapid Merging as a Formation Mechanism of Massive Galaxies:
  Empirical Constraints","We present the results of a series of empirical computations regarding the
role of major mergers in forming the stellar masses of modern galaxies based on
measurements of galaxy merger and star formation histories from z~0.5-3. We
re-construct the merger history of normal field galaxies from z~3 to z~0 as a
function of initial mass using published pair fractions and merger fractions
from structural analyses. We calibrate the observed merger time-scale and mass
ratios for galaxy mergers using self-consistent N-body models of mergers,
composed of dark matter and stars, with mass ratios from 1:1 to 1:5 with
various orbital properties and viewing angles. We use these simulations to
determine the time-scales and mass ratios that produce structures that would be
identified as major mergers. Based on these calculations we argue that a
typical massive galaxy at z~3 with M_{*} > 10^{10} M_0 undergoes
4.4^{+1.6}_{-0.9} major mergers at z > 1. We find that by z~1.5 the stellar
mass of an average massive galaxy is relatively established, a scenario
qualitatively favored in a lambda dominated universe. We argue that the final
masses of these systems increases by as much as a factor of 100 allowing
Lyman-break galaxies, which tend to have low stellar masses, to become the most
massive galaxies in today's universe with M > M^{*}. Induced star formation
however only accounts for 10-30% of the stellar mass formed in these galaxies
at z < 3. A comparison to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation shows that
Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models consistently under-predict the merger fraction,
and rate of merging, of massive galaxies at high redshift. This suggests that
massive galaxy formation occurs through more merging than predicted in CDM
models, rather than a rapid early collapse.",2005-07-06T20:00:33Z
"Runaway electromagnetic cascade in shear flows and high energy radiation
  of astrophysical jets","We propose a straightforward and efficient mechanism of the high energy
emission of astrophysical jets associated with an exchange of interacting high
energy photons between the jet and external environment and vice versa.
Interactions which play the main role in this mechanism, are e^+ e^- pair
production by photons and inverse Compton scattering. The process has been
studied with numerical simulations demonstrating that under reasonable
conditions it has a supercritical character: high energy photons breed
exponentially being fed directly by the bulk kinetic energy of the jet.
Eventually, there is a feedback of particles on the fluid dynamics and the jet
partially decelerates.",2005-06-15T17:02:48Z
"The K20 survey. VII. The spectroscopic catalogue: spectral properties
  and evolution of the galaxy population","The K20 survey is a near infrared-selected, deep (Ks < 20) redshift survey
targeting galaxies in two independent regions of the sky, the CDFS and the
q0055-2659 field. The total Ks-selected sample includes 545 objects. Optical
spectra for 525 of them have been obtained, providing 501 spectroscopic
identifications (including 12 type-1 AGN and 45 stars). This paper describes
the final K20 spectroscopic catalogue, along with the technique used to
determine redshifts, measure the spectral features and characterize the
spectra. The classification of the galaxy spectra has been performed according
to a simple parametric recipe that uses the equivalent widths of the two main
emission lines (O[II] and Halpha+[N II]) and two continuum indices (the 4000A
break index, and a near-UV color index, C(28-39)). We defined three main
spectroscopic classes: red early-type galaxies, blue emission-line galaxies and
the intermediate galaxies, which show emission lines but a red continuum. More
than 95% of the examined galaxies is included in one of these spectral types
and a composite spectrum is built for each of the three galaxy classes. The
blue emission-line and the early-type galaxies have been divided in redshift
bins, and the corresponding composite spectra have been built, in order to
investigate the evolution of the spectral properties of the K20 galaxies with
redshift.",2005-04-11T16:35:48Z
The subpulse modulation properties of pulsars at 21 cm,"We present the results of a systematic, unbiased search for subpulse
modulation of 187 pulsars performed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope (WSRT) in the Netherlands at an observing wavelength of 21 cm. Using
new observations and archival WSRT data we have expanded the list of pulsars
which show the drifting subpulse phenomenon by 42, indicating that at least one
in three pulsars exhibits this phenomenon. The real fraction of pulsars which
show the drifting phenomenon is likely to be larger than some 55%. The majority
of the analysed pulsars show subpulse modulation (170), of which the majority
were not previously known to show subpulse modulation and 30 show clear
systematic drifting. The large number of new drifters we have found allows us,
for the first time, to do meaningful statistics on the drifting phenomenon. We
find that the drifting phenomenon is correlated with the pulsar age such that
drifting is more likely to occur in older pulsars. Pulsars which drift more
coherently seem to be older and have a lower modulation index. There is no
significant correlation found between P3 and other pulsar parameters (such as
the pulsar age), as has been reported in the past. There is no significant
preference of drift direction and the drift direction is not found to be
correlated with pulsar parameters. None of the four complexity parameters
predicted by different emission models (Jenet & Gil 2003) are shown to be
inconsistent with the set of modulation indices of our sample of pulsars.
Therefore none of the models can be ruled out based on our observations. We
also present results on some interesting new individual sources like a pulsar
which shows similar subpulse modulation in both the main- and interpulse and
six pulsars with opposite drift senses in different components.",2005-07-12T12:56:45Z
"Fluctuations in the EAS radio signal derived with improved Monte Carlo
  simulations based on CORSIKA","Cosmic ray air showers are known to emit pulsed radio emission which can be
understood as coherent geosynchrotron radiation arising from the deflection of
electron-positron pairs in the earth's magnetic field. Here, we present
simulations carried out with an improved version of our Monte Carlo code for
the calculation of geosynchrotron radiation. Replacing the formerly
analytically parametrised longitudinal air shower development with
CORSIKA-generated longitudinal profiles, we study the radio flux variations
arising from inherent fluctuations between individual air showers.
Additionally, we quantify the dependence of the radio emission on the nature of
the primary particle by comparing the emission generated by proton- and
iron-induced showers. This is only the first step in the incorporation of a
more realistic air shower model into our Monte Carlo code. The inclusion of
highly realistic CORSIKA-based particle energy, momentum and spatial
distributions together with an analytical treatment of ionisation losses will
soon allow simulations of the radio emission with unprecedented detail. This is
especially important to assess the emission strengths at large radial
distances, needed for event-to-event comparisons of the radio signals measured
by LOPES in conjunction with KASCADE-Grande and for considerations regarding
large arrays of radio antennas intended to measure the radio emission from
ultra-high energy cosmic rays, as with LOFAR or in the Pierre Auger
Observatory.",2005-07-01T13:10:48Z
Generalized holographic dark energy and the IR cutoff problem,"We consider a holographic dark energy model, in which both the CC energy
density rho_Lambda and the Newton constant G_N are varying quantities, to study
the problem of setting an effective field-theory IR cutoff. Assuming that
ordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation
univocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either
rho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy
disfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially
flat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is
not allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the
redshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for
the IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence
problem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to
spatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice
for the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a
universe that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from
deceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff
consistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy
variation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses
near the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance
with holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square
root of the Hubble parameter. We find that such a setup, in which the only
undetermined input represents the true ground state of the vacuum, can give
early deceleration as well as late time acceleration. The possibility of
further improvement of the model is also briefly indicated.",2005-07-28T14:00:30Z
"Three-dimensional MHD simulations of X-ray emitting subcluster plasmas
  in cluster of galaxies","Recent high resolution observations by the {\it Chandra} X-ray satellite
revealed various substructures in hot X-ray emitting plasmas in cluster of
galaxies. For example, {\it Chandra} revealed the existence of sharp
discontinuities in the surface brightness at the leading edge of subclusters in
merging clusters (e.g., Abell 3667), where the temperature drops sharply across
the fronts. These sharp edges are called cold fronts. We present results of
three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the interaction
between a dense subcluster plasma and ambient magnetized intracluster medium.
Anisotropic heat conduction along magnetic field lines is included. At the
initial state, magnetic fields are assumed to be uniform and transverse to the
motion of the dense subcluster. Since magnetic fields ahead of the subcluster
slip toward the third direction in the 3D case, the strength of magnetic fields
in this region can be reduced compared to that in the 2D case. Nevertheless, a
cold front can be maintained because the magnetic field lines wrapping around
the forehead of the subcluster suppress the heat conduction across them. On the
other hand, when the magnetic field is absent, a cold front cannot be
maintained because isotropic heat conduction from the hot ambient plasma
rapidly heats the cold subcluster plasma.",2005-04-09T20:17:50Z
Discovery of Oxygen Kalpha X-ray Emission from the Rings of Saturn,"Using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), the Chandra X-ray
Observatory (CXO) observed the Saturnian system for one rotation of the planet
(~37 ks) on 20 January, 2004, and again on 26-27 January, 2004. In this letter
we report the detection of X-ray emission from the rings of Saturn. The X-ray
spectrum from the rings is dominated by emission in a narrow (~130 eV wide)
energy band centered on the atomic oxygen K-alpha fluorescence line at 0.53
keV. The X-ray power emitted from the rings in the 0.49-0.62 keV band is 84 MW,
which is about one-third of that emitted from Saturn disk in the photon energy
range 0.24-2.0 keV. Our analysis also finds a clear detection of X-ray emission
from the rings in the 0.49-0.62 keV band in an earlier (14-15 April, 2003)
Chandra ACIS observation of Saturn. Fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays from
oxygen atoms in the H2O icy ring material is the likely source mechanism for
ring X-rays, consistent with the scenario of solar photo-production of a
tenuous ring oxygen atmosphere and ionosphere recently discovered by Cassini.",2005-05-19T14:13:24Z
Cosmological black holes as voids progenitors. I. Simulations,"Cosmological black holes (CBH), i.e. black holes with masses larger than
$10^{14} solar masses, have been proposed as possible progenitors of galaxy
voids (Stornaiolo 2002). The presence of a CBH in the central regions of a void
should induce significant gravitational lensing effects and in this paper we
discuss such gravitational signatures using simulated data. These signatures
may be summarized as follows: i) a blind spot in the projected position of the
CBH where no objects can be detected; ii) an excess of faint secondary images;
iii) an excess of double images having a characteristic angular separation. All
these signatures are shown to be detectable in future deep surveys.",2005-07-19T11:58:05Z
"The Photometric Performance and Calibration of the HST Advanced Camera
  For Surveys","We present the photometric calibration of the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS). We give here an overview of the performance and calibration of the 2 CCD
cameras, the Wide Field Channel (WFC) and the High Resolution Channel (HRC),
and a description of the best techniques for reducing ACS CCD data.
  On-orbit observations of spectrophotometric standard stars have been used to
revise the pre-launch estimate of the instrument response curves to best match
predicted and observed count rates. Synthetic photometry has been used to
determine zeropoints for all filters in 3 magnitude systems and to derive
interstellar extinction values for the ACS photometric systems.
  Due to the CCD internal scattering of long wavelength photons, the width of
the PSF increases significantly in the near-IR and the aperture correction for
photometry with near-IR filters depends on the spectral energy distribution of
the source. We provide encircled energy curves and a detailed recipe to correct
for the latter effect.
  Transformations between the ACS photometric systems and the UBVRI and WFPC2
systems are presented. In general, two sets of transformations are available: 1
based on the observation of 2 star clusters; the other on synthetic photometry.
We discuss the accuracy of these transformations and their sensitivity to
details of the spectra being transformed.
  Initial signs of detector degradation due to the HST radiative environment
are already visible. We discuss the impact on the data in terms of dark rate
increase, charge transfer inefficiency, and hot pixel population.",2005-07-26T18:10:45Z
"The complex velocity distribution of galaxies in Abell 1689:
  implications for mass modelling","The Abell 1689 galaxy cluster has recently become a subject of intensive
study. Thanks to its intermediate redshift (z=0.183) its mass distribution can
be reconstructed using numerous methods including gravitational lensing, galaxy
kinematics and X-ray imaging. The methods used to yield conflicting mass
estimates in the past and recently the cluster mass distribution has been
claimed to be in conflict with standard CDM scenarios due to rather large
concentration and steep mass profile obtained from detailed studies of
Broadhurst et al. using lensing. By studying in detail the kinematics of about
200 galaxies with measured redshifts in the vicinity of the cluster we show
that the cluster is probably surrounded by a few structures, quite distant from
each other, but aligned along the line of sight. We support our arguments by
referring to cosmological N-body simulations and showing explicitly that
distant, non-interacting haloes can produce entangled multi-peak line-of-sight
velocity distributions similar to that in A1689. We conclude that it is
difficult to estimate the cluster mass reliably from galaxy kinematics, but the
value we obtain after applying a simple cut-off in velocity agrees roughly with
the mass estimated from lensing. The complicated mass distribution around the
cluster may however increase the uncertainty in the determination of the
density profile shape obtained with weak lensing.",2005-07-21T12:13:29Z
The Dynamics of the Magnetoviscous Instability,"In dilute astrophysical plasmas, the collisional mean free path of a particle
can exceed its Larmor radius. Under these conditions, the thermal conductivity
and viscosity of the plasma can be dramatically altered. This alteration allows
outwardly decreasing angular velocity or temperature gradients to become
strongly destabilizing. This paper generalizes an earlier, simple analysis of
the viscosity instability, by including the dynamical effects of magnetic field
line tension. Such effects lower the growth rates found in the absence of such
tension, but still allow growth rates in excess of the maximum of the standard
magnetorotational instability. We find very good quantitative agreement with
more complex kinetic treatments of the same process. The combination of large
growth rates and large magnetic Prandtl number suggest that protogalactic disks
are powerful dynamos.",2005-04-29T16:24:14Z
"SN/GRB connection: a statistical approach with BATSE and Asiago
  Catalogues","Recent observations suggest that some types of GRB are physically connected
with SNe of type Ib/c. However, it has been pointed out by several authors that
some GRBs could be associated also with other types of core-collapse SNe (type
IIdw/IIn). On the basis of a comphrensive statistical study, which has made use
of the BATSE and Asiago catalogues, we have found that: i) the temporal and
spacial distribution of SNe-Ib/c is marginally correlated with that of the
BATSE GRBs; ii) we do not confirm the existence of an association between GRBs
and SNe-IIdw/IIn.",2005-05-03T11:39:15Z
The mass of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the missing satellite problem,"We present the results from a suite of N-body simulations of the tidal
stripping of two-component dwarf galaxies comprising some stars and dark
matter. We show that recent kinematic data from the local group dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies suggests that dSph galaxies must be sufficiently
massive ($10^9 - 10^{10}$M$_\odot$) that tidal stripping is of little
importance for the stars. We discuss the implications of these massive dSph
galaxies for cosmology and galaxy formation.",2005-05-11T10:55:30Z
The chemistry of high-mass star formation,"This paper reviews the chemistry of star-forming regions, with an emphasis on
the formation of high-mass stars. We first outline the basic molecular
processes in dense clouds, their implementation in chemical models, and
techniques to measure molecular abundances. Then, recent observational,
theoretical and laboratory developments are reviewed on the subjects of hot
molecular cores, cosmic-ray ionization, depletion and deuteration, and oxygen
chemistry. The paper concludes with a summary of outstanding problems and
future opportunities.",2005-06-07T15:23:59Z
Exploring Dark Energy with SNAP,"The accelerating expansion of the Universe is one of the most surprising and
potentially profound discoveries of modern cosmology. Measuring the
acceleration well enough to meaningfully constrain interesting physical models
requires improvements an order of magnitude beyond on-going and near-term
experiments. The Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) has been conceived as a
powerful yet simple experiment to use Type Ia supernovae and weak gravitational
lensing to reach this level of accuracy. As fundamentally different causes for
the acceleration map into very small differences in observational parameters
for all relevant cosmological methods, control of systematics is especially
important and so has been built into the SNAP mission design from the very
beginning.",2005-07-19T00:29:08Z
"SDSS J124058.03-015919.2: A new AM CVn star with a 37-minute orbital
  period","We present high time resolution VLT spectroscopy of SDSS J124058.03-015919.2,
a new helium-transferring binary star identified in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. We measure an orbital period of 37.355+/-0.002 minutes, confirming the
AM CVn nature of the system. From the velocity amplitudes of the accretor and
the accretion stream--disc impact, we derive a mass ratio q=0.039+/-0.010. Our
spectral coverage extends from 3700A--9500A and shows the presence of helium,
nitrogen, silicon and iron in the accretion disc, plus the redshifted,
low-velocity ""central spikes"" in the helium lines, known from the low-state AM
CVn stars GP Com and CE 315. Doppler tomography of the helium and silicon
emission lines reveals an unusual pattern of two bright emission sites in the
tomograms, instead of the usual one emission site identified with the impact of
the mass stream into the accretion disc. One of the two is preferred as the
conventional stream--disc impact point in velocity space, at the 3-sigma
confidence level. We speculate briefly on the origin of the second.",2005-05-17T21:17:47Z
"X-ray absorption lines suggest matter infalling onto the central
  black-hole of Mrk 509","Evidence for both red- and blue-shifted absorption lines due to ionized Fe in
the X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 509 are reported. These features
appear to be transient on time-scales as short as ~20 ks, and have been
observed with two different satellites, BeppoSAX and XMM-Newton. The red- and
blue-shifted lines are found at E~5.5 keV and ~8.1-8.3 keV (rest-frame),
respectively. The first is seen in one out of six BeppoSAX observations, the
latter is seen by both satellites. Under the assumption that the absorption is
due to either H- or He-like Iron, the implied velocities for the absorbing
matter are v~0.15-0.2 c, in both outward and inward directions. An alternative
explanation in terms of gravitational red-shift for the ~5.5 keV line cannot be
ruled out with the current data. We argue, however, that the temporal patterns
and sporadic nature of the lines are more easily reconciled with models which
predict important radial motions close to the central black hole, such as the
``aborted jet'' model, the ``thundercloud'' model, or magneto-hydrodynamical
models of jets and accretion-disks.",2005-06-28T14:17:15Z
Dynamical dark energy or variable cosmological parameters?,"One of the main aims in the next generation of precision cosmology
experiments will be an accurate determination of the equation of state (EOS)
for the dark energy (DE). If the latter is dynamical, the resulting barotropic
index \omega should exhibit a non-trivial evolution with the redshift. Usually
this is interpreted as a sign that the mechanism responsible for the DE is
related to some dynamical scalar field, and in some cases this field may behave
non-canonically (phantom field). Present observations seem to favor an evolving
DE with a potential phantom phase near our time. In the literature there is a
plethora of dynamical models trying to describe this behavior. Here we show
that the simplest option, namely a model with a variable cosmological term,
\Lambda=\Lambda(t), leads in general to a non-trivial effective EOS, with index
\omega_e, which may naturally account for these data features. We prove that in
this case there is always a ``crossing'' of the \omega_e=-1 barrier near our
time. We also show how this effect is modulated (or even completely controled)
by a variable Newton's constant G=G(t).",2005-07-05T18:47:23Z
A climatic thermostat making Earth habitable,"The mean surface temperature on Earth and other planets with atmospheres is
determined by the radiative balance between the non-reflected incoming solar
radiation and the outgoing long-wave black-body radiation from the atmosphere.
The surface temperature is higher than the black-body temperature due to the
greenhouse warming. Balancing the ice-albedo cooling and the greenhouse warming
gives rise to two stable climate states. A cold climate state with a
completelyice-covered planet, called Snowball Earth, and a warm state similar
to our present climate where greenhouse warming prevents the total glacition.
The warm state has dominated Earth in most of its geological history despite a
30 % fainter young Sun. The warming could have been controlled by a greenhouse
thermostat operating by temperature control of the weathering process depleting
the atmosphere from $CO_2$. This temperature control has permitted life to
evolve as early as the end of the heavy bombartment 4 billion years ago.",2005-05-12T09:39:35Z
The cooling of shock-compressed primordial gas,"We find that at redshifts z > 10, HD line cooling allows strongly-shocked
primordial gas to cool to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). This temperature is the minimum value attainable via radiative cooling.
Provided that the abundance of HD, normalized to the total number density,
exceeds a critical level of ~ 10^{-8}, the CMB temperature floor is reached in
a time which is short compared to the Hubble time. We estimate the
characteristic masses of stars formed out of shocked primordial gas in the wake
of the first supernovae, and resulting from the mergers of dark matter haloes
during hierarchical structure formation to be ~ 10 M_{solar}. In addition, we
show that cooling by HD enables the primordial gas in relic H II regions to
cool to temperatures considerably lower than those reached via H_2 cooling
alone. We confirm that HD cooling is unimportant in cases where the primordial
gas does not go through an ionized phase, as in the formation process of the
very first stars in z ~ 20 minihaloes of mass ~ 10^{6} M_{solar}.",2005-05-14T00:24:33Z
Branes in Supernova Shells,"This paper is firstly intended to review shortly the most recent developments
and ideas resulting from the necessity of having a scale at which gravitation
to unify the other fundamental forces. With the declared intention of
predicting an {\it in situ} distinct possibility for Kaluza-Klein gravitons
formation in the supernova shell we are using state of the art simulations
\citep{langer,ud1,ud2,ud3} for massive stellar winds to infer that the
supernova shock which will hit such winds will meet a non-isotropic and
non-homogeneous matter distribution with a very distinct geometry. By linking
this to the mechanism of particle shock acceleration at cosmic ray energies
(Fermi acceleration) and the related spallation in the wind shell, the result
is the creation of proper conditions for Kaluza-Klein gravitons formation in
the supernova shell from neutrino secondary particles (cosmic ray spallation
products) interacting with $\sim 10^{18}$ eV cosmic rays.",2005-05-25T11:24:47Z
"Abundances from disentangled component spectra: the eclipsing binary
  V578 Mon","Chemical abundances of the early-B type components of the binary V578 Mon are
derived from disentangled component spectra. This is a pilot study showing
that, even with moderately high line-broadening, metal abundances can be
derived from disentangled spectra with a precision 0.1 dex, relative to
sharp-lined single stars of the same spectral type. This binary is well-suited
for such an assessment because of its youth as a member of the Rosette Nebula
cluster NGC 2244, strengthening the expectation of an unevolved ZAMS chemical
composition. The method is of interest to study rotational driven mixing in
main-sequence stars, with fundamental stellar parameters known with higher
accuracy in (eclipsing) binaries. The paper also includes an evaluation of the
bias that might be present in disentangled spectra.",2005-04-20T12:53:46Z
Galaxy Morphology - Halo Gas Connections,"We studied a sample of 38 intermediate redshift MgII absorption-selected
galaxies using (1) Keck/HIRES and VLT/UVES quasar spectra to measure the halo
gas kinematics from MgII absorption profiles and (2) HST/WFPC-2 images to study
the absorbing galaxy morphologies. We have searched for correlations between
quantified gas absorption properties, and host galaxy impact parameters,
inclinations, position angles, and quantified morphological parameters. We
report a 3.2-sigma correlation between asymmetric perturbations in the host
galaxy morphology and the MgII absorption equivalent width. We suggest that
this correlation may indicate a connection between past merging and/or
interaction events in MgII absorption-selected galaxies and the velocity
dispersion and quantity of gas surrounding these galaxies.",2005-05-10T22:05:05Z
"G313.3+00.3: A New Planetary Nebula discovered by the Australia
  Telescope Compact Array and the Spitzer Space Telescope","We present a new planetary nebula, first identified in images from the
Australia Telescope Compact Array, although not recognized at that time. Recent
observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope during the GLIMPSE Legacy program
have rediscovered the object. The high-resolution radio and infrared images
enable the identification of the central star or its wind, the recognition of
the radio emission as thermal, and the probable presence of polycylic aromatic
hydrocarbons in and around the source. These lead to the conclusion that
G313.3+00.3 is a planetary nebula. This object is of particular interest
because it was discovered solely through radio and mid-infrared imaging,
without any optical (or near-infrared) confirmation, and acts as a proof of
concept for the discovery of many more highly extinguished planetary nebulae.
G313.3+00.3 is well-resolved by both the instruments with which it was
identified, and suffers extreme reddening due to its location in the
Scutum-Crux spiral arm.",2005-03-15T20:49:57Z
Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics,"The principles of Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics are disclosed leading to
a new way to interpret whole-Earth dynamics. Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics
incorporates elements of and unifies the two seemingly divergent dominant
theories of continential displacement, plate tectonics theory and Earth
expansion theory. Whole-Earth decompression is the consequence of Earth
formation from within a Jupiter-like protoplanet with subsequent loss of gases
and ices and concomitant rebounding. The initial whole-Earth decompression is
expected to result in a global system of major primary decompression cracks
appearing in the rigid crust which persist as the basalt feeders for the
global, mid-oceanic ridge system. As the Earth subsequently decompresses, the
area of the Earth's surface increases by the formation of secondary
decompression cracks, often located near the continental margins, presently
identified as oceanic trenches. These secondary decompression cracks are
subsequently in-filled with basalt, extruded from the mid-oceanic ridges, which
traverses the ocean floor by gravitational creep, ultimately plunging into
secondary decompression cracks, emulating subduction. Much of the evidence
presented in support of plate tectonics supports Whole-Earth Decompression
Dynamics, but without necessitating mantle convection/circulation or basalt

to the last 200 million years, the maximum age of the current ocean floor.",2005-06-30T20:24:21Z
"Late-time X-Ray, UV and Optical Monitoring of Supernova 1979C","We present results from observations of SN 1979C with XMM-Newton in X-rays
and in the UV, archival X-ray and HST data, and follow-up ground-based optical
imaging. The XMM-Newton MOS spectrum shows two-temperature thermal plasma
emission characteristics of both the forward (4.1 keV) and reverse shock (0.78
keV) with no intrinsic absorption. The long-term X-ray lightcurve of SN 1979C
shows no sign of a decline over 16-23 yrs after its outburst. The high X-ray
luminosity (8 x 10^38 ergs/s) is caused by the interaction of the shock with
dense circumstellar matter, likely deposited by a strong stellar wind from the
progenitor with a high mass-loss rate of 1.5 x 10^-4 M_sun/yr. The X-ray data
support a strongly decelerated shock and show a mass-loss rate history which is
consistent with a constant progenitor mass-loss rate and wind velocity over the
past >16,000 yrs in the evolution of the progenitor. We find a CSM density
profile of rho_CSM \propto r^-s with index s<1.7 and high CSM densities (>10^4
cm^-3) out to large radii from the site of the explosion (> 4 x 10^17 cm).
Using XMM-Newton Optical Monitor data we further detect optical/UV emission
from SN 1979C, with B, U, and UVW1-band lum. of 5,7, and 9 x 10^36 ergs/s. The
young stellar cluster in the vicinity of the SN, as imaged by the HST and
follow-up ground-based optical imaging, can only provide a fraction of the
total observed flux, so that a significant contribution to the output likely
arises from the strong interaction of SN 1979C with dense CSM.",2005-03-30T21:21:41Z
Monte Carlo radiative transfer in SPH density fields,"We combine a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code with an SPH code, so that --
assuming thermal equilibrium -- we can calculate dust-temperature fields,
spectral energy distributions, and isophotal maps, for the individual
time-frames generated by an SPH simulation. On large scales, the radiative
transfer cells (RT cells) are borrowed from the tree structure built by the SPH
code, and are chosen so that their size -- and hence the resolution of the
calculated temperature field -- is comparable with the resolution of the
density field. We refer collectively to these cubic RT cells as the 'global
grid'. The code is tested and found to treat externally illuminated dust
configurations very well. However, when there are embedded discrete sources,
i.e. stars, these produce very steep local temperature gradients which can only
be modelled properly if -- in the immediate vicinity of, and centred on, each
embedded star -- we supplement the global grid with a 'star grid' of closely
spaced concentric RT cells.",2005-05-13T15:23:53Z
Abundances on the Main Sequence of the Globular Cluster Omega Centauri,"Using the 2dF multi-fibre instrument on the AAT, moderate resolution spectra
have been obtained for a large sample of stars on the main sequence and at the
turnoff in the unusual globular cluster omega Centauri. We investigate the
behaviour of CH, CN and SrII line strength indices as a function of overall
abundance for the main sequence sample. A number of stars do not follow the
relations defined by the majority. These anomalous objects can be categorised
into (at least) three types. (1) Carbon enhanced stars, which represent about
5% of the sample, and which are found at all metallicities. Spectrum synthesis
calculations show that the atmospheres of these stars are typically enhanced in
C by factors of between 3 and 10. (2) Nitrogen enhanced stars, revealed for
[Fe/H] > -1.3 by strong CN indices, which make up ~40% of the cluster main
sequence population above this metallicity. These stars are enhanced in N by
factors of up to 100. Our data, however, provide no constraints of their
relative numbers at lower [Fe/H]. (3) Stars with enhancements of the s-process
element Sr by factors of 30 to 60. The possible origins for these abundance
anomalies are discussed.",2005-07-07T10:46:00Z
A CO Survey of Young Planetary Nebulae,"We report the results of a sensitive survey of young planetary nebulae in the
CO J=2-1 line that significantly increases the available data on warm, dense,
molecular gas in the early phases of planetary nebula formation. The
observations were made using the IRAM 30 m telescope with the 3 by 3 pixel
Heterodyne Receiver Array (HERA). The array provides an effective means of
discriminating the CO emission of planetary nebulae in the galactic plane from
contaminating emission of interstellar clouds along the line of sight. 110
planetary nebulae were observed in the survey and 40 were detected. The results
increase the number of young planetary nebulae with known CO emission by
approximately a factor of two. The CO spectra yield radial velocities for the
detected nebulae, about half of which have uncertain or no velocity
measurements at optical wavelengths. The CO profiles range from parabolic to
double-peaked, tracing the evolution of structure in the molecular gas. The
line widths are significantly larger than on the Asymptotic Giant Branch, and
many of the lines show extended wings, which probably result from the effects
on the envelopes of high velocity jets.",2005-06-03T22:31:21Z
The lives and deaths of positrons in the interstellar medium,"We reexamine in detail the various processes undergone by positrons in the
ISM from their birth to their annihilation using the most recent results of
positron interaction cross sections with H, H2 and He. The positrons' lives are
divided into two phases: the 'in-flight' phase and the thermal phase. The first
phase is treated with a Monte Carlo simulation that allows us to determine the
fraction of positrons that form positronium and annihilate as well as the
characteristics of the annihilation emission as a function of the medium
conditions. The second phase is treated with a binary reaction rate approach,
with cross sections adopted from experimental measurement or theoretical
calculations. An extensive search and update of the knowledge of positron
processes was thus undertaken. New reaction rates and line widths have been
obtained. We investigate the treatment of the complicated interactions between
positrons and interstellar dust grains. New reaction rates and widths of the
line resulting from the annihilation inside and outside of the grain have been
obtained. The final results of our calculations showed that dust is only
important in the hot phase of the ISM, where it dominates all other processes.
Combining the new calculations, we have constructed annihilation spectra for
each phase of the ISM, considering various grain contents, as well as an
overall combined spectrum for the ISM as a whole.",2005-04-07T18:37:05Z
"Dependence of the non-linear mass power spectrum on the equation of
  state of dark energy","We present N-body simulation calculations of the dependence of the power
spectrum of non-linear cosmological mass density fluctuations on the equation
of state of the dark energy, w=p/rho. At fixed linear theory power, increasing
w leads to an increase in non-linear power, with the effect increasing with k.
By k=10 h/Mpc, a model with w=-0.75 has ~12% more power than a standard
cosmological constant model (w=-1), while a model with w=-0.5 has ~33% extra
power (at z=0). The size of the effect increases with increasing dark energy
fraction, and to a lesser extent increasing power spectrum normalization, but
is insensitive to the power spectrum shape (the numbers above are for
Omega_m=0.281 and sigma_8=0.897). A code quantifying the non-linear effect of
varying w, as a function of k, z, and other cosmological parameters, which
should be accurate to a few percent for k<10 h/Mpc for models that fit the
current observations, is available at
http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pmcdonal/code.html. This paper also serves as an
example of a detailed exploration of the numerical convergence properties of
ratios of power spectra for different models, which can be useful because some
kinds of numerical error cancel in a ratio. When precision calculations based
on numerical simulations are needed for many different models, efficiency may
be gained by breaking the problem into a calculation of the absolute prediction
at a central point, and calculations of the relative change in the prediction
with model parameters.",2005-05-27T18:38:23Z
The Galex Ultraviolet Variability (GUVV) Catalog,"We present Version 1.0 of the NASA Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)
ultraviolet variability catalog (GUVV) that contains information on 84
time-variable and transient sources gained with simultaneous near and far
ultraviolet photometric observations. These time-variable sources were
serendipitously revealed in the various 1.2 degree star fields currently being
surveyed by the GALEX satellite in two ultraviolet bands (NUV 1750-2750A, FUV
1350-1750A) with limiting AB magnitudes of 23-25. The largest-amplitude
variable objects presently detected by GALEX are M-dwarf flare stars, which can
brighten by 5-10 mag in both the NUV and FUV bands during short duration (<
500s) outbursts. Other types of large-amplitude ultraviolet variable objects
include ab-type RR Lyrae stars, which can vary periodically by 2-5mag in the
GALEX FUV band. This first GUVV catalog lists galactic positions and possible
source identifications in order to provide the astronomical community with a
list of time-variable objects that can now be repeatedly observed at other
wavelengths. We expect the total number of time-variable source detections to
increase as the GALEX mission progresses, such that later version numbers of
the GUVV catalog will contain substantially more variable sources.",2005-04-21T21:57:27Z
Data Mining in Gamma Astrophysics Experiments,"Data mining techniques, including clustering and classification tasks, for
the automatic information extraction from large datasets are increasingly
demanded in several scientific fields. In particular, in the astrophysical
field, large archives and digital sky surveys with dimensions of 10E12 bytes
currently exist, while in the near future they will reach sizes of the order of
10E15. In this work we propose a multidimensional indexing method to
efficiently query and mine large astrophysical datasets. A novelty detection
algorithm, based on the Support Vector Clustering and using density and
neighborhood information stored in the index structure, is proposed to find
regions of interest in data characterized by isotropic noise. We show an
application of this method for the detection of point sources from a gamma-ray
photon list.",2005-03-24T15:23:27Z
Hydrogen Burning of 17-O in Classical Novae,"We report on the observation of a previously unknown resonance at
E=194.1+/-0.6 keV (lab) in the 17-O(p,alpha)14-N reaction, with a measured
resonance strength omega_gamma(p,alpha)=1.6+/-0.2 meV. We studied in the same
experiment the 17-O(p,gamma)18-F reaction by an activation method and the
resonance-strength ratio was found to be
omega_gamma(p,alpha)/omega_gamma(p,gamma)=470+/-50. The corresponding
excitation energy in the 18-F compound nucleus was determined to be
5789.8+/-0.3 keV by gamma-ray measurements using the 14-N(alpha,gamma)18-F
reaction. These new resonance properties have important consequences for 17-O
nucleosynthesis and gamma-ray astronomy of classical novae.",2005-06-21T17:05:19Z
The Spatial Distribution of Metals in the Intergalactic Medium,"We investigate the impact of environment on the metallicity of the diffuse
intergalactic medium. We use pixel correlation techniques to search for weak
CIV and OVI absorption in the spectrum of quasar Q1422+231 in regions of the
spectrum close to and far from galaxies at z ~ 3. This is achieved both by
using the positions of observed Lyman break galaxies and by using strong CIV
absorption as a proxy for the presence of galaxies near the line of sight. We
find that the metal line absorption is a strong function of not only the HI
optical depth (and thus gas density) but also proximity to highly enriched
regions (and so proximity to galaxies). The parameter ``proximity to galaxies''
can account for some, but not all, of the scatter in the strength of CIV
absorption for fixed HI. Finally, we find that even if we limit our analysis to
the two thirds of the pixels that are at least 600 km/s from any CIV line that
is strong enough to detect unambiguously (tau_CIV > 0.1), our statistical
analysis reveals only slightly less CIV for fixed HI than when we analyze the
whole spectrum. We conclude that while the metallicity is enhanced in regions
close to (Lyman-break) galaxies, the enrichment is likely to be much more
widespread than their immediate surroundings.",2005-07-04T20:22:12Z
Diffraction Analysis of 2-D Pupil Mapping for High-Contrast Imaging,"Pupil-mapping is a technique whereby a uniformly-illuminated input pupil,
such as from starlight, can be mapped into a non-uniformly illuminated exit
pupil, such that the image formed from this pupil will have suppressed
sidelobes, many orders of magnitude weaker than classical Airy ring
intensities. Pupil mapping is therefore a candidate technique for coronagraphic
imaging of extrasolar planets around nearby stars. Unlike most other
high-contrast imaging techniques, pupil mapping is lossless and preserves the
full angular resolution of the collecting telescope. So, it could possibly give
the highest signal-to-noise ratio of any proposed single-telescope system for
detecting extrasolar planets. Prior analyses based on pupil-to-pupil
ray-tracing indicate that a planet fainter than 10^{-10} times its parent star,
and as close as about 2 lambda/D, should be detectable. In this paper, we
describe the results of careful diffraction analysis of pupil mapping systems.
These results reveal a serious unresolved issue. Namely, high-contrast pupil
mappings distribute light from very near the edge of the first pupil to a broad
area of the second pupil and this dramatically amplifies diffraction-based edge
effects resulting in a limiting attainable contrast of about 10^{-5}. We hope
that by identifying this problem others will provide a solution.",2005-06-22T22:20:25Z
"Lorentz violation at high energy: concepts, phenomena and astrophysical
  constraints","We consider here the possibility of quantum gravity induced violation of
Lorentz symmetry (LV). Even if suppressed by the inverse Planck mass such LV
can be tested by current experiments and astrophysical observations. We review
the effective field theory approach to describing LV, the issue of naturalness,
and many phenomena characteristic of LV. We discuss some of the current
observational bounds on LV, focusing mostly on those from high energy
astrophysics in the QED sector at order E/M_Planck. In this context we present
a number of new results which include the explicit computation of rates of the
most relevant LV processes, the derivation of a new photon decay constraint,
and modification of previous constraints taking proper account of the helicity
dependence of the LV parameters implied by effective field theory.",2005-05-12T19:55:28Z
"The Optical - Infrared Colors of CORALS QSOs: Searching for Dust
  Reddening Associated With High Redshift Damped Lyman Alpha Systems","The presence of dust in quasar absorbers, such as damped Lyman alpha (DLA)
systems, may cause the background QSO to appear reddened. We investigate the
extent of this potential reddening by comparing the optical-to-infrared (IR)
colors of QSOs with and without intervening absorbers. Our QSO sample is based
on the Complete Optical and Radio Absorption Line System (CORALS) survey of
Ellison et al (2001). We have obtained near-simultaneous B and K band
magnitudes for subset of the CORALS sample and supplemented our observations
with further measurements published in the literature. To account for
redshift-related color changes, the B-K colors are normalized using the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) QSO composite. The mean normalized B-K color of the
DLA sub-sample is +0.12, whereas the mean for the no-DLA sample is -0.10; both
distributions have RMS scatters ~0.5. Neither a student's T-test nor a KS test
indicate that there is any significant difference between the two color
distributions. Based on simulations which redden the colors of QSOs with
intervening DLAs, we determine a reddening limit which corresponds to E(B-V) <
0.04 (SMC-like extinction) at 99% confidence (3 sigma), assuming that E(B-V) is
the same for all DLAs. Finally, we do not find any general correlation between
absorber properties (such as [Fe/Zn] or neutral hydrogen column density) and
B-K color. One of these two QSOs shows evidence for strong associated
absorption from X-ray observations, an alternative explanation for its very red
color. We conclude that the presence of intervening galaxies causes a minimal
reddening of the background QSO.",2005-07-18T20:05:30Z
"Robust determination of optical path difference: fringe tracking at the
  IOTA interferometer","We describe the fringe packet tracking system used to equalise the optical
path lengths at the Infrared Optical Telescope Array (IOTA) interferometer. The
measurement of closure phases requires obtaining fringes on three baselines
simultaneously. This is accomplished using an algorithm based on double Fourier
interferometry for obtaining the wavelength-dependent phase of the fringes and
a group delay tracking algorithm for determining the position of the fringe
packet. The comparison between data acquired with and without the fringe packet
tracker shows about a factor 3 reduction of the error on the closure-phase
measurement. The fringe packet tracker has been able so far to track fringes of
signal-to-noise as low as 1.8 for stars as faint as mH=7.0.",2005-04-05T21:23:01Z

"Two-temperature accretion flows in magnetic cataclysmic variables:
  Structures of post-shock emission regions and X-ray spectroscopy","We use a two-temperature hydrodynamical formulation to determine the
temperature and density structures of the post-shock accretion flows in
magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) and calculate the corresponding X-ray
spectra. The effects of two-temperature flows are significant for systems with
a massive white dwarf and a strong white-dwarf magnetic field. Our calculations
show that two-temperature flows predict harder keV spectra than one-temperature
flows for the same white-dwarf mass and magnetic field. This result is
insensitive to whether the electrons and ions have equal temperature at the
shock but depends on the electron-ion exchange rate, relative to the rate of
radiative loss along the flow. White-dwarf masses obtained by fitting the X-ray
spectra of mCVs using hydrodynamic models including the two-temperature effects
will be lower than those obtained using single-temperature models. The bias is
more severe for systems with a massive white dwarf.",2005-04-12T11:08:55Z
Precise reddening and metallicity of NGC6752 from FLAMES spectra,"(abridged) Accurate reddenings for Globular Clusters could be obtained by
comparing the colour-temperature obtained using temperatures from
reddening-free indicator (Halpha), with that given by standard
colour-temperature calibrations. From a single 1300 seconds exposure with
FLAMES at VLT2 we obtained spectra centred on Halpha (R=6000, 5<S/N<50) for 120
stars near the turn-off of NGC6752. This set of spectra was used to derive
effective temperatures from fittings of Halpha profiles with typical errors of
about +/- 200 K and reddening estimates with individual errors of 0.05 mag.
Averaging all individual reddenings, a high precision reddening estimate has
been obtained for the cluster: E(B-V)=0.046 +/- 0.005. The same exposure
provided UVES spectra of seven stars near the red giant branch bump (R=40000,
20<S/N<40) that provided Fe abundances with internal errors of 0.026 dex, and
with average metallicity [Fe/H]= -1.48 +/- 0.01 +/- 0.06 dex (random +
systematic). Abundances were obtained for several other elements, allowing e.g.
an accurate estimate of the ratio between the alpha-elements and Fe
([alpha/Fe]=+0.27 +/- 0.01). The O-Na anticorrelation is evident from our UVES
data, in agreement with past results. This analysis shows the power of FLAMES
for analysis of globular clusters: the accurate reddenings and metal abundances
obtained by a procedure like that described here, combined with distance
determinations from cluster dynamics or main sequence fitting, and high quality
colour-magnitude diagrams, could allow derivation of ages with errors below 1
Gyr for individual globular clusters.",2005-05-10T16:35:36Z
Search for Planetary Candidates within the OGLE Stars,"We propose a method to distinguish between planetary and stellar companions
to stars which present a periodic decrease in brightness, interpreted as a
transit. Light curves from a total of 177 stars from the OGLE project were
fitted by the model which simulates planetary transits using an opaque disk in
front of an image of the Sun. The simulation results yield the orbital radius
in units of stellar radii, the orbital inclination angle, and the ratio of the
planet to the star radii. Combining Kepler's third law with a mass-radius
relation for main sequence stars, it was possible to estimate values for the
masses and radii of both the primary and secondary objects. This model was
successfully tested with the confirmed planets orbiting the stars HD 209458,
TrES-1, OGLE-TR-10, 56, 111, 113, and 132. The method consists of selecting as
planetary candidates only those objects with primary densities between 0.7 and
2.3 solar densities (F, G, and K stars) and secondaries with radius less than
1.5 Jupiter radius. The method is not able to distinguish between a planet and
a dwarf star with mass less than 0.1 $M_\odot$, such as OGLE-TR-122. We propose
a selection of 28 planetary candidates (OGLE-TR-49, 51, 55, 63, 71, 76, 90, 97,
100, 109, 114, 127, 130, 131, 134, 138, 140, 146, 151, 155, 159, 164, 165, 169,
170, 171, 172, and 174) for high resolution spectroscopy follow up.",2005-05-13T12:04:38Z
"Models for Achromatic Light-Curve Breaks in GRB Afterglows: Jets,
  Structured Outflows, and Energy Injection","The steepening (break) of the power-law fall-off observed in the optical
emission of some GRB afterglows at epoch ~1 day is often attributed to a
collimated outflow (jet), undergoing lateral spreading. Wider opening GRB
ejecta with a non-uniform energy angular distribution (structured outflows) or
the cessation of energy injection in the afterglow can also yield light-curve
breaks.
  We determine the optical and X-ray light-curve decay indices and spectral
energy distribution slopes for 10 GRB afterglows with optical light-curve
breaks (980519, 990123, 990510, 991216, 000301, 000926, 010222, 011211, 020813,
030226), and use these properties to test the above models for light-curve
steepening. It is found that the optical breaks of six of these afterglows can
be accommodated by either energy injection or by structured outflows. In the
refreshed shock model, a wind-like stratification of the circumburst medium (as
expected for massive stars as GRB progenitors) is slightly favoured. A
spreading jet interacting with a homogeneous circumburst medium is required by
the afterglows 990510, 000301, 011211, and 030226. The optical pre- and
post-break decays of these four afterglows are incompatible with a wind-like
medium.
  The current sample of 10 afterglows with breaks suggests that the
distribution of the break magnitude (defined as the increase of the afterglow
decay exponent) is bimodal, with a gap at 1. If true, this bimodality favours
the structured outflow model, while the gap location indicates a homogeneous
circumburst environment.",2005-06-23T22:48:20Z
"Heteroclinic orbit and tracking attractor in cosmological model with a
  double exponential potential","In this paper, the dynamical heteroclinic orbit and attractor have been
employed to make the late-time behaviors of the model insensitive to the
initial condition and thus alleviates the fine tuning problem in cosmological
dynamical system of barotropic fluid and quintessence with a double exponential
potential. The late-time asymptotic behavior of the double exponential model
does not always correspond to the single case. The heteroclinic orbits are the
non-stationary solutions and in general they will interpolate between the
critical points. Although they can not be shown analytically, yet a numerical
calculation can reveal most of their properties. Varied heteroclinic orbits and
attractors including tracking attractor and de Sitter attractor have been
found.",2005-08-01T02:48:14Z
The Plerionic Supernova Remnant G21.5-0.9: In and Out,"The absence of a supernova remnant (SNR) shell surrounding the Crab and other
plerions (pulsar wind nebulae) has been a mystery for 3 decades. G21.5-0.9 is a
particularly intriguing plerionic SNR in which the central powering engine is
not yet detected. Early Chandra observations revealed a faint extended X-ray
halo which was suggested to be associated with the SNR shell; however its
spectrum was nonthermal, unlike what is expected from an SNR shell. On the
other hand, a plerionic origin to the halo is problematic since the X-ray
plerion would be larger than the radio plerion. We present here our analysis of
an integrated 245 ksec of archival Chandra data acquired with the
High-Resolution Camera (HRC) and 520 ksec acquired with the Advanced CCD
Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). This study provides the deepest and highest
resolution images obtained to date. The resulting images reveal for the first
time 1) a limb-brightened morphology in the eastern section of the halo, and 2)
a rich structure in the inner (40""-radius) bright plerion including wisps and a
double-lobed morphology with an axis of symmetry running in the
northwest-southeast direction. Our spatially resolved spectroscopic study of
the ACIS-I data indicates that the photon index steepens with increasing
distance from the central point source out to a radius of 40"" then becomes
constant at ~2.4 in the X-ray halo (for a column density N_H=2.2E22/cm^2). No
line emission was found from the eastern limb; however marginal evidence for
line emission in the halo's northern knots was found. This study illustrates
the need for deep Chandra observations to reveal the missing SNR material in
Crab-like plerions.",2005-04-17T22:59:42Z
Core and Conal Component Analysis of Pulsar B1237+25,"The paper provides a new analysis of this famous five-component ({\bf M})
pulsar. In addition to the star's core-active ``abnormal'' mode, we find two
distinct behaviors within its ``normal'' mode, a ``quiet-normal'' mode with
regular 2.8-period subpulse modulation and little or no core activity, and a
``flare-normal'' mode, where the core is regularly bright and a nearly 4-period
modulation is maintained. The ``flare-normal'' mode appears to be an
intermediate state between the ``quiet normal'' and ``abnormal'' behaviors.
Short 5--15-pulse ``flare-normal''-mode ``bursts'' and ``quiet normal''
intervals alternate with each other quasi-periodically, making a cycle some
60--80 pulses in duration. ``Abnormal''-mode intervals are interspersed within
this overall cycle, usually persisting for only a few pulses, but occasionally
lasting for scores or even many hundreds of pulses. Within subsequences where
the core is exceptionally quiet, the pulsar provides a nearly ``textbook''
example of a central PA sightline traverse--with a PA rate measured to be at
least some 180$\deg/\deg$. On this basis it is shown that the sightline impact
angle $\beta$ must be about 0.25\degr or some 5% of the outer conal beam
radius. The star's core component is found to be incomplete, despite the fact
that the core's full antisymmetric circularly polarized signature is present.
We find that the star's PA traverse is disrupted through the action of
orthogonally polarized linear power in the longitude range of the core
component. This behavior is modeled to show its effect. Finally, the star
provides two well defined fiducial points from which emission-height estimates
can be computed, the respective centers of both the linear PA traverse and the
zero-crossing point of the circular polarization signature.",2005-06-30T20:56:02Z
Intra-night Optical Variability of Luminous Radio Quiet QSOs,"In the present paper we report the detection of intra-night variability in
some of the RQQSOs and one LDQ. To study intra-night variability, we carried
out photometric monitoring of seven RQQSOs and one LDQ in Johnson V-passband
using 1.2 meter optical/IR telescope at Gurushikhar, Mount Abu, India.
Observations were made in nine nights during the first half of the year 2000;
seven RQQSOs: 0748+291, 0945+438, 1017+280, 1029+329, 1101+319, 1225+317,
1252+020 and one LDQ: 1103-006 were observed. RQQSOs 0748+291, 1225+317 and LDQ
1103-006 have shown existence of intra-night variations. In the case of
1017+280 (RQQSO) there is indication of intra-night variation in one night
where as the observations in another night do not show convincingly the
existence of intra-night variability. RQQSOs 0945+438, 1029+329, 1101+319 and
1252+020 have not shown any intra-night variations. We compiled intra-night
variability data for radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs from the literature for
statistical analysis. It is found that a good fraction of radio-quiet AGNs show
intra-night variations with the maximum amplitude of variation being about 10%.
On the other hand blazars show at times intra-night flux variability up to
100%. In case of radio-loud AGNs (excluding blazars), maximum amplitude of
intra-night variation lies between the variability amplitude of radio-quiet
AGNs and blazars i.e. the flux variation is close to 50%. The results indicate
that the energy generation mechanism and the environment around the central
engine in different classes of AGNs may be similar, if not identical. The
standard model for radio-loud AGNs, where shocks are propagating down
relativistic jet or models based on disturbances in accretion disks can also

The Progenitor of Supernova 2004dj in a Star Cluster,"The progenitor of type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2004dj is identified with a
supergiant in a compact star cluster known as ""Sandage Star 96"" (S96) in the
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2403, which was fortuitously imaged as part of the
Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey from Feb 1995
to Dec 2003 prior to SN 2004dj. The superior photometry of BATC images for S96,
taken with 14 intermediate-band filters covering 3000-10000\AA, unambiguously
establishes the star cluster nature of S96 with an age of $\sim 20$Myr, a
reddening of $\hbox{E}(B-V)\sim 0.35$ mag and a total mass of $\sim
96,000$M$_{\odot}$. The compact star cluster nature of S96 is also consistent
with the lack of light variations in the past decade. The SN progenitor is
estimated to have a main-sequence mass of $\sim$12M$_{\odot}$. The comparison
of our intermediate-band data of S96 with the post-outburst photometry obtained
as the SN has significantly dimmed, may hopefully conclusively establish the
nature of the progenitor.",2005-05-14T01:22:06Z
Lopsided spiral galaxies: evidence for gas accretion,"We quantify the degree of lopsidedness for a sample of 149 galaxies observed
in the near-infrared from the OSUBGS sample, and try to explain the physical
origin for the observed disk lopsidedness. We confirm previous studies, but now
for a larger sample, that a large fraction of galaxies show significant
lopsidedness in their stellar disks, measured as the Fourier amplitude of the
m=1 component, normalised to the average or m=0 component, in the surface
density. Late-type galaxies are found to be more lopsided, while the presence
of m=2 spiral arms and bars is correlated. The m=1 amplitude is found to be
uncorrelated with the tidal forces acting on a galaxy via nearby companions.
Numerical simulations are carried out to study the generation of m=1 via
different processes: galaxy tidal encounters, galaxy mergers, and external gas
accretion and subsequent star formation. The simulations show that galaxy
interactions and mergers can trigger strong lopsidedness, but do not explain
several independent statistical properties of observed galaxies. To explain all
the observational results, it is required that a large fraction of lopsidedness
results from cosmological accretion of gas on galactic disks, which can create
strongly lopsided disks when this accretion is asymmetrical enough.",2005-03-15T12:33:33Z
Molecular Hydrogen Excitation around Active Galactic Nuclei,"We report R~3000 VLT ISAAC K-band spectroscopy of the nuclei (i.e. central
100-300pc) of 9 galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus. For 5 of these we
also present spectra of the circumnuclear region out to 1kpc. We have measured
a number of H_2 lines in the v=1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 vibrational transitions, as
well as the Br_gamma and HeI recombination lines, and the NaI stellar
absorption. Although only 3 of the galaxies are classified as Seyfert 1s in the
literature, broad Br_gamma (FWHM 1000kms) is seen in 7 of the objects. The
v=1-0 emission appears thermalised at T~1000K. However, the v=2-1 and 3-2
emission show evidence of being radiatively excited by far-UV photons. The PDR
models that fit the data best are, as for the ultraluminous infrared galaxies
in Davies et al. (2003), those for which the H_2 emission arises in dense
clouds illuminated by intense FUV radiation. The NaI stellar absorption is
clearly seen in 6 of the nuclear spectra, indicating the presence of a
significant population of late type stars. It is possible that these stars are
a result of the same episode of star formation that gave rise to the stars
heating the PDRs. It seems unlikely that the AGN is the dominant source of
excitation for the near infrared H_2 emission: in two nuclei H_2 was not
detected at all, and in general we find no evidence of suppression of the
2-1S(3) line, which may occur in X-ray irradiated gas. Our data do not reveal
any significant difference between the nuclear and circumnuclear line ratios,
suggesting that the physical conditions of the dominant excitation mechanism
are similar both near the AGN and in the larger scale environment around it,
and that star formation is an important process even in the central 100pc
acround AGN.",2005-07-04T11:46:32Z
"Elliptical Galaxies with Emission Lines from the Sloan Digital Sky
  Survey","We present the results of 11 elliptical galaxies with strong nebular emission
lines during our study of star formation history along the Hubble sequence.
After removing the dilution from the underlying old stellar populations by use
of stellar population synthesis model, we derive the accurate fluxes of all
emission lines for these objects, which are later classified with emission line
ratios into one Seyfert 2, six LINERs and four HII galaxies. We also identify
one HII galaxy (A1216+04) as a hitherto unknown Wolf-Rayet galaxy from the
presence of the Wolf-Rayet broad bump at 4650 \AA. We propose that the
star-forming activities in elliptical galaxies are triggered by either
galaxy-galaxy interaction or the merging of a small satellite/a massive star
cluster, as already suggested by recent numerical simulations.",2005-07-11T10:17:00Z
"Cosmological Three-Point Function: Testing The Halo Model Against
  Simulations","We perform detailed comparison of the semi-analytic halo model predictions
with measurements in numerical simulations of the two and three point
correlation functions (3PCF), as well as power spectrum and bispectrum. We
discuss the accuracy and self-consistency of the halo model description of
gravitational clustering in the non-linear regime and constrain halo model
parameters. We exploit the recently proposed multipole expansion of three point
statistics that expresses rotation invariance in the most natural way. This not
only offers technical advantages by reducing the integrals required for the
halo model predictions, but amounts to a convenient way of compressing the
information contained in the 3PCF. We find that, with an appropriate choice of
the halo boundary and mass function cut-off, halo model predictions are in good
agreement with the bispectrum measured in numerical simulations. However, the
halo model predicts less than the observed configuration dependence of the 3PCF
on ~ Mpc scales. This effect is mainly due to quadrupole moment deficit,
possibly related to the assumption of spherical halo geometry. Our analysis
shows that using its harmonic decomposition, the full configuration dependence
of the 3PCF in the non-linear regime can be compressed into just a few numbers,
the lowest multipoles. Moreover, these multipoles are closely related to the
highest signal to noise eigenmodes of the 3PCF. Therefore this estimator may
simplify future analyses aimed at constraining cosmological and halo model
parameters from observational data.",2005-04-13T20:01:19Z
"The nature of Composite Seyfert/Star-forming galaxies revealed by X-ray
  observations","This paper presents new Chandra and BeppoSAX observations aimed at
investigating the optical/X-ray mismatch in the enigmatic class of the
Composite galaxies, discovered by a cross-correlation of IRAS and ROSAT all sky
survey catalogues. These galaxies have been classified as star-forming objects
on the basis of their optical spectra, while the detection of weak broad wings
in the H(alpha) emission in a few of them and their high X-ray luminosity in
the ROSAT band indicated the presence of an active nucleus. The analysis of
Chandra observations for 4 Composites has revealed nuclear point-like sources,
with a typical AGN spectrum (Gamma = 1.7-1.9) and little intrinsic absorption.
A strong flux variability has been observed on different time scales, in
particular most of the sources were brighter at the ROSAT epoch. Although of
relative low luminosity for the AGN class (L(2-10 keV) = 3-60 x 10^{41} erg/s),
the active nucleus is nevertheless dominant in the X-ray domain. At other
wavelengths it appears to be overwhelmed by the starburst and/or host galaxy
light, yielding the Composite classification for these objects.",2005-06-06T13:13:40Z
New optical polarization measurements of quasi-stellar objects. The data,"New linear polarization measurements (mainly in the V band) are presented for
203 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). The sample is made up of 94 QSOs located in
the North Galactic Pole (NGP) region and of 109 QSOs in the South Galactic Pole
(SGP) region. First time measurements have been obtained for 184 QSOs. Among
them, 109 known radio-emitters, 42 known Broad Absorption Line (BAL) QSOs, and
1 gravitationally lensed quasi-stellar object. We found high polarization
levels (p > 3%) for 12 QSOs, including the BAL QSO SDSS J1409+0048. For 10
objects, measurements obtained at different epochs do exist. Two of them show
evidence for variability: the highly polarized BL Lac candidate PKS 1216-010
and the radio source PKS 1222+037",2005-07-01T13:34:00Z
"Constraints on dark energy from the observed density fluctuations
  spectrum and supernova data","One of the greatest challenges in cosmology today is to determine the nature
of dark energy, the source of the observed present acceleration of the
universe. High precision experiments are being developed to reduce the
uncertainties in the observations. Recently, we showed that the agreement to an
accuracy of 10% of measurements of the present density fluctuations
(\delta\rho/\rho)^2, derived from galaxy distribution (GD) data and cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in the \LambdaCDM model, puts very
strong limits on the possible decay of the vacuum energy into cold dark matter.
Using this agreement, combined with the evidence that the matter density
\Omega_M^0=0.28\pm 0.02 and that the universe is approximately flat, we show
that the vacuum metamorphosis model (VMM) and the popular brane-world model
(BWM), both used to explain dark energy, can be discarded. When we relax the
\Omega_M^0 requirement, we find that an agreement within 10% can be obtained
only with \Omega_M^0\simeq 0.36 for the VMM and \Omega_M^0\simeq 0.73 for the
BWM, both of which are not consistent with observations. The agreement of the
CMB and GD data and previous constraints from SNIa data exclude, or put strong
limits on, other dark energy models, which have been suggested, that can be
described by the parametrized equation of state (EOS) w=p/\rho= w_0 + w_a(1-a),
where w_0 and w_a are constants, a is the cosmological scale factor and p
(\rho) is the pressure (energy density) of the dark energy. We find that the
supergravity (SUGRA) model with w_0=-0.82 and w_a=0.58 can be discarded. In
general, we find best values -1.86<w_0<-1.72 with 1.53<w_a<2.0. For redshifts
z\sim 0.5-1, where the supernova data is sensitive, w\sim -1 for this
parametrized EOS.",2005-05-23T15:22:43Z
Pulsating stars in the ASAS-3 database. I. Beta Cephei stars,"We present results of an analysis of the ASAS-3 data for short-period
variables from the recently published catalogue of over 38 000 stars. Using the
data available in the literature we verify the results of the automatic
classification related to $\beta$ Cephei pulsators. In particular, we find that
14 stars in the catalogue can be classified unambiguously as new $\beta$ Cephei
stars. By means of periodogram analysis we derive the frequencies and
amplitudes of the excited modes. The main modes in the new $\beta$ Cephei stars
have large semi-amplitudes, between 35 and 80 mmag. Up to four modes were found
in some stars. Two (maybe three) new $\beta$ Cephei stars are members of
southern young open clusters: ASAS 164409-4719.1 belongs to NGC 6200, ASAS
164630-4701.2 is a member of Hogg 22, and ASAS 164939-4431.7 could be a member
of NGC 6216.
  We also analyze the photometry of four known $\beta$ Cephei stars in the
ASAS-3 catalogue, namely IL Vel, NSV 24078, V1449 Aql and SY Equ. Finally, we
discuss the distribution of $\beta$ Cephei stars in the Galaxy.",2005-06-14T17:12:02Z
A Deep Infrared Search for AXP 1E 1841-045,"Multi-colour (JHKs) imaging and photometry of the field of the Anomalous
X-ray Pulsar AXP 1E 1841-045 is analysed in the light of new, accurate
coordinates from Chandra (Wachter et al, 2004). From excellentquality images,
we find multiple sources in and around the position error circle. Of these,
none can be confidently identified as the infrared counterpart. The limiting
magnitudes reached were J=22.1, H=20.7 and Ks=19.9$ (95% confidence).",2005-06-13T19:39:52Z
Dark Energy Condensation,"The two most popular candidates for dark energy, i.e. a cosmological constant
and quintessence, are very difficult to distinguish observationally, mostly
because the quintessence field does not have sizable fluctuations. We study a
scalar field model for dark energy in which the scalar field is invariant under
reflection symmetry, phi -> -phi. Under general assumptions, there is a phase
transition at late times (z < 0.5). Before the phase transition, the field
behaves as a cosmological constant. After the phase transition, a
time-dependent scalar condensate forms, the field couples with dark matter and
develops sizable perturbations tracking those of dark matter. The background
cosmological evolution is in agreement with existing observations, but might be
distinguished from that of a cosmological constant by future Supernovae
surveys. The growth of cosmological perturbations carries the imprint of the
phase transition, however a non-linear approach has to be developed in order to
study it quantitatively.",2005-05-31T10:05:55Z
"INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton observations of the low-luminosity and X-ray
  rich burst GRB 040223","GRB 040223 was observed by INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton. GRB 040223 has a peak
flux of (1.6+/-0.13) x10^-8 ergs cm^-2 s^-1, a fluence of (4.4+/-0.4)x10^-7
ergs cm^-2 and a steep photon power law index of -2.3+/-0.2, in the energy
range 20-200 keV. The steep spectrum implies it is an x- ray rich GRB with
emission up to 200 keV and E_peak < 20 keV. If E_peak is < 10 keV, it would
qualify as an x-ray flash with high energy emission. The x-ray data has a
spectral index beta_x = -1.7+/-0.2, a temporal decay of t^(-0.75+/-0.25) and a
large column density of (1.8 x 10^22) cm^-2. The luminosity-lag relationship
was used to obtain a redshift (z = 0.1+0.04-0.02). The isotropic energy
radiated in gamma-rays and x-ray luminosity after 10 hours are factors of 1000
and 100 less than classical GRBs. GRB 040223 is consistent with the
extrapolation of the Amati relation into the region that includes XRF 030723
and XRF 020903.",2005-05-17T17:51:48Z
Fast outflow of neutral and ionized gas from the radio galaxy 3C 293,"We detect a fast outflow of neutral and ionized gas with velocities up to
about 1000 km/s from the central region of radio galaxy 3C 293. With optical
spectroscopy we locate the bulk of the ionized gas outflow at the position of a
bright radio hot-spot in the inner radio jet, about 1 kpc east of the nucleus.
Given the presence of large amounts of cold gas and the distorted morphology of
the radio jet in this region, we argue that the ISM is pushed out by a severe
interaction with the radio plasma. The similarity of the outflow of HI with the
ionized gas outflow that we see at the position of the radio hot-spot suggests
that despite the high energies involved in the jet-ISM interaction, part of the
gas stays, or becomes again, neutral. In this paper we also present the
detection of HI emission in three nearby companions of 3C 293.",2005-06-16T18:36:30Z

"Soft X-ray Transmission Spectroscopy of Warm/Hot Intergalactic Medium
  with XEUS","We discuss the detectability of Warm/Hot Intergalactic medium (WHIM) via the
absorption lines toward bright point sources with a future X-ray satellite
mission, XEUS. While we consider bright QSOs as specific examples, the
methodology can be applied to bright GRB afterglows. We create mock absorption
spectra for bright QSOs (more than 20 QSOs over the all sky) using a light-cone
output of a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. We assume that WHIM is under
collisional and photo-ionization equilibrium. If WHIM has a constant
metallicity of $Z=0.1Z_\odot$, approximately 2 O{\sc vii} absorption line
system with $>3\sigma$ will be detected on average along a random line-of-sight
toward bright QSOs up to $z=0.3$ for 30 ksec exposure.",2005-04-27T10:49:36Z
Properties of five low-contrast open clusters in the third quadrant,"We derive photometric, structural and dynamical evolution-related parameters
of five as yet unstudied low-contrast open clusters located in the third
quadrant using 2MASS data. The target clusters are Czernik 31, Czernik 32,
Haffner 9, Haffner 11 and Trumpler 13. We apply a statistical field-star
decontamination procedure to infer on the intrinsic CMD morphology which is
critical for such low-contrast objects. Consequently, it became possible to
derive accurate reddening, age, distance from the Sun and Galactocentric
distance for the five clusters. In the structural and luminosity/mass-function
analyses we apply a colour-magnitude filter which encompasses the cluster
evolutionary CMD sequences and excludes stars with discrepant colours. Using
this procedure we derive core and limiting radii, mass function slope, total
mass, mass density and relaxation time. We derive ages in the range 140 -- 1
100 Myr, Galactocentric distances within 7.7 -- 11.4 kpc, and total masses
within 360--2 900 \ms. Reflecting large-scale mass segregation, the MF slope in
the core is significantly flatter than that in the halo of the five clusters.
Although some of the present clusters are relatively younger than the Gyr-old
clusters, they present evidence of advanced dynamical evolution. This kind of
study has become possible because of the photometric uniformity and spatial
coverage of 2MASS which allows a proper subtraction of the field-star
contamination on the target CMDs. The present study indicates that low-contrast
clusters can be studied with 2MASS, particularly after field-star subtraction,
which is important since most of the unstudied open clusters belong to this
class.",2005-08-08T13:18:52Z
Constraints on the Variation of G from Primordial Nucleosynthesis,"We study here the effect of a varying G on the evolution of the early
Universe and, in particular, on primordial nucleosynthesis. This variation of G
is modelled using the Brans-Dicke theory as well as a more general class of
scalar-tensor theories. Modified nucleosynthesis codes are used to investigate
this effect and the results obtained are used to constrain the parameters of
the theories. We extend previous studies of primordial nucleosynthesis in
scalar-tensor theories by including effects which can cause a slow variation of
G during radiation domination and by including a late-time accelerating phase
to the Universe's history. We include a brief discussion on the epoch of
matter-radiation equality in Brans-Dicke theory, which is also of interest for
determining the positions of the cosmic microwave background power-spectrum
peaks.",2005-04-19T17:15:14Z
VLTI observations of AGB stars,"We report on recent observations of AGB stars obtained with the VLT
Interferometer (VLTI). We illustrate in general the potential of
interferometric measurements to study stellar atmospheres and circumstellar
envelopes, and demonstrate in particular the advantages of a coordinated
multi-wavelength approach including near/mid-infrared as well as radio
interferometry. We report on studies of the atmospheric structure of non-Mira
and Mira variable giants. We have used VLTI observations of the near- and
mid-infrared stellar sizes and concurrent VLBA observations of the SiO maser
emission. So far, this project includes studies of the Mira stars S Ori and RR
Aql as well as of the supergiant AH Sco. The results from our first epochs of S
Ori measurements have recently been published and the main results are reviewed
here. The S Ori maser ring is found to lie at a mean distance of approximately
2 stellar radii, a result that is virtually free of the usual uncertainty
inherent in comparing observations of variable stars widely separated in time
and stellar phase. We discuss the status of our more recent S Ori, RR Aql, and
AH Sco observations, and present an outlook on the continuation of our project.",2005-05-12T11:33:50Z

Rapid Dissipation of Primordial Gas from the AU Microscopii Debris Disk,"The disk around AU Microscopii, an M1 star in the Beta Pictoris Moving Group,
is extraordinarily well-suited for comparison to the Beta Pic debris disk (type
A5V). We use far-UV absorption spectroscopy of AU Mic to probe its edge-on disk
for small amounts of molecular hydrogen, the primary constituent of gas giant
planets. Our conservative upper limit on the line-of-sight H_2 column density
is 1.7 x 10^{19} cm^{-2}, which is 18.5 times lower than the limit obtained
from non-detection of sub-mm CO emission (Liu et al. 2004). In addition, there
is a hint of H_2 absorption at a column density an order of magnitude or more
below our upper limit. The H_2-to-dust ratio in the AU Mic disk is < 6:1,
similar to that in the Beta Pic disk. This shows that the primordial gas has
largely been dissipated in less than about 12 Myr for both disks, despite their
very different stellar masses and luminosities. It is extremely difficult to
form a giant planet around AU Mic with current core-accretion scenarios in such
a short time.",2005-05-13T21:40:43Z
The Metallicity - Kinematics Relation in Large-N(HI) Absorbers,"Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar spectroscopy is yielding a database of
strong low-ionization MgII absorbers over the redshift interval 0.36<z<2.28
which is over two orders of magnitude larger than anything previously
assembled. HST UV spectroscopy has been used to measure neutral hydrogen column
densities for a small subset of them. These data empirically show that MgII
absorbers with rest equivalent widths $W^{\lambda2796}_0 \ge 0.6$ \AA have a
mean neutral hydrogen column density that is roughly constant at $N(HI) \approx
4 \times 10^{20}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$, with individual systems lying in the damped
Ly-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA regimes. Since the MgII doublets generally exhibit
saturation, the $W^{\lambda2796}_0$ values are an indication of the absorbers'
velocity spreads. Thus, we can study neutral-gas-phase metallicities as a
function of kinematics by forming SDSS composite spectra and measuring weak
unsaturated metal lines that form in neutral gas (e.g., CrII, FeII, MnII, SiII,
ZnII) as a function of $W^{\lambda2796}_0$. We use this method on SDSS
composite spectra to show how metallicity and kinematics are positively
correlated for large N(HI) absorbers, including trends related to dust
depletion and the enhancement of alpha-elements. We also discuss the need to
account for selection effects in DLA surveys, and we make inferences about
models for DLA absorption and their contribution to cosmic star formation.",2005-06-28T16:02:51Z
Similarity theory of stellar models and structure of very massive stars,"The similarity theory of stellar structure is used to study the properties of
very massive stars when one can neglect all the sources of opacity except for
the Thomson scattering. The dimensionless internal structure of such stars is
practically independent of the energy generation law.
  It is shown that the mass-luminosity relation can be approximated by an
analytical expression which is virtually universal regarding the chemical
composition and energy generation law. A detailed comparison with the
  Eddington standard model is given. The application of the obtained results to
the observations of massive stars is briefly discussed.",2005-05-03T13:29:41Z
"TRIDENT: an Infrared Differential Imaging Camera Optimized for the
  Detection of Methanated Substellar Companions","A near-infrared camera in use at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)
and at the 1.6-m telescope of the Observatoire du Mont-Megantic is described.
The camera is based on a Hawaii-1 1024x1024 HgCdTe array detector. Its main
feature is to acquire three simultaneous images at three wavelengths across the
methane absorption bandhead at 1.6 microns, enabling, in theory, an accurate
subtraction of the stellar point spread function (PSF) and the detection of
faint close methanated companions. The instrument has no coronagraph and
features fast data acquisition, yielding high observing efficiency on bright
stars. The performance of the instrument is described, and it is illustrated by
laboratory tests and CFHT observations of the nearby stars GL526, Ups And and
Chi And. TRIDENT can detect (6 sigma) a methanated companion with delta H = 9.5
at 0.5"" separation from the star in one hour of observing time. Non-common path
aberrations and amplitude modulation differences between the three optical
paths are likely to be the limiting factors preventing further PSF attenuation.
Instrument rotation and reference star subtraction improve the detection limit
by a factor of 2 and 4 respectively. A PSF noise attenuation model is presented
to estimate the non-common path wavefront difference effect on PSF subtraction
performance.",2005-04-28T23:50:18Z
"Molecular Gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA): IV. Gravitational Torques
  and AGN Feeding","We discuss the efficiency of stellar gravity torques as a mechanism to
account for the feeding of the central engines of four low luminosity AGN:
NGC4321, NGC4826, NGC4579 and NGC6951. These galaxies have been observed as
part of the NUGA CO project, aimed at the study of AGN fueling mechanisms. Our
calculations allow us to derive the characteristic time-scales for gas flows
and discuss whether torques from the stellar potentials are efficient enough to
drain the gas angular momentum in the inner 1 kpc of these galaxies. Results
indicate paradoxically that feeding should be thwarted close to the AGN: in the
four cases analyzed, gravity torques are mostly positive inside r~200pc,
resulting in no inflow on these scales. As a possible solution for the paradox,
we speculate that the agent responsible for driving inflow to still smaller
radii is transient and thus presently absent in the stellar potential.
Alternatively, the gravity torque barrier associated with the ILR of the bars
in these galaxies could be overcome by other mechanisms that become competitive
in due time against gravity torques. We find that viscosity can counteract
moderate--to--low gravity torques on the gas if it acts on a nuclear ring of
high gas surface density contrast and a few 100pc size. We propose an
evolutionary scenario in which gravity torques and viscosity act in concert to
produce recurrent episodes of activity during the typical lifetime of any
galaxy. In this scenario the recurrence of activity in galaxies is indirectly
related to that of the bar instabilities.",2005-07-04T16:27:26Z
Deep ACS Imaging of the Halo of NGC 5128: Reaching the Horizontal Branch,"Using the HST Wide Field Camera of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), we
have obtained deep (V,I) photometry of an outer-halo field in NGC 5128, to a
limiting magnitude of I~29. Our photometry directly reveals the core
helium-burning stellar population (the ``red clump'' or horizontal branch) in a
giant E/S0 galaxy for the first time.
  The color-magnitude diagram displays a very wide red giant branch (RGB), an
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) bump, and the red clump; no noticeable population
of blue HB stars is present, confirming previous suggestions that old, very
metal-poor population is not ubiquitous in the halo of this galaxy. From the
upper RGB we derive the metallicity distribution, which we find to be very
broad and moderately metal-rich, with average [M/H]=-0.64 and dispersion 0.49
dex. The MDF is virtually identical to that found in other halo fields observed
previously with the HST, but with an enhanced metal-rich population which was
partially missed in the previous surveys due to V-band incompleteness for these
very red stars. Combining the metallicity sensitive colors of the RGB stars
with the metallicity and age sensitive features of the AGB bump and the red
clump, we infer the average age of the halo stars to be 8^{+3}_{-3.5} Gy.
  As part of our study, we present an empirical calibration of the ACS F606W
and F814W filters to the standard V and I bands, achieved with ground-based
observations of the same field made from the EMMI camera of the New Technology
Telescope of the ESO La Silla Observatory.",2005-05-31T14:42:11Z
Duality extended Chaplygin cosmologies with a big rip,"We consider modifications to the Friedmann equation motivated by recent
proposals along these lines pursuing an explanation to the observed late time
acceleration. Here we show those modifications can be framed within a theory
with self-interacting gravity, where the term self-interaction refers here to
the presence of functions of $\rho$ and $p$ in the right hand side of the
Einstein equations. We then discuss the construction of the duals of the
cosmologies generated within that framework. After that we investigate the
modifications required to generate generalized and modified Chaplygin
cosmologies and show that their duals belong to a larger family of cosmologies
we call extended Chaplygin cosmologies. Finally, by letting the parameters of
those models take values not earlier considered in the literature we show some
representatives of that family of cosmologies display sudden future
singularities, which indicates their behavior is rather different from
generalized or modified Chaplygin gas cosmologies. This reinforces the idea
that modifications of gravity can be responsible for unexpected evolutionary
features in the universe.",2005-05-12T12:19:04Z
"Tentative Identification of Interstellar Dust in the Nose of the
  Heliosphere","Observations of the weak polarization of light from nearby stars, reported by
Tinbergen (1982), are consistent with polarization by small, radius <0.14
microm, interstellar dust grains entrained in the magnetic wall of the
heliosphere. The direction of maximum polarization is offset by ~35 deg from
the heliosphere nose, and extends to low ecliptic latitudes. An offset is found
between the direction of the best aligned dust grains, and the upwind direction
of the undeflected large interstellar grains seen by Ulysses and Galileo. In
the aligned-grain region, the strength of polarization anti-correlates with
ecliptic latitude, indicating that the magnetic wall is predominantly at
negative ecliptic latitudes, which is consistent with predictions of Linde
(1998). These data are consistent with an interstellar magnetic field tilt of
60 deg with respect to the ecliptic plane, and parallel to the galactic plane.
Interstellar dust grains captured in the heliosheath may also introduce a weak,
but important, large scale contaminant for the cosmic microwave background
signal with a symmetry consistent with the relative tilts of \Bis and the
ecliptic.",2005-06-13T22:30:30Z
Too Early? On the Apparent Conflict of Astrobiology and Cosmology,"An interesting consequence of the modern cosmological paradigm is the spatial
infinity of the universe. When coupled with naturalistic understanding of the
origin of life and intelligence, which follows the basic tenets of
astrobiology, and with some fairly incontroversial assumptions in the theory of
observation selection effects, this infinity leads, as Ken Olum has recently
shown, to a paradoxical conclusion. Olum's paradox is related, to the famous
Fermi's paradox in astrobiology and SETI studies. We, hereby, present an
evolutionary argument countering the apparent inconsistency, and show how, in
the framework of a simplified model, deeper picture of the coupling between
histories of intelligent/technological civilizations and astrophysical
evolution of the Galaxy, can be achieved. This strategy has consequences of
importance for both astrobiological studies and philosophy.",2005-04-30T14:33:18Z
Magnetars origin and progenitors with enhanced rotation,"Among a dozen known magnetar candidates there are no binary objects. As an
estimate of a fraction of binary neutron stars is about 10% it is reasonable to
address the question of solitarity of magnetars, to estimate theoretically the
fraction of binary objects among them, and to mark o probable companions. We
present population synthesis calculations of binary systems. Our goal is to
estimate the number of neutron stars originated from progenitors with enhanced
rotation, as such compact objects can be expected to have large magnetic
fields, ie. they can be magnetars. The fraction of such neutron stars in our
calculations is about 13-16%. Most of these objects are isolated due to
coalescences of components prior to a neutron star formation, or due to a
system disruption after a supernova explosion. The fraction of such neutron
stars in survived binaries is about 1% or lower. Their most numerous companions
are black holes.",2005-05-19T13:33:03Z
Low-energy quantum gravity leads to another picture of the universe,"If gravitons are super-strong interacting particles and the low-temperature
graviton background exists, the basic cosmological conjecture about the
Dopplerian nature of redshifts may be false: a full magnitude of cosmological
redshift would be caused by interactions of photons with gravitons.
Non-forehead collisions with gravitons will lead to a very specific additional
relaxation of any photonic flux that gives a possibility of another
interpretation of supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics. These facts may
implicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm. Some
features of a new paradigm are discussed. In a frame of this model, every
observer has two different cosmological horizons. One of them is defined by
maximum existing temperatures of remote sources - by big enough distances, all
of them will be masked with the CMB radiation. Another, and much smaller, one
depends on their maximum luminosity - the luminosity distance increases with a
redshift much quickly than the geometrical one.
  If the considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the
nature, then an existence of black holes contradicts to the equivalence
principle. In this approach, the two fundamental constants - Hubble's and
Newton's ones - should be connected between themselves. The theoretical value
of the Hubble constant is computed. Also, every massive body would be
decelerated due to collisions with gravitons that may be connected with the
Pioneer 10 anomaly.",2005-05-14T19:34:27Z
"Measurement of Pressure Dependent Fluorescence Yield of Air: Calibration
  Factor for UHECR Detectors","In a test experiment at the Final Focus Test Beam of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, the fluorescence yield of 28.5 GeV electrons in air and
nitrogen was measured. The measured photon yields between 300 and 400 nm at 1
atm and 29 deg C are Y(760 Torr, air) = 4.42 +/- 0.73 and Y(760 Torr, nitrogen)
= 29.2 +/- 4.8 photons per electron per meter. Assuming that the fluorescence
yield is proportional to the energy deposition of a charged particle traveling
through air, good agreement with measurements at lower particle energies is
observed.",2005-06-29T21:14:01Z

The Excess Far-Infrared Emission of AGN in the Local Universe,"We have cross-correlated the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) second data
release spectroscopic galaxy sample with the IRAS faint-source catalogue (FSC).
Optical emission line ratios are used to classify the galaxies with reliable
IRAS 60 and 100 microns detections into AGN and normal star-forming galaxies.
We then create subsamples of normal galaxies and AGN that are very closely
matched in terms of key physical properties such as stellar mass, redshift,
size, concentration and mean stellar age (as measured by absorption line
indicators in the SDSS spectra). We then quantify whether there are systematic
differences between the IR luminosities of the galaxies and the AGN in the
matched subsamples. We find that the AGN exhibit a significant excess in far-IR
emission relative to the star-forming galaxies in our sample. The excesses at
60 and 100 microns are 0.21 +/- 0.03 dex and 0.12 +/- 0.035 dex in
log[L(60)/M*] and log[L(100)/M*], respectively. We then discuss whether the
far-IR excess is produced by radiation from the active nucleus that is absorbed
by dust or alternatively, by an extra population of young stars that is not
detectable at optical wavelengths.",2005-06-16T14:42:00Z
"Simultaneous Ultraviolet and X-ray Observations of the Seyfert Galaxy
  NGC 4151. I. Physical Conditions in the X-ray Absorbers","We present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic X-ray absorption in the
Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151 using Chandra/HETGS data obtained 2002 May, as part
of a program which included simultaneous UV spectra using HST/STIS and FUSE.
NGC 4151 was in a relatively low flux state during the observations reported
here, although roughly 2.5 times as bright in the 2 --10 keV band as during a
Chandra observation in 2000. The soft X-ray band was dominated by emission
lines, which show no discernible variation in flux between the two
observations. The 2002 data show the presence of a very highly ionized
absorber, in the form of H-like and He-like Mg, Si, and S lines, as well as
lower ionization gas via the presence of inner-shell absorption lines from
lower-ionization species of these elements. The former is too highly ionized to
be radiatively accelerated in a sub-Eddington source such as NGC 4151. We find
that the lower ionization gas had a column density a factor of ~ 3 higher
during the 2000 observation. If due to bulk motion, we estimate that this
component must have a velocity of more than 1250 km/sec transverse to our
line-of-sight. We suggest that these results are consistent with a
magneto-hydrodynamic flow.",2005-07-14T17:22:56Z
"Extragalactic Globular Clusters in the Near-Infrared: V. IC 4051 and NGC
  3311","We present the results of combined optical and near-infrared photometry for
the globular cluster systems of the giant ellipticals IC 4051 and NGC 3311. We
use the reduced age-metallicity degeneracy in (V-I) vs.(V-H) color-color
diagrams to derive the cumulative age distribution within the red
sub-population of globular clusters and to search for age sub-populations. The
age distribution is then compared to the one determined for simulated globular
cluster systems in order to set constraints on the relative age and size of
these globular cluster sub-populations. In both galaxies we find a significant
fraction of globular clusters with ages between 2- 5 Gyr. We also investigate
the metallicity distribution in both systems. Small number statistics prevent
us from making any definite statements concerning NGC 3311, but we find that
the derived metallicity distribution of the IC 4051 clusters strongly depends
on the assumed age distribution. Based on our most likely result that finds a
large number of young/intermediate age clusters (~2 Gyr) within the selected
globular cluster sample, we find metallicity peaks at $\sim$ -0.2 for the old
clusters and +0.8 for the young clusters. Only few very metal poor clusters are
found. However, the metallicity distribution within the young/intermediate
globular cluster population is significantly affected by our choice of the
applied Single Stellar Population model. The mean metallicity of the second
generation of globular clusters changes from the above mentioned and extremely
high +0.8 dex to +0.2 dex. Note that the model dependency becomes less severe
with an increasing age of the cluster population.",2005-05-05T18:12:54Z
Evidence for a co-moving sub-stellar companion of GQ Lup,"We present a companion of the \le 2 Myr young classical T Tauri star GQ Lup
in the Lupus star forming region at 140 \pm 50 pc from imaging, astrometry, and
spectroscopy. With direct K-band imaging using VLT/NACO, we detected an object
6 mag fainter than GQ Lup located 0.7 arc sec west of it. Compared to images
obtained 2 to 5 years earlier with Subaru/CIAO and HST/PC, this object shares
the proper motion of GQ Lup by 5 and 7 sigma, respectively, hence it is a
co-moving companion. Its K-L' color is consistent with a spectral type early to
mid L. Our NACO K-band spectrum yields spectral type M9-L4 with H2O and CO
absorption, consistent with the new GAIA-Dusty template spectrum for log g = 2
to 3 and Teff = 2000 K with ~2 Rjup radius at ~140 pc, hence few Jupiter
masses. Using the theoretical models from Wuchterl & Tscharnuter (2003),
Burrows et al. (1997), and Baraffe et al. (2002), the mass lies between 1 and
42 Jupiter masses.",2005-03-31T11:33:27Z
Integral Field Spectroscopy of 23 Spiral Bulges,"We have obtained Integral Field Spectroscopy for 23 spiral bulges using
INTEGRAL on the William Herschel Telescope and SPIRAL on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope. This is the first 2D survey directed solely at the bulges of spiral
galaxies. Eleven galaxies of the sample do not have previous measurements of
the stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*). These data are designed to complement
our Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph program for estimating black hole
masses in the range 10^6-10^8M_sun using gas kinematics from nucleated disks.
These observations will serve to derive the stellar dynamical bulge properties
using the traditional Mgb and CaII triplets. We use both Cross Correlation and
Maximum Penalized Likelihood to determine projected sigma* in these systems and
present radial velocity fields, major axis rotation curves, curves of growth
and sigma* fields. Using the Cross Correlation to extract the low order 2D
stellar dynamics we generally see coherent radial rotation and irregular
velocity dispersion fields suggesting that sigma* is a non-trivial parameter to
estimate.",2005-04-29T12:57:55Z
UHECR Composition Measurements Using the HiRes-II Detector,"While stereo measurements of extensive air showers allow a more precise
determination of the depth of shower maximum and hence the composition of
UHECR's, monocular measurements allow one to go much lower in energy. Since the
composition of UHECR seems to constant throughout the HiRes stereo energy range
but changing just below it, this is not a trivial lowering of the energy
threshold. We fit the observed Xmax distribution to a combination of expected
proton and iron Xmax distributions, using two different interaction models, to
determine the relative fraction of light and heavy components throughout the
HiRes monocular energy range. Using a two component fit allows both the mean
Xmax and the width of the Xmax distribution to contribute composition
measurement and allows us to deal with the Xmax acceptance bias caused by
limited elevation coverage. An updated analysis from a larger data set will be
presented in Pune.",2005-07-20T17:34:37Z
Blue Luminescence and the Presence of Small PAHs in the ISM,"Blue Luminescence (BL) was first discovered in a proto-planetary nebula, the
Red Rectangle (RR) surrounding the post-AGB star HD 44179. BL has been
attributed to fluorescence by small, 3-4 ringed neutral polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules, and was thought to be unique to the RR environment
where such small molecules are actively being produced and shielded from the
harsh interstellar radiation by a dense circumstellar disk. In this paper we
present the BL spectrum detected in several ordinary reflection nebulae
illuminated by stars having temperatures between 10,000 -- 23,000 K. All these
nebulae are known to also exhibit the infrared emission features called
aromatic emission features (AEFs) attributed to large PAHs. We present the
spatial distribution of the BL in these nebulae. In the case of Ced~112, the BL
is spatially correlated with mid-IR emission structures attributed to AEFs.
These observations provide evidence for grain processing and possibly for
in-situ formation of small grains and large molecules from larger aggregates.
Most importantly, the detection of BL in these ordinary reflection nebulae
suggests that the BL carrier is an ubiquitous component of the ISM and is not
restricted to the particular environment of the RR.",2005-07-13T16:18:11Z
"A Log-Quadratic Relation Between the Nuclear Black-Hole Masses and
  Velocity Dispersions of Galaxies","We demonstrate that a log-linear relation does not provide an adequate
description of the correlation between the masses of Super-Massive Black-Holes
(SMBH, M_bh) and the velocity dispersions of their host spheroid (sigma). An
unknown relation between log(M_bh) and log(sigma) may be expanded to second
order to obtain a log-quadratic relation of the form log(M_bh)=alpha+beta
log(sigma/200) + beta_2[log(sigma/200)]^2. We perform a Bayesian analysis using
the Nuker sample, and solve for beta, beta_2 and alpha, in addition to the
intrinsic scatter (delta). We find unbiased parameter estimates of
beta=4.2+/-0.37, beta_2=1.6+/-1.3 and delta=0.275+/-0.05. At the 80% level the
M_bh-sigma relation does not follow a uniform power-law. Indeed, over the
velocity range 70km/s<sigma<380km/s the logarithmic slope of the best fit
relation varies between 2.7 and 5.1, which should be compared with a power-law
estimate of 4.02+/-0.33. Assuming no systematic offset, single epoch virial
SMBH masses estimated for AGN follow the same log-quadratic M_bh-sigma relation
as the Nuker sample, but extend it downward in mass by an order of magnitude.
The log-quadratic term in the M_bh-sigma relation has a significant effect on
estimates of the local SMBH mass function at M_bh>10^9 solar masses, leading to
densities of SMBHs with M_bh>10^10 solar masses that are several orders of
magnitude larger than inferred from a log-linear relation. We also estimate
unbiased parameters for the SMBH-bulge mass relation. With a parameterisation
log(M_bh)=alpha_b + beta_b log(M_b/10^{11}) + beta_2b[log(M_b/10^{11})]^2, we
find beta_b=1.15+/-0.18 and beta_2b=0.12+/-0.14. We determined an intrinsic
scatter delta_b=0.41+/-0.07 which is ~50% larger than the scatter in the
M_bh-sigma relation.",2005-03-21T03:00:47Z
The Aao/Ukst Supercosmos H-alpha Survey (SHS),"The UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) of the Anglo-Australian Observatory completed
a narrow-band H-alpha plus [NII] 6548, 6584A survey of the Southern Galactic
Plane and Magellanic Clouds in late 2003. The survey, which was the last UKST
wide-field photographic survey, and the only one undertaken in a narrow band,
is now an on-line digital data product of the Wide-Field Astronomy Unit of the
Royal Observatory Edinburgh (ROE). The survey utilised a high specification,
monolithic H-alpha interference band-pass filter of exceptional quality. In
conjunction with the fine grained Tech-Pan film as a detector it has produced a
survey with a powerful combination of area coverage (4000 square degrees),
resolution (~1 arcsecond) and sensitivity (<=5 Rayleighs), reaching a depth for
continuum point sources of R~20.5. The main survey consists of 233 individual
fields on a grid of centres separated by 4 degrees at declinations below +2
degrees and covers a swathe approximately 20 degrees wide about the Southern
Galactic Plane. The original survey films were scanned by the SuperCOSMOS
measuring machine at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh to provide the on-line
digital atlas called the SuperCOSMOS H-alpha Survey (SHS). We present the
background to the survey, the key survey characteristics, details and examples
of the data product, calibration process, comparison with other surveys and a
brief description of its potential for scientific exploitation.",2005-06-24T15:06:27Z
"Deriving star formation histories from integrated light: Colors and
  indices","We present results of a detailed study aiming at understanding to what
precision star formation histories (SFHs) can be determined for distant
galaxies observable in integrated light only. Using our evolutionary synthesis
code, we have performed a set of simulations of galaxies with a wide range of
different SFHs. By analysing the resulting colors, spectra and Lick indices, we
investigate to which extent different SF scenarios can be discriminated on the
basis of their photometric and spectral properties, respectively. We find the
robust result that no later than 4 Gyrs after the latest episode of enhanced
star formation all scenarios exhibit very similar colors and indices; in
practice, it is not possible to distinguish different scenarios of star
formation which have evolved for more than 1, at the utmost 3-4 Gyrs since the
last star forming event, even when using spectral indices. For how long
different SF scenarios can be disentangled highly depends on the range of
colors available and absorption lines considered, as well as on the details of
the SFHs to be compared.",2005-07-12T21:29:53Z
"X-ray Spectral Evolution of Her X-1 in a Low State and the Following
  Short High State","We analyzed spectral variations of $\sim 8.5$ days long RXTE monitoring
observations of Her X-1 in December 2001. This set of observations enables, for
the first time, frequent continuous monitoring (111 pointings in $\sim 8.5$
days) of the source with RXTE including $\sim 1.7$ days long low state part and
the following $\sim 6.8$ days long short high state part. We used absorbed
power law model with iron line energy complex modeled as a Gaussian to fit both
the 3-60 keV PCA-HEXTE overall short high state spectrum and 3-20 keV
individual PCA spectra. Additional partial cold absorber model was used for
both cases. Using 3-20 keV individual PCA spectra, absorption in anomalous dips
and preeclipse dips in short high state were compared. Decreasing ratio of
unabsorbed flux to absorbed flux with increasing unabsorbed flux in anomalous
and preeclipse dips was interpreted as an evidence of the fact that the regions
causing opaque obscuration and soft absorption are not geometrically far away
from each other. Higher iron line peak energies in low state and short high
state ($\sim 6.6-6.9$ keV) were interpreted as a clue of the presence of iron
line components other than K$\alpha$ emission line.",2005-06-10T06:13:04Z

  Observations","We present an empirical method for converting single-point near-infrared J,
H, and K measurements of fundamental-mode Cepheids to mean magnitudes, using
complete light curves in V or I bands. The algorithm is based on the template
light curves in the near-infrared bandpasses. The mean uncertainty of the
method is estimated to about 0.03 mag, which is smaller than the uncertainties
obtained in other approaches to the problem in the literature.",2005-03-29T16:29:44Z
Orientation and size of the `Z' in `X'-shaped radio galaxies,"Some X-shaped radio galaxies show a Z-symmetric morphology in the less
luminous secondary lobes. Within the scenario of a merger between two galaxies,
each hosting a supermassive black hole in its center, this structure has been
explained before: As the smaller galaxy spirals towards the common center, it
releases gas to the ISM of the larger active galaxy. The ram pressure of this
streaming gas will bend the lobes of the pre-merger jet into a Z-shape. After
the black holes have merged the jet propagates in a new direction that is
aligned with the angular momentum of the binary black hole. In this article we
deproject the pre- and post-merger jets. Taking into account the expected
angles between the jet pairs and with the assumption that their directions are
uncorrelated, we show that one of three possible orientations of the jets with
respect to the line of sight is more likely than the others. This actually
depends on the distance where the bending occurs. Another result of our
deprojection is that the streaming gas bends the jet into a Z-shape in a range
between about 30 and 100 kpc distance to the center of the primary galaxy. We
confirm this finding by comparing our predictions for the properties of the
rotational velocity field and its radius with observations and numerical
simulations of merging galaxies. Thus our results support the merger scenario
as explanation for X- and Z-shaped radio galaxies with the jet pointing along
the former axis of orbital angular momentum of the binary.",2005-07-06T11:34:06Z
"The INT/WFC survey of the Monoceros Ring: Accretion origin or Galactic
  Anomaly?","We present the results of a wide-field camera survey of the stars in the
Monoceros Ring, thought to be an additional structure in the Milky Way of
unknown origin. Lying roughly in the plane of the Milky Way, this may represent
a unique equatorial accretion event which is contributing to the Thick Disk of
the Galaxy. Alternatively, the Monoceros Ring may be a natural part of the Disk
formation process. With ten pointings in symmetric pairs above and below the
plane of the Galaxy, this survey spans 90 degrees about the Milky Way's
equator. Signatures of the stream of stars were detected in three fields, ({\it
l},{\it b}) = (118,+16)$^\circ$ and (150,+15)$^\circ$ plus a more tentative
detection at (150,-15)$^\circ$. Galactocentric distance estimates to these
structures gave $\sim$17, $\sim$17, and $\sim$13 kpc respectively. The
Monoceros Ring seems to be present on both sides of the Galactic plane, in a
form different to that of the Galactic suggestive of a tidal origin with
streams multiply wrapping the Galaxy. A new model of the stream has shown a
strong coincidence with our results and has also provided the opportunity to
make several more detections in fields in which the stream is less significant.
The confirmed detection at ({\it l},{\it b}) = (123,-19)$^\circ$ at $\sim$14,
kpc from the Galactic centre allows a re-examination revealing a tentative new
detection with a Galactocentric distance of $\sim$21 kpc. (Abridged)",2005-06-22T03:06:52Z
Low-Mass Runaway Stars from the Orion Trapezium Cluster,"In the course of a search for common proper motion binaries, in the Jones &
Walker (JW) catalogue of proper motions in the Orion Nebula Cluster, we came
across several faint stars with proper motions larger than one arcsecond per
century and probabilities of membership P larger than 0.90. Such stars are
interesting because they could be low-mass runaway stars recently accelerated
by n-body interactions in compact multiple systems. Of particular interest
among these stars is JW 451, which has a P = 0.98, the largest transverse
velocity among all the stars with P larger or equal than 0.5 (69 km/s), and a
proper motion vector which suggests that it was accelerated by the component C
of the Trapezium some 1000 years ago. A closer examination of those JW stars
with proper motion larger than one arcsec per century revealed that two other
stars, JW 349 and JW 355 (with transverse velocities of 38 and 90 km/s
respectively), in spite of being listed with P = 0 by JW, should also be
considered part of the cluster, because these objects are also externally
ionized proplyds. In fact, Hillenbrand (1997) assigns to them probabilities of
membership of 0.99. Moreover, the proper motion errors of these two stars are
relatively small, and so they are good candidates to be runaway stars recently
accelerated in the Orion Nebula Cluster.",2005-05-31T22:17:03Z
A Spitzer/IRAC Survey of Massive Star-Forming Regions,"We are conducting a survey of several regions of high-mass star formation to
assess their content and structure. The observations include Spitzer
observations, ground-based optical and near-IR imaging surveys, and optical and
IR spectra of objects and locations in the molecular clouds. The goal of the
survey is to gain a better understanding of the processes involved in high mass
star formation by determining the characteristics of the stars detected in
these regions and investigating the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM)
environment in which these stars form. In this contribution, we present results
on the identification and spatial analysis of young stars in three clusters,
W5/AFGL 4029, S255, and S235. First we show how the IRAC data are used to
roughly segregate young stars according to their mid-infrared colors, into two
groups corresponding the SED Class I and Class II young stellar objects. Then
using the IRAC data in combination with 2MASS, we show how more young stars can
be identified. Finally, we examine the spatial distributions of young stars in
these clusters and find a range of morphologies and of peak surface densities.",2005-07-29T14:54:13Z
Simulations of Stellar Collisions Involving Pre-Main Sequence Stars,"In this paper, we present the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH)
simulations of collisions between pre-main sequence stars and a variety of
other kinds of stars. Simulations over a range of impact parameters and
velocities were performed. We find that pre-main sequence stars tend to ``wrap
themselves'' around their impactor. We discuss the probable evolutionary state
of products of collisions between pre-main sequence stars and pre-main
sequence, main sequence, giant branch, and compact stars. The nature of the
collision product does not depend strongly on the impact parameter or the
velocity of the collision.",2005-03-21T18:43:51Z
The counterparts of Local Group dwarf spheroidals in nearby clusters,"In this contribution, we report on the discovery of dwarf spheroidals (dSphs)
in the core of the Fornax cluster. Their photometric properties -- like
magnitude, colour, surface brightness -- are very similar to those of Local
Group dSphs. However, at a given total magnitude, dSphs in Fornax seem to be
more extended than their Local Group counterparts. The membership of several
dwarf galaxy candidates in Fornax has been confirmed by surface brightness
fluctuation measurements on deep wide-field images taken with the Magellan
telescope. The analysis of these images also confirms the flat faint end slope
of the luminosity function for dSphs in Fornax which contradicts the expected
large number of small dark matter halos connected to dwarf galaxies in
LambdaCDM theory. Dwarf spheroidals have also been detected in the Hydra I and
Centaurus cluster. A preliminary analysis of their photometric properties shows
that they obey similar scaling relations as their counterparts in Fornax and
the Local Group.",2005-05-10T12:07:02Z
A Morphological Study of Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxies,"We present a comprehensive study of the morphological properties of 42
gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope in
the optical band. The purpose of this study is to understand the relation of
GRBs to their macro-environments, and to compare the GRB-selected galaxies to
other high redshift samples. We perform both qualitative and quantitative
analyses by categorizing the galaxies according to their visual properties, and
by examining their surface brightness profiles. We find that all of the
galaxies have approximately exponential profiles, indicative of galactic disks,
and have a median scale length of about 1.7 kpc. Inspection of the visual
morphologies reveals a high fraction of merging and interacting systems, with
\~30% showing clear signs of interaction, and an additional ~30% exhibiting
irregular and asymmetric structure which may be the result of recent mergers;
these fractions are independent of redshift and galaxy luminosity. On the other
hand, the three GRB host galaxies for which submillimeter and radio emission
has been detected are isolated and compact, unlike the luminous
submillimeter-selected galaxies. The fraction of mergers appears to be elevated
compared to other high redshift samples, particularly for the low luminosities
of GRB hosts (M_B ~ -16 to -21 mag). This suggests that merging and interacting
galaxies undergoing a burst of star formation may be an efficient site for the
production of GRB progenitors. Finally, we show that GRB hosts clearly follow
the size-luminosity relation present in other galaxy samples, but thanks to
absorption redshifts they help extend this relation to lower luminosities.",2005-08-02T01:24:35Z
"The size evolution of galaxies since z~3: combining SDSS, GEMS and FIRES","We present the evolution of the luminosity-size and stellar mass-size
relations of luminous (L_V>3.4x10^10h_70^-2L_sun) and of massive
(M_*>3x10^10h_70^-2M_sun) galaxies in the last ~11 Gyr. We use very deep
near-infrared images of the Hubble Deep Field-South and the MS1054-03 field in
the J_s, H and K_s bands from FIRES to retrieve the sizes in the optical
rest-frame for galaxies with z>1. We combine our results with those from GEMS
at 0.2<z<1 and SDSS at z~0.1 to achieve a comprehensive picture of the optical
rest-frame size evolution from z=0 to z=3. Galaxies are differentiated
according to their light concentration using the Sersic index n. For less
concentrated objects, the galaxies at a given luminosity were typically ~3+-0.5
(+-2 sigma) times smaller at z~2.5 than those we see today. The stellar
mass-size relation has evolved less: the mean size at a given stellar mass was
\~2+-0.5 times smaller at z~2.5, evolving proportional to (1+z)^{-0.40+-0.06}.
Simple scaling relations between dark matter halos and baryons in a
hierarchical cosmogony predict a stronger (although consistent within the error
bars) than observed evolution of the stellar mass-size relation. The observed
luminosity-size evolution out to z~2.5 matches well recent infall model
predictions for Milky-Way type objects. For low-n galaxies, the evolution of
the stellar mass-size relation would follow naturally if the individual
galaxies grow inside-out. For highly concentrated objects, the situation is as
follows: at a given luminosity, these galaxies were ~2.7+-1.1 times smaller at
z~2.5 (or put differently, were typically ~2.2+-0.7 mag brighter at a given
size than they are today), and at a given stellar mass the size has evolved
proportional to (1+z)^{-0.45+-0.10}.",2005-04-09T15:35:51Z
Low Order Aberrations in Band-Limited Lyot Coronagraphs,"We study the way Lyot coronagraphs with unapodized entrance pupils respond to
small, low order phase aberrations. This study is applicable to ground-based
adaptive optics coronagraphs operating at 90% and higher Strehl ratios, as well
as to some space-based coronagraphs with intrinsically higher Strehl ratio
imaging. We utilize a second order expansion of the monochromatic point-spread
function (written as a power spectrum of a power series in the phase aberration
over clear aperture) to derive analytical expressions for the response of a
`band-limited' Lyot coronagraph (BLC) to small, low order, phase aberrations.
The BLC possesses a focal plane mask with an occulting spot whose opacity
profile is a spatially band-limited function rather than a hard-edged, opaque
disk. The BLC is, to first order, insensitive to tilt and astigmatism.
Undersizing the stop in the re-imaged pupil plane (the Lyot plane) following
the focal plane mask can alleviate second order effects of astigmatism, at the
expense of system throughput and angular resolution. The optimal degree of such
undersizing depends on individual instrument designs and goals. Our analytical
work engenders physical insight, and complements existing numerical work on
this subject. Our methods can be extended to treat the passage of higher order
aberrations through band-limited Lyot coronagraphs, by using our polynomial
decomposition or an analogous Fourier approach.",2005-07-22T14:39:18Z
First Results from the CHARA Array. II. A Description of the Instrument,"The CHARA Array is a six 1-m telescope optical/IR interferometric array
located on Mount Wilson California, designed and built by the Center for High
Angular Resolution Astronomy of Georgia State University. In this paper we
describe the main elements of the Array hardware and software control systems
as well as the data reduction methods currently being used. Our plans for
upgrades in the near future are also described.",2005-04-04T21:01:36Z
AGN Outflows in a Cosmological Context,"We combine cosmological simulations with an AGN luminosity function
constrained by optical surveys in order to create a realistic AGN distribution
in which to model AGN outflows. The outflows are modeled with assumptions of
spherical symmetry and energy conservation. We study the importance of the
kinetic luminosity of AGN outflows in determining the fractional volume of the
IGM filled with outflows as a function of redshift. We find that kinetic
luminosities of < 10% of the bolometric luminosities are required or the entire
IGM would be filled with outflows at z=0. We also examine the effects of
varying the AGN lifetime and the bias parameter, which describes how tightly
correlated AGN are to high density regions. We find that longer lifetimes
(tau_{AGN} ~ 1 Gyr), as well as small bias parameters increase the filling
fraction.",2005-06-27T20:39:11Z
PHOENIX model chromospheres of mid- to late-type M dwarfs,"We present semi-empirical model chromospheres computed with the atmosphere
code PHOENIX. The models are designed to fit the observed spectra of five mid-
to late-type M dwarfs. Next to hydrogen lines from the Balmer series we used
various metal lines, e. g. from Fe {\sc i}, for the comparison between data and
models. Our computations show that an NLTE treatment of C, N, O impacts on the
hydrogen line formation, while NLTE treatment of less abundant metals such as
nickel influences the lines of the considered species itself. For our coolest
models we investigated also the influence of dust on the chromospheres and
found that dust increases the emission line flux.
  Moreover we present an (electronically published) emission line list for the
spectral range of 3100 to 3900 and 4700 to 6800 \AA for a set of 21 M dwarfs
and brown dwarfs. The line list includes the detection of the Na {\sc i} D
lines in emission for a L3 dwarf.",2005-05-18T14:35:57Z
"The Evolutionary Status of Be Stars: Results from a Photometric Study of
  Southern Open Clusters","Be stars are a class of rapidly rotating B stars with circumstellar disks
that cause Balmer and other line emission. There are three possible reasons for
the rapid rotation of Be stars: they may have been born as rapid rotators, spun
up by binary mass transfer, or spun up during the main-sequence (MS) evolution
of B stars. To test the various formation scenarios, we have conducted a
photometric survey of 55 open clusters in the southern sky. Of these, five
clusters are probably not physically associated groups and our results for two
other clusters are not reliable, but we identify 52 definite Be stars and an
additional 129 Be candidates in the remaining clusters. We use our results to
examine the age and evolutionary dependence of the Be phenomenon. We find an
overall increase in the fraction of Be stars with age until 100 Myr, and Be
stars are most common among the brightest, most massive B-type stars above the
zero-age MS (ZAMS). We show that a spin-up phase at the terminal-age MS (TAMS)
cannot produce the observed distribution of Be stars, but up to 73% of the Be
stars detected may have been spun-up by binary mass transfer. Most of the
remaining Be stars were likely rapid rotators at birth.
  Previous studies have suggested that low metallicity and high cluster density
may also favor Be star formation. Our results indicate a possible increase in
the fraction of Be stars with increasing cluster distance from the Galactic
center (in environments of decreasing metallicity). However, the trend is not
significant and could be ruled out due to the intrinsic scatter in our data. We
also find no relationship between the fraction of Be stars and cluster density.",2005-05-02T18:52:53Z
Slow-roll Inflation for Generalized Two-Field Lagrangians,"We study the slow-roll regime of two field inflation, in which the two fields
are also coupled through their kinetic terms. Such Lagrangians are motivated by
particle physics and by scalar-tensor theories studied in the Einstein frame.
We compute the power spectra of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations on
large scales to first order in the slow-roll parameters. We discuss the
relevance of the extra coupling terms for the amplitude and indexes of the
power spectra. Beyond the consistency condition which involves the amplitude of
gravitational waves, additional relations may be found in particular models
based on such Lagrangians: as an example, we find an additional general
consistency condition in implicit form for Brans-Dicke theory in the Einstein
frame.",2005-05-10T16:00:35Z
"Are Passive Spiral Galaxies truly 'passive' and 'spiral'?: a
  Near-Infrared perspective","Passive spiral galaxies - unusual galaxies with spiral morphologies but
without any sign of on-going star formation - have recently been shown to exist
preferentially in cluster infalling regions. This discovery directly connects
passive spiral galaxies to cluster galaxy evolution studies, such as the
Butcher-Oemler effect or the morphology-density relation. Thus, detailed study
of passive spiral galaxies could potentially yield new insight on the
underlying physical mechanisms governing cluster galaxy evolution.
  However, in previous work, passive spiral galaxies were selected from
low-resolution optical images with $\sim$1.5 arcsec seeing. Passive spirals
could therefore be mis-identified as S0 galaxies, or as dusty-starburst
galaxies which are not passive at all. To address this issue we performed deep,
high-resolution, near-infrared imaging of 32 passive spiral galaxies with
UKIRT.",2005-07-05T08:42:04Z
"Star Formation Histories of Nearby Elliptical Galaxies: I. Volume
  Limited Sample","This work presents high $S/N$ spectroscopic observations of a representative
sample of nearby elliptical galaxies. These observations provide a strong test
of models for the formation of elliptical galaxies and their star formation
histories. Combining these data with the Gonzalez (1993) data set, a volume
limited sample of 45 galaxies has been defined. Results are in agreement with
previous studies: the existence of the metallicity hyper-plane and the Z-plane
of Trager et al. (2000) is confirmed, and the distribution is clearly due to
physical variations in stellar population parameters and not measurement
uncertainty. Trends between stellar population parameters and galaxy structural
parameters suggest that angular momentum may determine the chemical abundance
of a galaxy at a given mass.",2005-06-17T20:14:54Z
"An Asymmetric, Energetic Type Ic Supernova Viewed Off-Axis, and a Link
  to Gamma-Ray Bursts","Type Ic supernovae, the explosions following the core collapse of massive
stars that have previously lost their hydrogen and helium envelopes, are
particularly interesting because of the link with long-duration gamma-ray
bursts. Although indications exist that these explosions are aspherical, direct
evidence has still been missing. Late-time observations of SN 2003jd, a
luminous Type Ic supernova, provide such evidence. Recent Subaru and Keck
spectra reveal double-peaked profiles in the nebular lines of neutral oxygen
and magnesium. These profiles are different from those of known Type Ic
supernovae, with or without a gamma-ray burst, and they can be understood if SN
2003jd was an aspherical, axisymmetric explosion viewed from near the
equatorial plane. If SN 2003jd was associated with a gamma-ray burst, we missed
the burst as it was pointing away from us.",2005-05-10T17:54:08Z
Pulsar shadow as the origin of double notches in radio pulse profiles,"We present the model of eclipsing a rotating, spatially extended source of
directional emission by a central absorber, and apply it to the pulsar
magnetosphere. The model assumes the radially extended inward radio emission
along the local direction of the magnetic field, and the pulsar as the
absorber. The geometry of the magnetic field lines of the rotating dipole is
favourable for the double eclipse events, which we identify with the double
notches observed in pulse profiles of nearby pulsars. For pulsars with large
dipole inclinations 70 <~ alpha <~ 110 deg the double notches are predicted to
occur within a narrow phase range of 20 to 30 deg before the main radio peak.
Application of the model to PSR B0950+08 establishes it as a nearly orthogonal
rotator (alpha =~ 75 deg, beta =~ -10 deg) with many pulse components naturally
interpreted in terms of the inward radio emission from a large range of
altitudes. The inward components include the intermittently strong, leading
component of the main pulse, which would traditionally have been interpeted as
a conal emission in the outward direction. The model also identifies the
magnetic field lines along which the radially extended inward radio emission
occurs in B0950+08. These have a narrow range of the footprint parameter s
close to 1.1 (closed field line region, near the last open field lines). We
describe directional characteristics of inward emission from the radially
extended region and compare them with characteristics of extended outward
emission. Our work shows that pulse profiles of at least some pulsars may be a
superposition of both inward and outward emission.",2005-03-18T12:22:31Z
"Highly Clumpy Structure of the Thermal Composite Supernova Remnant 3C391
  Unveiled by Chandra","The nature of the internal thermal X-ray emission seen in ``thermal
composite"" supernova remnants is still uncertain. Chandra observation of the
3C391 shows a southeast-northwest elongated morphology and unveils a highly
clumpy structure of the remnant. Detailed spatially resolved spectral analysis
for the small-scale features reveals normal metal abundance and uniform
temperature for the interior gas. The properties of the hot gas comparatively
favor the cloudlet evaporation model as a main mechanism for the ``thermal
composite"" X-ray appearance, though radiative rim and thermal conduction may
also be effective. A faint protrusion is found in Si and S lines out of the
southwest radio border.",2005-05-02T15:34:25Z
"Constraining fundamental stellar parameters using seismology.
  Application to Alpha Centauri AB","We apply the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm to seismic and
classical observables of the Alpha Cen binary system in order to derive the
fundamental parameters of Alpha Cen A+B and to analyze the dependence of these
parameters on the chosen observables, on their uncertainty and on the physics
used in stellar modelling. The seismological data are those by Bouchy & Carrier
(2002) for Alpha Cen A, and those by Carrier & Bourban (2003) for Alpha Cen B.
We show that while the fundamental stellar parameters do not depend on the
treatment of convection adopted (Mixing Length Theory -- MLT -- or ``Full
Spectrum of Turbulence'' -- FST), the age of the system depends on the
inclusion of gravitational settling, and is deeply biased by the small
frequency separation of component B.
  We try to answer the question of the universality of the mixing length
parameter, and we find a statistically reliable dependence of the
alpha--parameter on the HR diagram location (with a trend similar to the one
predicted by Ludwig et al.1999).
  We propose the frequency separation ratios introduced by Roxburgh &
Voronstsov (2003) as better observables to determine the fundamental stellar
parameters, and to use the large frequency separation and frequencies to
extract information about the stellar structure. The effects of diffusion and
equation of state on the oscillation frequencies are also studied, but present
seismic data do not allow their detection.",2005-05-26T14:04:41Z
"Detecting Dark Matter Annihilation with CMB Polarization : Signatures
  and Experimental Prospects","Dark matter (DM) annihilation during hydrogen recombination (z ~ 1000) will
alter the recombination history of the Universe, and affect the observed CMB
temperature and polarization fluctuations. Unlike other astrophysical probes of
DM, this is free of the significant uncertainties in modelling galactic
physics, and provides a method to detect and constrain the cosmological
abundances of these particles. We parametrize the effect of DM annihilation as
an injection of ionizing energy at a rate e_{dm}, and argue that this simple
""on the spot'' modification is a good approximation to the complicated
interaction of the annihilation products with the photon-electron plasma.
Generic models of DM do not change the redshift of recombination, but change
the residual ionization after recombination. This broadens the surface of last
scattering, suppressing the temperature fluctuations and enhancing the
polarization fluctuations. We use the temperature and polarization angular
power spectra to measure these deviations from the standard recombination
history, and therefore, indirectly probe DM annihilation. (abridged)",2005-03-23T20:26:19Z
The Devil is in the Details: Compact Structures in Pulsar Wind Nebulae,"The large-scale structure of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) tells us a
considerable amount about their average magnetic fields, the total particle
input from the pulsar winds, and the confining pressure at their outer
boundaries. However, the details of the pulsar outflow, the sites of shocks and
particle acceleration, the effects of instabilities in the magnetic field, and
the interaction between the relativistic wind and the surrounding ejecta are
contained in small-scale structures, where we observe jets and toroidal
structures, time-varying emission from compact clumps, and filaments in both
the inner and outer regions of the nebulae. Here I review recent observational
studies of compact structures in PWNe and present current scenarios (and
questions) regarding their origin.",2005-04-05T12:41:41Z
First detection of dust emission in a High-Velocity Cloud,"By comparing sensitive Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) infrared and Green Bank
Telescope 21 cm observations, we are able to report the first detection of dust
emission in Complex C, the largest High Velocity Cloud in the sky. Dust in the
region of Complex C studied here has a colder temperature
($T=10.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ K - 1$\sigma$) than the local interstellar medium
($T=17.5$ K), in accordance with its great distance from the Galactic plane.
Based on the metallicity measurements and assuming diffuse Galactic
interstellar medium dust properties and dust/metals ratio, this detection could
imply gas column densities more than 5 times higher than observed in HI. We
suggest that the dust emission detected here comes from small molecular clumps,
spatially correlated with the HI but with a low surface filling factor. Our
findings imply that the HVCs' mass would be much larger than inferred from HI
observations and that most of the gas falling on the Milky Way would be in cold
and dense clumps rather than in a diffuse phase.",2005-08-05T12:07:25Z
"A measurement of the polarization-temperature angular cross power
  spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background from the 2003 flight of BOOMERANG","We present a measurement of the temperature-polarization angular cross power
spectrum, <TE>, of the Cosmic Microwave Background. The result is based on
$\sim 200$ hours of data from 8 polarization sensitive bolometers operating at
145 GHz during the 2003 flight of BOOMERANG. We detect a significant <TE>
correlation in the $\ell$-range between 50 and 950 with a statistical
significance > 3.5 sigma. Contamination by polarized foreground emission and
systematic effects are negligible in comparison with statistical uncertainty.
The spectrum is consistent with previous detections and with the ""concordance
model"" that assumes adiabatic initial conditions. This is the first measurement
of <TE> using bolometric detectors.",2005-07-21T13:10:10Z
"The supernova rate-velocity dispersion relation in the interstellar
  medium","We investigate the relationship between the velocity dispersion of the gas
and the SN rate and feedback efficiency in the ISM. We explore the constancy of
the velocity dispersion profiles in the outer parts of galactic disks at~6-8 km
s^-1, and the transition to the starburst regime. Our results show that a) SN
driving leads to constant velocity dispersions of sig~6 km s^-1 for the total
gas and sigHI~3 km s^-1 for the HI gas, independent of the SN rate, for values
of the rate between 0.01-0.5 the Galactic rate R_{G},b) the position of the
transition to the starburst regime at SFR/Area~5*10^-3-10^-2 M_sol yr^-1 kpc^-2
observed in the simulations, is in good agreement with the transition to the
starburst regime in the observations, c) for the high SN rates, no HI gas is
present in the simulations box, however, for the total gas velocity dispersion,
there is good agreement between the models and the observations,d) at the
intermediate SN rates R/R_{G}~0.5-1, taking into account the thermal broadening
of the HI line helps reach a good agreement in that regime between the models
and the observations,e) for R/R_{G}<0.5, sig and sigHI fall below the observed
values by a factor of~2. However, a set of simulation with different values of
epsilon indicates that for larger values of the supernova feedback
efficiencies, velocity dispersions of the HI gas of the order of 5-6 km s^{-1}
can be obtained, in closer agreement with the observations. The fact that for
R/R_{G}<0.5, the HI gas velocity dispersions are a factor ~2 smaller than the
observed values could result from the fact that we might have underestimated
the SN feedback efficiency. It might also be an indication that other physical
processes couple to the stellar feedback in order to produce the observed level
of turbulence in galactic disks.",2005-06-15T11:41:04Z
Bimodal Color Distribution in Hierarchical Galaxy Formation,"We show how the observed bimodality in the color distribution of galaxies can
be explained in the framework of the hierarchical clustering picture in terms
of the interplay between the properties of the merging histories and the
feedback/star-formation processes in the progenitors of local galaxies. Using a
semi-analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation, we compute the color
distributions of galaxies with different luminosities and compare them with the
observations. Our fiducial model matches the fundamental properties of the
observed distributions, namely: 1) the distribution of objects brighter than
M_r = -18 is clearly bimodal, with a fraction of red objects increasing with
luminosity; 2) for objects brighter than M_r = -21 the color distribution is
dominated by red objects with color u-r = 2.2-2.4; 3) the spread on the
distribution of the red population is smaller than that of the blue population;
4) the fraction of red galaxies is larger in denser environments, even for
low-luminosity objects; 5) the bimodality in the distribution persists up to z
= 1.5. We discuss the role of the different physical processes included in the
model in producing the above results.",2005-06-16T15:57:19Z
Spin-Dependent Cyclotron Decay Rates in Strong Magnetic Fields,"Cyclotron decay and absorption rates have been well studied in the
literature, focusing primarily on spectral, angular and polarization
dependence. Astrophysical applications usually do not require retention of
information on the electron spin state, and these are normally averaged in
obtaining the requisite rates. In magnetic fields, higher order quantum
processes such as Compton scattering become resonant at the cyclotron frequency
and its harmonics, with the resonances being formally divergent. Such
divergences are usually eliminated by accounting for the finite lifetimes of
excited Landau states. This practice requires the use of spin-dependent
cyclotron rates in order to obtain accurate determinations of process rates
very near cyclotronic resonances, the phase space domain most relevant for
certain applications to pulsar models. This paper develops previous results in
the literature to obtain compact analytic expressions for cyclotron decay
rates/widths in terms of a series of Legendre functions of the second kind;
these expressions can be expediently used in astrophysical models. The rates
are derived using two popular eigenstate formalisms, namely that due to Sokolov
and Ternov, and that due to Johnson and Lippmann. These constitute two sets of
eigenfunctions of the Dirac equation that diagonalize different operators, and
accordingly yield different spin-dependent cyclotron rates. This paper
illustrates the attractive Lorentz transformation characteristics of the
Sokolov and Ternov formulation, which is another reason why it is preferable
when electron spin information must be explicitly retained.",2005-05-16T17:49:42Z
A survey of NB921 dropouts in the Subaru Deep Field,"In order to search for high-redshift galaxies beyond $z = 6.6$ in the Subaru
Deep Field, we have investigated NB921-dropout galaxies where NB921 is the
narrowband filter centered at 919.6 nm with FWHM of 13.2 nm for the Suprime-Cam
on the Subaru Telescope. There are no secure NB921-dropout candidates brighter
than $z^\prime = 25.5$. Based on this result, we discuss the UV luminosity
function of star-forming galaxies at $z > 6.6$.",2005-07-12T05:25:27Z
"Discovery of a Strongly Lensed Galaxy at z=3.9 behind a z=0.83 Galaxy
  Cluster","We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of three
gravitationally-lensed images of a galaxy at z=3.9 in the background of a
distant, rich cluster of galaxies at z=0.83, on the basis of observations with
Faint Object Camera And Spectrograph (FOCAS) on the Subaru telescope. We
construct a simple lens model of the cluster mass distribution based on Jee et
al.'s weak lensing mass estimates from deep, high-resolution images by Advanced
Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. The lens model can
account simultaneously for the observed image configuration and the flux ratio
of the closer pair located close to the critical curve. The parities of the
three images are also consistent with the lensing hypothesis. Since this galaxy
is apparently bright (i'_{AB} \sim 23.7) for its redshift due to the
magnification, it serves as a good high redshift target on which we can make
extensive and detailed studies based on multi-wavelength imaging and
spectroscopy.",2005-06-30T00:20:26Z
"Early-Time Chromatic Variations in the Wind-Swept Medium of GRB 021211
  and the Faintness of its Afterglow","We present Follow-Up Network for Gamma-Ray Bursts (FUN GRB) Collaboration
observations of the optical afterglow of GRB 021211 made between 143 seconds
and 102 days after the burst. Our unique data set includes the earliest
filtered detections and color information for an afterglow in the pre-Swift
era. We find that the afterglow is best described by (1) propagation through a
wind-swept medium, (2) a cooling break that is blueward of the observed optical
frequencies, and (3) a hard electron energy distribution. However, superimposed
on this ""standard model"" behavior we find significant chromatic variations
within the first few hours after the burst. We consider possible reasons for
these variations, including the possibility that they are due to a dust echo.
Finally, we constrain physical parameters that describe the afterglow and
surrounding medium for a variety of scenarios and find that GRB 021211's
afterglow is faint for a combination of 3-4 reasons: (1) a low fraction of
energy in relativistic electrons, (2) a low density for the wind-swept medium,
implying either a low mass-loss rate and/or a high wind velocity for the
progenitor, (3) a wide opening/viewing angle for the jet, and possibly (4)
moderate source frame extinction. The jet appears to be significantly far from
equipartition and magnetically dominated. More extreme versions of this might
explain the darkness of many afterglows in the Swift era.",2005-05-23T18:03:44Z
An XMM-Newton Study of the Coronae of $σ^2$ Coronae Borealis,"(Abridged) We present results of XMM-Newton observations of the RS CVn binary
$\sigma^2$ Coronae Borealis. The RGS and EPIC MOS2 spectra were simultaneously
fitted with collisional ionization equilibrium plasma models to determine
coronal abundances of various elements. Contrary to the solar first ionization
potential (FIP) effect in which elements with a low FIP are overabundant in the
corona compared to the solar photosphere, and contrary to the ``inverse'' FIP
effect observed in several active RS CVn binaries, coronal abundance ratios in
$\sigma^2$ CrB show a complex pattern as supported by similar findings in the
Chandra HETGS analysis of $\sigma^2$ CrB with a different methodology (Osten et
al. 2003). Low-FIP elements ($<10$ eV) have their abundance ratios relative to
Fe consistent with the solar photospheric ratios, whereas high-FIP elements
have their abundance ratios increase with increasing FIP. We find that the
coronal Fe abundance is consistent with the stellar photospheric value,
indicating that there is no metal depletion in $\sigma^2$ CrB. However, we
obtain a higher Fe absolute abundance than in Osten et al. (2003). Except for
Ar and S, our absolute abundances are about 1.5 times larger than those
reported by Osten et al. (2003). However, a comparison of their model with our
XMM-Newton data (and vice versa) shows that both models work adequately in
general. We find, therefore, no preference for one methodology over the other
to derive coronal abundances. Despite the systematic discrepancy in absolute
abundances, our abundance ratios are very close to those obtained by Osten et
al. (2003). Finally, we confirm the measurement of a low density in \ion{O}{7}
($< 4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), but could not confirm the higher densities
measured in spectral lines formed at higher temperatures.",2005-06-10T16:03:24Z
"Investigating Ca II emission in the RS CVn binary ER Vulpeculae using
  the Broadening Function Formalism","The synchronously rotating G stars in the detached, short-period (0.7 d),
partially eclipsing binary, ER Vul, are the most chromospherically active
solar-type stars known. We have monitored activity in the Ca II H & K reversals
for almost an entire orbit. Rucinski's Broadening Function Formalism allows the
photospheric contribution to be objectively subtracted from the highly blended
spectra. The power of the BF technique is also demonstrated by the good
agreement of radial velocities with those measured by others from less crowded
spectral regions. In addition to strong Ca II emission from the primary and
secondary, there appears to be a high-velocity stream flowing onto the
secondary where it stimulates a large active region on the surface 30 - 40
degrees in advance of the sub-binary longitude. A model light curve with a spot
centered on the same longitude also gives the best fit to the observed light
curve. A flare with approximately 13% more power than at other phases was
detected in one spectrum. We suggest ER Vul may offer a magnified view of the
more subtle chromospheric effects synchronized to planetary revolution seen in
certain `51 Peg'-type systems.",2005-04-20T03:49:53Z
The Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect from Reionization,"During the epoch of reionization, local variations in the ionized fraction
(patchiness) imprint arcminute-scale temperature anisotropies in the CMB
through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. We employ an improved
version of an analytic model of reionization devised in Furlanetto et al.(2004)
to calculate the kSZ anisotropy from patchy reionization. This model uses
extended Press-Schechter theory to determine the distribution and evolution of
HII bubbles and produces qualitatively similar reionization histories to those
seen in recent numerical simulations. We find that the angular power spectrum
of the kSZ anisotropies depends strongly on the size distribution of the HII
bubbles and on the duration of reionization. In addition, we show that upcoming
measurements of the kSZ effect should be able to distinguish between several
popular reionization scenarios. In particular, the amplitude of the patchy
power spectrum for reionization scenarios in which the IGM is significantly
ionized by Population III stars (or by mini-quasars/decaying particles) can be
larger (or smaller) by over a factor of 3 than the amplitude in more
traditional reionization histories (with temperature anisotropies that range
between 0.5 and 3 micro-Kelvin at l = 5000). We highlight the differences in
the kSZ signal between many possible reionization morphologies and discuss the
constraints that future observations of the kSZ will place on this epoch.",2005-04-07T20:00:03Z
The GRB 030328 host: another case of a blue starburst galaxy,"We present for the first time the detection of the GRB 030328 host galaxy in
four optical bands equivalent to UBRI. The host galaxy spectral energy
distribution is consistent with a low extinction (E(B-V) < 0.21) starburst
galaxy. The restframe B-band magnitude of the host is M_B ~ -20.4",2005-04-04T07:57:30Z
The mass of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the missing satellite problem,"We present the results from a suite of N-body simulations of the tidal
stripping of two-component dwarf galaxies comprising some stars and dark
matter. We show that recent kinematic data from the local group dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies suggests that dSph galaxies must be sufficiently
massive ($10^9 - 10^{10}$M$_\odot$) that tidal stripping is of little

galaxies for cosmology and galaxy formation.",2005-05-11T10:55:30Z
High Excitation Molecular Gas in the Magellanic Clouds,"We present the first survey of submillimeter CO 4-3 emission in the
Magellanic Clouds. The survey is comprised of 15 6'x6' maps obtained using the
AST/RO telescope toward the molecular peaks of the Large and Small Magellanic
Clouds. We have used these data to constrain the physical conditions in these
objects, in particular their molecular gas density and temperature. We find
that there are significant amounts of molecular gas associated with most of
these molecular peaks, and that high molecular gas temperatures are pervasive
throughout our sample. We discuss whether this may be due to the low
metallicities and the associated dearth of gas coolants in the Clouds, and
conclude that the present sample is insufficient to assert this effect.",2005-06-23T20:34:03Z
Proper orthogonal decomposition of solar photospheric motions,"The spatio-temporal dynamics of the solar photosphere is studied by
performing a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of line of sight velocity
fields computed from high resolution data coming from the MDI/SOHO instrument.
Using this technique, we are able to identify and characterize the different
dynamical regimes acting in the system. Low frequency oscillations, with
frequencies in the range 20-130 microHz, dominate the most energetic POD modes
(excluding solar rotation), and are characterized by spatial patterns with
typical scales of about 3 Mm. Patterns with larger typical scales of 10 Mm, are
associated to p-modes oscillations at frequencies of about 3000 microHz.",2005-06-27T13:23:12Z
The disk vanishes,"Recently published observations of VY Scl stars in their low,
long-intermediate and high states confirm our model (Hameury & Lasota 2002)
according to which accretion disks in such systems must vanish when their
temperature corresponds to thermally unstable configurations. An observational
confirmation of the hypothesis that the disk disappearance is caused by
magnetic effects would have important consequences for cataclysmic variable
evolution models.",2005-06-16T14:08:19Z
"The 2MASS galaxy angular power spectrum: Probing the galaxy distribution
  to Gigaparsec scales","We present an angular power spectrum analysis of the 2MASS full release
extended source catalogue. The main sample used includes 518,576 galaxies below
an extinction-corrected magnitude of K=13.5 and limited to |b|>20. The power
spectrum results provide an estimate of the galaxy density fluctuations at
extremely large scales, r<1000 Mpc. We compare this with mock predictions
constructed from the LCDM Hubble Volume mock catalogue. We find that over the
range 1<l<100 the 2MASS C_l is steeper than that for the Hubble Volume model.
However, in the linear regime (l<30) there is good agreement between the two.
We investigate in detail the effects of possible sources of systematic error.
Converting linear power spectrum predictions for the form of the
three-dimensional matter power spectrum, P(k), and assuming a flat CDM
cosmology, a primordial n_s=1 spectrum and negligible neutrino mass, we perform
fits to the galaxy angular power spectrum at large linear scales (l<30,
corresponding to r>50 Mpc). We obtain constraints on the galaxy power spectrum
shape of Gamma=0.14+/-0.02, in good agreement with previous estimates inferred
at smaller scales. We also constrain the galaxy power spectrum normalisation to
(sigma_8 b_K)^2=1.36+/-0.10; in combination with previous constraints on
sigma_8 we infer a K-band bias of b_K=1.39+/-0.12. We are also able to provide
weak constraints on Omega_m h and Omega_b/Omega_m. These results are based on
the usual assumption that the errors derived from the Hubble Volume mocks are
applicable to all other models. If we instead assume that the error is
proportional to the C_l amplitude then the constraints weaken; for example it
becomes more difficult to reject cosmologies with lower Gamma.",2005-07-08T18:26:47Z
"Observational Constraints Upon Cool Disk Material in Quiescent Black
  Hole Binaries","We consider current observational constraints on the presence of cool,
optically thick disk material in quiescent black hole binaries, specifically
focusing on a case study of the prototypical system A0620-00. Such material
might be expected to be present theoretically, but is usually claimed to make a
negligible contribution at optical and infrared wavelengths. The primary
argument is based on measurements of the veiling of stellar photospheric
absorption lines, in which it is assumed that the disk spectrum is featureless.
We use simulated spectra to explore the sensitivity of veiling measurements to
uncertainties in companion temperature, gravity, and metallicity. We find that
the derived veiling is extremely sensitive to a mismatch between the
temperature and metallicity of the companion and template, but that the effect
of a plausible gravity mismatch is much smaller. In general the resulting
uncertainty in the amount of veiling is likely to be much larger than the
usually quoted statistical uncertainty. We also simulate spectra in which the
disk has an emergent spectrum similar to the star and find that in this case,
optical veiling constraints are moderately robust. This is because the
rotational broadening of the disk is so large that the two line profiles
effectively decouple and the measurement of the depth of stellar lines is
largely unbiased by the disk component. We note, however, that this is only
true at intermediate resolutions or higher, and that significant bias might
still affect low resolution IR observations. [Abridged]",2005-07-19T21:32:07Z
"INTEGRAL observations of the Be/X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 during
  outburst","We present a type-I outburst of the high-mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375,
detected during INTEGRAL's Performance and Verification Phase in December 2002
(on-source time about 10e+06 seconds). In addition, six more outbursts have
been observed during INTEGRAL's Galactic Plane Scans. X-ray pulsations have
been detected with a pulse period of 41.691798+-0.000016 s. The X-ray
luminosity in the 5-300 keV energy range was 9.7*10e+36 erg/s, for a distance
of 7.1 kpc. Two unusual features were found in the light curve, with an initial
peak before the main outburst and another possible spike after the maximum.
RXTE observations confirm only the existence of the initial spike. Although the
initial peak appears to be a recurrent feature, the physical mechanisms
producing it and the possible second spike are unknown. Moreover, a four-day
delay between periastron passage and the peak of the outburst is observed. We
present for the first time a 5-300 keV broad-band spectrum of this source. It
can be modelled by the sum of a disk black body (kT_bb~8 keV) with either a
power law model with Gamma=2.04+-0.11 keV or a Comptonized component (spherical
geometry, kT_e=30 keV, tau=2.64, kT_W=1.5 keV).",2005-06-21T18:13:07Z
"A Persistent High-Energy Flux from the Heart of the Milky Way :
  Integral's view of the Galactic Center","The Ibis/Isgri imager on Integral detected for the first time a hard X-ray
source, IGR J17456-2901, located within 1' of Sgr A* over the energy range
20-100 keV. Here we present the results of a detailed analysis of ~7 Ms of
Integral observations of the GC. With an effective exposure of 4.7 Ms we have
obtained more stringent positional constraints on this HE source and
constructed its spectrum in the range 20-400 keV. Furthermore, by combining the
Isgri spectrum with the total X-ray spectrum corresponding to the same physical
region around SgrA* from XMM data, and collected during part of the Integral
observations, we constructed and present the first accurate wide band HE
spectrum for the central arcmins of the Galaxy. Our complete analysis of the
emission properties of IGR shows that it is faint but persistent with no
variability above 3 sigma contrary to what was alluded to in our first paper.
This result, in conjunction with the spectral characteristics of the X-ray
emission from this region, suggests that the source is most likely not
point-like but, rather, that it is a compact, yet diffuse, non-thermal emission
region. The centroid of IGR is estimated to be R.A.=17h45m42.5,
decl.=-28deg59'28'', offset by 1' from the radio position of Sgr A* and with a
positional uncertainty of 1'. Its 20-400 keV luminosity at 8 kpc is L=5.4x10^35
erg/sec. Very recently, Hess detected of a source of ~TeV g-rays also located
within 1' of Sgr A*. We present arguments in favor of an interpretation
according to which the photons detected by Integral and Hess arise from the
same compact region of diffuse emission near the central BH and that the
supernova remnant Sgr A East could play an important role as a contributor of
very HE g-rays to the overall spectrum from this region.",2005-08-04T12:45:02Z
"Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics In Dynamical Spacetimes: Numerical
  Methods And Tests","Many problems at the forefront of theoretical astrophysics require the
treatment of magnetized fluids in dynamical, strongly curved spacetimes. Such
problems include the origin of gamma-ray bursts, magnetic braking of
differential rotation in nascent neutron stars arising from stellar core
collapse or binary neutron star merger, the formation of jets and magnetized
disks around newborn black holes, etc. To model these phenomena, all of which
involve both general relativity (GR) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we have
developed a GRMHD code capable of evolving MHD fluids in dynamical spacetimes.
Our code solves the Einstein-Maxwell-MHD system of coupled equations in
axisymmetry and in full 3+1 dimensions. We evolve the metric by integrating the
BSSN equations, and use a conservative, shock-capturing scheme to evolve the
MHD equations. Our code gives accurate results in standard MHD code-test
problems, including magnetized shocks and magnetized Bondi flow. To test our
code's ability to evolve the MHD equations in a dynamical spacetime, we study
the perturbations of a homogeneous, magnetized fluid excited by a gravitational
plane wave, and we find good agreement between the analytic and numerical
solutions.",2005-03-18T21:13:00Z
"Accretion by the Secondary in Eta Carinae During the Spectroscopic
  Event: I. Flow Parameters","We examine the influence of the gravity of the companion (the secondary) to
the massive primary star Eta Carinae on the winds blown by the primary and the
secondary. The two winds collide with each other after passing through two
respective shock waves, and escape the system while strongly emitting in the
X-ray band. While during most of the 5.5 years orbital period, the companion's
gravity has a negligible effect on the winds, we find that near periastron, the
companion's gravity may significantly influence the flow and the companion
might accrete from the primary's wind under certain circumstances. Near
periastron passage, the collision region of the two winds may collapse onto the
secondary star, a process that could substantially reduce the X-ray luminosity.
We suggest that such an accretion process produces the long, almost flat, X-ray
minimum in Eta Carinae.",2005-05-11T03:37:47Z
Can a photometric redshift code reliably determine dust extinction?,"Photometric redshifts can be routinely obtained to accuracies of better than
0.1 in Delta(z)/(1+z). However, the issue of dust extinction is one that has
still not been well quantified. In this paper the success of two
template-fitting photometric redshift codes (IMPZ and HYPERZ) at reliably
returning Av in addition to redshift is explored. New data on the CNOC2
spectroscopic sample of 0.2<z<0.7 galaxies are presented. These data allow us
to estimate Av values from the observed Balmer decrements. We also investigate
whether the empirical value of gamma=0.44, the ratio between gas- and star-
derived extinction, as determined by Calzetti (2001), is necessarily the best
value for this sample.
  When comparing the two codes to the Balmer-derived Av, a correlation between
the photometrically derived Av, Phot-Av, and the Balmer-Av is found. The
correlation is improved when the empirical value of gamma=0.44 is allowed to
vary. From least-squares-fitting the minimum in the reduced chi^2 distribution
is found for gamma~0.25 +/- 0.2. For the sample of galaxies here, the factor of
two difference in covering factor implied by the Calzetti ratio is found to be
plausible. The CNOC2 galaxies with detected Balmer lines have some preference
for an increased covering factor difference, which would perhaps imply they are
undergoing more rapid, `bursty' star formation than the galaxies Calzetti used
in her derivation.",2005-05-05T20:00:16Z
"Dark galaxies or tidal debris? Kinematical clues to the origin of
  massive isolated HI clouds","An extended HI cloud (VIRGOHI 21) with an HI mass of $\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$
and no apparent optical counterpart was recently discovered in the Virgo
cluster. In order to understand the origin of physical properties of apparently
isolated HI clouds like the VIRGOHI21, we numerically investigate physical
properties of tidal HI debris that were formed by galaxy-galaxy interaction in
clusters of galaxies. Our hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that tidal
debris with total HI masses of $10^8-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ can have (1) wide HI
velocity widths ($>200$ km s$^{-1}$), (2) a small mass fraction of stars
($\sim$10%), and (3) a mean $B$-band surface brightness of the stellar
components fainter than 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. These results suggest that the
VIRGOHI21, which lies at a projected distance of $\sim$ 150 kpc from the
one-armed, HI-rich spiral galaxy M99 (NGC 4254), is tidal debris. We propose
that the comparison between the simulated and the observed velocity fields of
HI clouds allows us to better understand their nature and origin (e.g., whether
they are just tidal debris or ``dark galaxies'' that have HI gas only and are
embedded by dark matter halos). We also discuss the timescales for isolated HI
gas to be evaporated by thermal conduction of the hot intracluster gas.",2005-05-29T09:56:21Z
Rotation in Gravitational Lenses,"Gravitational lensing deflects light. A single lens deflector can only shear
images, but cannot induce rotations. Multiple lens planes can induce rotations.
Such rotations can be observed in quadruply imaged sources, and can be used to
distinguish between two proposed solutions of the flux anomaly problem:
substructures in lensing galaxies vs large scale structure. We predict the
expected amount of rotation due to large scale structure in strong lensing
systems, and show how this effect can be measured using ~ mas VLBI astrometry
of quadruple lenses with extended source structures. The magnitude of rotation
is around one degree. The biggest theoretical uncertainty is the power spectrum
of dark matter on very small scales. This procedure can potentially be turned
around to measure the dark matter power spectrum on very small scales. We list
the predicted RMS rotation angles for several quadruple lenses with known lens
and source redshifts.",2005-06-02T10:47:47Z
High-Ionization Emission in Metal-Deficient Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxies,"Primordial stars are expected to be very massive and hot, producing copious
amounts of hard ionizing radiation. The best place to study hard ionizing
radiation in the local universe is in very metal-deficient Blue Compact Dwarf
(BCD) galaxies. We have carried out a MMT spectroscopic search for [Ne V] 3426
(ionization potential of 7.1 Ryd), [Fe V] 4227 (ionization potential of 4 Ryd)
and He II 4686 (ionization potential of 4 Ryd) emission in a sample of 18 BCDs.
We have added data from previous work and from the Data Release 3 of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. In total, we have assembled a BCD high-ionization sample
with [Ne V] emission in 4 galaxies, [Fe V] emission in 15 galaxies and He II
emission in 465 galaxies. With this large sample, we have reached the following
conclusions. There is a general trend of higher [Ne V], [Fe V] and He II
emission at lower metallicities. However metallicity is not the only factor
which controls the hardness of the radiation. High-mass X-ray binaries and
main-sequence stars are probably excluded as the main sources of the very hard
ionizing radiation responsible for [Ne V] emission. The most likely source of
[Ne V] emission is probably fast radiative shocks moving with velocities > 450
km/s through a dense interstellar medium with an electron number density of
several hundreds per cm^-3 and associated with supernova explosions of the most
massive stars. These have masses of ~ 50 - 100 Msun and are formed in very
compact super-star clusters. The softer ionizing radiation required for He II
emission is likely associated with less massive evolved stars and/or radiative
shocks moving through a less dense interstellar medium.",2005-07-08T15:20:48Z
The first near infrared detection of XTE J1118+480 in quiescence,"We report the first quiescent detection of KV UMa, the optical counterpart of
XTE J1118+480 at near infrared. The observed magnitudes and colours are
consistent with a K7-M0 V star, at the distance 1.4 +/- 0.2 kpc. The light
curve shows strong orbital modulation with possible contamination from a
superhump detected in the quiescent optical light curves.",2005-05-26T12:54:06Z
Young Neutron Stars and Their Wind Nebulae,"With Teragauss magnetic fields, surface gravity sufficiently strong to
significantly modify light paths, central densities higher than that of a
standard nucleus, and rotation periods of only hundredths of a second, young
neutron stars are sites of some of the most extreme physical conditions known
in the Universe. They generate magnetic winds with particles that are
accelerated to energies in excess of a TeV. These winds form
synchrotron-emitting bubbles as the particle stream is eventually decelerated
to match the general expansion caused by the explosion that formed the neutron
stars. The structure of these pulsar wind nebulae allow us to infer properties
of the winds and the pulsating neutron stars themselves. The surfaces of the
the stars radiate energy from the rapidly cooling interiors where the physical
structure is basically unknown because of our imprecise knowledge of the strong
interaction at ultrahigh densities. Here I present a summary of recent
measurements that allow us to infer the birth properties of neutron stars and
to probe the nature of their winds, the physics of their atmospheres, and the
structure of their interiors.",2005-05-24T21:03:30Z
"On the nature of Lithium-rich giant stars: constraints from Beryllium
  abundances","We have derived beryllium abundances for 7 Li-rich giant (A(Li) > 1.5) stars
and 10 other Li-normal giants, with the aim of investigating the origin of the
Lithium in the Li-rich giants. In particular, we test the predictions of the
engulfment scenario proposed by Siess & Livio (1999), where the engulfment of a
brown dwarf or one or more giant planets would lead to a simultaneous
enrichment of 7Li and 9Be. We show that regardless their nature, none of the
stars studied in this paper were found to have detectable beryllium. Using
simple dilution arguments we show that the engulfment of an external object as
the sole source of Li enrichment is ruled out by the Li and Be abundance data.
The present results favor the idea that Li has been produced in the interior of
the stars by a Cameron-Fowler process and brought up to the surface by an extra
mixing mechanism.",2005-04-06T00:31:48Z
Methanol emission from low mass protostars,"We present observations of methanol lines in a sample of Class 0 low mass
protostars. Using a 1-D radiative transfer model, we derive the abundances in
the envelopes. In two sources of the sample, the observations can only be
reproduced by the model if the methanol abundance is enhanced by about two
order of magnitude in the inner hot region of the envelope. Two other sources
show similar jumps, although at a lower confidence level. The observations for
the other three sources are well reproduced with a constant abundance, but the
presence of a jump cannot be ruled out. The observed methanol abundances in the
warm gas around low mass protostars are orders of magnitude higher than gas
phase chemistry models predict. Hence, in agreement with other evidences, this
suggest that the high methanol abundance reflects recent evaporation of ices
due to the heating by the newly formed star. The observed abundance ratios of
CH3 OH, H2 CO, and CO are in good agreement with grain surface chemistry
models. However, the absolute abundances are more difficult to reproduce and
may point towards the presence of multiple ice components in these regions.",2005-07-07T15:10:09Z
"Black hole-neutron star binaries in general relativity: effects of
  neutron star spin","We present new sequences of general relativistic, quasiequilibrium black
hole-neutron star binaries. We solve for the gravitational field in the
conformal thin-sandwich decomposition of Einstein's field equations, coupled to
the equations of relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium for a perfect fluid. We
account for the black hole by solving these equations in the background metric
of a Schwarzschild black hole whose mass is much larger than that of the
neutron star. The background metric is treated in Kerr-Schild as well as
isotropic coordinates. For the neutron star, we assume a polytropic equation of
state with adiabatic index Gamma=2, and solve for both irrotational and
corotational configurations. By comparing the results of irrotational and
synchronized configurations with the same background metric, we conclude that
the effect of the rotation on the location of tidal break-up is only on the
order of a few percent. The different choices in the background also lead to
differences of order a few percent, which may be an indication of the level to
which these configurations approximate quasiequilibrium.",2005-05-20T20:00:12Z
Neutrino Processes in Strong Magnetic Fields,"The processes of electron neutrino capture on neutron and electron
anti-neutrino capture on proton, and their reverse processes provide the
dominant mechanisms for heating and cooling the material below the stalled
shock in a core-collapse supernova. We summarize the major effects of strong
magnetic fields on the rates of the above reactions and illustrate these
effects with a simple supernova model. Due to parity violation of weak
interaction the heating rates are asymmetric even for a uniform magnetic field.
The cooling rates are also asymmetric for nonuniform fields. The most dramatic
effect of strong magnetic fields of 10^16 G is suppression of the cooling rates
by changing the equations of state through the phase space of electrons and
positrons.",2005-06-07T00:31:58Z
Gravitational evolution of a perturbed lattice and its fluid limit,"We apply a simple linearization, well known in solid state physics, to
approximate the evolution at early times of cosmological N-body simulations of
gravity. In the limit that the initial perturbations, applied to an infinite
perfect lattice, are at wavelengths much greater than the lattice spacing $l$
the evolution is exactly that of a pressureless self-gravitating fluid treated
in the analagous (Lagrangian) linearization, with the Zeldovich approximation
as a sub-class of asymptotic solutions. Our less restricted approximation
allows one to trace the evolution of the discrete distribution until the time
when particles approach one another (i.e. ``shell crossing''). We calculate
modifications of the fluid evolution, explicitly dependent on $l$ i.e.
discreteness effects in the N body simulations. We note that these effects
become increasingly important as the initial red-shift is increased at fixed
$l$. The possible advantages of using a body centred cubic, rather than simple
cubic, lattice are pointed out.",2005-04-08T18:03:24Z
"Metal abundances in extremely distant Galactic old open clusters. II.
  Berkeley 22 and Berkeley 66","We report on high resolution spectroscopy of four giant stars in the Galactic
old open clusters Berkeley~22 and Berkeley~66 obtained with HIRES at the Keck
telescope. We find that $[Fe/H]=-0.32\pm0.19$ and $[Fe/H]=-0.48\pm0.24$ for
Berkeley~22 and Berkeley~66, respectively. Based on these data, we first revise
the fundamental parameters of the clusters, and then discuss them in the
context of the Galactic disk radial abundance gradient. We found that both
clusters nicely obey the most updated estimate of the slope of the gradient
from \citet{fri02} and are genuine Galactic disk objects.",2005-04-13T14:06:09Z
"Discovery of an M4 Spectroscopic Binary in Upper Scorpius: A Calibration
  Point for Young Low-Mass Evolutionary Models","We report the discovery of a new low-mass spectroscopic (SB2) stellar binary
system in the star-forming region of Upper Scorpius. This object, UScoCTIO5,
was discovered by Ardila (2000), who assigned it a spectral class of M4. A
KeckI HIRES spectrum revealed it to be double-lined, and we then carried out a
program at several observatories to determine its orbit. The orbital period is
34 days, and the eccentricity is nearly 0.3. The importance of such a discovery
is that it can be used to help calibrate evolutionary models at low masses and
young ages. This is one of the outstanding problems in the study of formation
mechanisms and initial mass functions at low masses. The orbit allows us to
place a lower limit of 0.64 +- 0.02 M_sol on the total system mass. The
components appear to be of almost equal mass. We are able to show that this
mass is significantly higher than predicted by evolutionary models for an
object of this luminosity and age, in agreement with other recent results. More
precise determination of the temperature and surface gravity of the components
would be helpful in further solidifying this conclusion.",2005-06-21T17:14:38Z
"Rates of Neutrino Absorption on Nucleons and the Reverse Processes in
  Strong Magnetic Fields","The rates of electron neutrino capture on neutron, electron anti-neutrino
capture on proton, and their reverse processes are important for understanding
the production of heavy elements in the supernova environment above the
protoneutron star. Observations and theoretical considerations suggest that
some protoneutron stars may be born with strong magnetic fields. We develop a
numerical method to calculate the above rates in supernova environments with
magnetic fields up to 10^16 G. This method is accurate to the order of one over
nucleon mass. We show that our results have the correct behavior in the limit
of high neutrino energy or small magnetic field. Based on comparison of our
results with various approximations, we recommend efficient estimates of the
above rates for use in models of supernova nucleosynthesis in the presence of
strong magnetic fields.",2005-06-01T20:26:43Z
The Discovery of Spiral Arms in the Starburst Galaxy M82,"We report the discovery of two symmetric spiral arms in the near-infrared
(NIR) images of the starburst galaxy M82. The spiral arms are recovered when an
axi-symmetric exponential disk is subtracted from the NIR images. The arms
emerge from the ends of the NIR bar and can be traced up to three disk
scalelengths. The winding of the arms is consistent with an m=2 logarithmic
spiral mode of pitch angle 14 degrees. The arms are bluer than the disk in
spite of their detection on the NIR images. If the northern side of the galaxy
is nearer to us, as is normally assumed, the observed sense of rotation implies
trailing arms. The nearly edge-on orientation, high disk surface brightness,
and the presence of a complex network of dusty filaments in the optical images,
are responsible for the lack of detection of the arms in previous studies.",2005-06-13T15:34:25Z
Prospects for Redshifted 21-cm observations of quasar HII regions,"The introduction of low-frequency radio arrays over the coming decade is
expected to revolutionize the study of the reionization epoch. Observation of
the contrast in redshifted 21cm emission between a large HII region and the
surrounding neutral IGM will be the simplest and most easily interpreted
signature. We find that an instrument like the planned Mileura Widefield Array
Low-Frequency Demonstrator (LFD) will be able to obtain good signal to noise on
HII regions around the most luminous quasars, and determine some gross
geometric properties, e.g. whether the HII region is spherical or conical. A
hypothetical follow-up instrument with 10 times the collecting area of the LFD
(MWA-5000) will be capable of mapping the detailed geometry of HII regions,
while SKA will be capable of detecting very narrow spectral features as well as
the sharpness of the HII region boundary. The MWA-5000 will discover
serendipitous HII regions in widefield observations. We estimate the number of
HII regions which are expected to be generated by quasars. Assuming a late
reionization at z~6 we find that there should be several tens of quasar HII
regions larger than 4Mpc at z~6-8 per field of view. Identification of HII
regions in forthcoming 21cm surveys can guide a search for bright galaxies in
the middle of these regions. Most of the discovered galaxies would be the
massive hosts of dormant quasars that left behind fossil HII cavities that
persisted long after the quasar emission ended, owing to the long recombination
time of intergalactic hydrogen. A snap-shot survey of candidate HII regions
selected in redshifted 21cm image cubes may prove to be the most efficient
method for finding very high redshift quasars and galaxies.",2005-06-02T04:27:16Z
"Star Formation in NGC5194 (M51a): The Panchromatic View from GALEX to
  Spitzer","(Abridged) Far ultraviolet to far infrared images of the nearby galaxy
NGC5194, from Spitzer, GALEX, Hubble Space Telescope and ground--based data,
are used to investigate local and global star formation, and the impact of dust
extinction in HII-emitting knots. In the IR/UV-UV color plane, the NGC5194 HII
knots show the same trend observed for normal star-forming galaxies, having a
much larger dispersion than starburst galaxies. We identify the dispersion as
due to the UV emission predominantly tracing the evolved, non-ionizing stellar
population, up to ages 50-100 Myr. While in starbursts the UV light traces the
current SFR, in NGC5194 it traces a combination of current and recent-past SFR.
Unlike the UV emission, the monochromatic 24 micron luminosity is an accurate
local SFR tracer for the HII knots in NGC5194; this suggests that the 24 micron
emission carriers are mainly heated by the young, ionizing stars. However,
preliminary results show that the ratio of the 24 micron emission to the SFR
varies by a factor of a few from galaxy to galaxy. While also correlated with
star formation, the 8 micron emission is not directly proportional to the
number of ionizing photons. This confirms earlier suggestions that the carriers
of the 8 micron emission are heated by more than one mechanism.",2005-07-19T04:18:10Z
"Positive deconvolution for superimposed extended source and point
  sources","The paper deals with the construction of images from visibilities acquired
using aperture synthesis instruments: Fourier synthesis, deconvolution, and
spectral interpolation/extrapolation. Its intended application is to specific
situations in which the imaged object possesses two superimposed components:
($i$) an extended component together with ($ii$) a set of point sources. It is
also specifically designed to the case of positive maps, and accounts for a
known support. Its originality lies within joint estimation of the two
components, coherently with data, properties of each component, positivity and
possible support. We approach the subject as an inverse problem within a
regularization framework: a regularized least-squares criterion is specifically
proposed and the estimated maps are defined as its minimizer. We have
investigated several options for the numerical minimization and we propose a
new efficient algorithm based on augmented Lagrangian. Evaluation is carried
out using simulated and real data (from radio interferometry) demonstrating the
capability to accurately separate the two components.",2005-07-29T10:55:46Z
Evolution of reconnection along an arcade of magnetic loops,"RHESSI observations of a solar flare showing continuous motions of double
hard X-ray sources interpreted as footpoints of magnetic loops are presented.
The temporal evolution shows many distinct emission peaks of duration of some
tens of seconds ('elementary flare bursts'). Elementary flare bursts have been
interpreted as instabilities or oscillations of the reconnection process
leading to an unsteady release of magnetic energy. These interpretations based
on two-dimensional concepts cannot explain these observations, showing that the
flare elements are displaced in a third dimension along the arcade. Therefore,
the observed flare elements are not a modulation of the reconnection process,
but originate as this process progresses along an arcade of magnetic loops.
Contrary to previous reports, we find no correlation between footpoint motion
and hard X-ray flux. This flare apparently contradicts the predictions of the
standard translation invariant 2.5D reconnection models.",2005-04-20T10:30:20Z
Search for H3+ in HD141569A,"A search for H3+ line emission, reported to have been detected toward the
young star HD 141569A and possibly originating in a clump of planet-forming gas
orbiting the star, has yielded negative results. Observations made at the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and at the Subaru Telescope during 2001-2005
covered 11 major transitions of H3+ from 3.42 to 3.99 um. No H3+ emission lines
were detected; one marginal detection at 3.9855 um in June 2002 was not
confirmed in later spectra. The upper limits to the line strengths are
significantly lower than the previously reported detections. Supplemental
slit-scanning spectroscopy using adaptive optics was performed within 0.38 of
HD 141569A to search for extended emission from H3+, but no emission was
detected. We compare our upper limit to the luminosity in H3+ from HD 141569A
with that possible from a gas giant protoplanet and also from a jovian mass
exoplanet in close orbit about its central star.",2005-04-22T22:42:34Z
"Astrometric Microlensing Constraints on a Massive Body in the Outer
  Solar System with Gaia","A body in Solar orbit beyond the Kuiper belt exhibits an annual parallax that
exceeds its apparent proper motion by up to many orders of magnitude. Apparent
motion of this body along the parallactic ellipse will deflect the angular
position of background stars due to astrometric microlensing (""induced
parallax""). By synoptically sampling the astrometric position of background
stars over the entire sky, constraints on the existence (and basic properties)
of a massive nearby body may be inferred. With a simple simulation, we estimate
the signal-to-noise for detecting such a body -- as function of mass,
heliocentric distance, and ecliptic latitude -- using the anticipated
sensitivity and temporal cadences from Gaia (launch 2011). A Jupiter-mass
(M_Jup) object at 2000 AU is detectable by Gaia over the whole sky above
5-sigma, with even stronger constraints if it lies near the ecliptic plane.
Hypotheses for the mass (~3M_Jup), distance (~20,000 AU) and location of the
proposed perturber (""Planet X"") which gives rise to long-period comets may be
testable.",2005-06-17T20:41:34Z
"The Long Term Optical Variability of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714:
  Evidence for a Precessing Jet","We present the historic light curve of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714,
spanning the time interval from 1953 to 2003, built using Asiago archive plates
and our recent CCD observations, together with literature data. The source
shows an evident long term variability, over which well known short term
variations are superposed. In particular, in the period from 1961 to 1983 the
mean brightness of S5 0716+714 remained significantly fainter than that
observed after 1994. Assuming a constant variation rate of the mean magnitude
we can estimate a value of about 0.11 magnitude/year. The simultaneous
occurrence of decreasing ejection velocities of superluminal moving components
in the jet reported by Bach et al. (2005) suggests that both phenomena are
related to the change of the direction of the jet to the line of sight from
about 5 to 0.7 degrees for an approximately constant bulk Lorentz factor of
about 12. A simple explanation is that of a precessing relativistic jet, which
should presently be close to the smallest orientation angle. One can therefore
expect in the next ten years a decrease of the mean brightness of about 1
magnitude.",2005-06-08T14:56:25Z
"A Gas-poor Planetesimal Capture Model for the Formation of Giant Planet
  Satellite Systems","Assuming that an unknown mechanism (e.g., gas turbulence) removes most of the
subnebula gas disk in a timescale shorter than that for satellite formation, we
develop a model for the formation of regular (and possibly at least some of the
irregular) satellites around giant planets in a gas-poor environment. In this
model, which follows along the lines of the work of Safronov et al. (1986),
heliocentric planetesimals collide within the planet's Hill sphere and generate
a circumplanetary disk of prograde and retrograde satellitesimals extending as
far out as $\sim R_H/2$. At first, the net angular momentum of this
proto-satellite swarm is small, and collisions among satellitesimals leads to
loss of mass from the outer disk, and delivers mass to the inner disk (where
regular satellites form) in a timescale $\lesssim 10^5$ years. This mass loss
may be offset by continued collisional capture of sufficiently small $< 1$ km
interlopers resulting from the disruption of planetesimals in the feeding zone
of the giant planet. As the planet's feeding zone is cleared in a timescale
$\lesssim 10^5$ years, enough angular momentum may be delivered to the
proto-satellite swarm to account for the angular momentum of the regular
satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.(abridged)",2005-04-28T20:20:34Z
"The Magnetic Field of the Large Magellanic Cloud: A New Way of Studying
  Galactic Magnetism","We present a study of the Faraday rotation of extragalactic sources lying
behind the Large Magellanic Cloud. These data represent the most detailed study
yet of magnetic field structures in any external galaxy, and are a
demonstration of how magnetic fields in galaxies will best be studied with
future instruments.",2005-03-16T21:23:59Z
The Excess Far-Infrared Emission of AGN in the Local Universe,"We have cross-correlated the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) second data
release spectroscopic galaxy sample with the IRAS faint-source catalogue (FSC).
Optical emission line ratios are used to classify the galaxies with reliable
IRAS 60 and 100 microns detections into AGN and normal star-forming galaxies.
We then create subsamples of normal galaxies and AGN that are very closely
matched in terms of key physical properties such as stellar mass, redshift,
size, concentration and mean stellar age (as measured by absorption line
indicators in the SDSS spectra). We then quantify whether there are systematic
differences between the IR luminosities of the galaxies and the AGN in the
matched subsamples. We find that the AGN exhibit a significant excess in far-IR
emission relative to the star-forming galaxies in our sample. The excesses at
60 and 100 microns are 0.21 +/- 0.03 dex and 0.12 +/- 0.035 dex in
log[L(60)/M*] and log[L(100)/M*], respectively. We then discuss whether the
far-IR excess is produced by radiation from the active nucleus that is absorbed
by dust or alternatively, by an extra population of young stars that is not
detectable at optical wavelengths.",2005-06-16T14:42:00Z
"The extremely asymmetric radio structure of the z=3.1 radio galaxy B3
  J2330+3927","We report on 1.7 and 5.0 GHz observations of the z=3.087 radio galaxy B3
J2330+3927, using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), and archival 1.4 and 8.4
GHz Very Large Array (VLA) data. Our VLBA data identify a compact, flat
spectrum (\alpha_{1.7 GHz}^{5 GHz} = -0.2 +/- 0.1; S_\nu ~ \nu^\alpha) radio
component as the core. The VLA images show that the fraction of core emission
is very large (f_c \approx 0.5 at 8.4 GHz), and reveal a previously undetected,
very faint counterjet, implying a radio lobe flux density ratio R >= 11 and a
radio lobe distance ratio Q \approx 1.9. Those values are much more common in
quasars than in radio galaxies, but the optical/near-IR spectra show a clear
type II AGN for B3 J2330+3927, confirming that it is indeed a radio galaxy.
Unlike all other radio galaxies, the bright Ly-\alpha emitting gas is located
towards the furthest radio arm. We argue against environmental and relativistic
beaming effects being the cause of the observed asymmetry, and suggest this
source has intrinsically asymmetric radio jets. If this is the case, B3
J2330+3927 is the first example of such a source at high redshift, and seems to
be difficult to reconcile with the unified model, which explains the
differences between quasars and radio galaxies as being due to orientation
effects.",2005-07-20T20:01:07Z
"Exploring a deep meridional flow hypothesis for a circulation dominated
  solar dynamo model","Circulation-dominated solar dynamo models, which employ a helioseismic
rotation profile and a fixed meridional flow, give a good approximation to the
large scale solar magnetic phenomena, such as the 11-year cycle or the so
called Hale's law of polarities. Nevertheless, the larger amplitude of the
radial shear at the high latitudes makes the dynamo to produce a strong
toroidal magnetic field at high latitudes, in contradiction with the
observations of the sunspots (Sporer`s Law). A possible solution was proposed
by Nandy and Choudhur (2002) in which a deep meridional flow can conduct the
magnetic field inside of a stable layer (the radiative core) and then allow
that it erupts just at lower latitudes. We have recently explored this
hypothesis in a different approximation, using the magnetic buoyancy mechanism
proposed by Dikpaty and Charbonneau (1999) and found that a deep meridional
flow pushes the maximum of the toroidal magnetic field towards the solar
equator, but, in contrast to Nandy and Choudhuri (2002), a second zone of
maximum fields remains at the poles (Guerrero and Munoz (2004)). We here review
these results and also discuss a new possible scenario where the tachocline has
an ellipsoidal shape, following early helioseismologic observations Charbonneau
et. al., (1999), and find that the modification of the geometry of the
tachocline can lead to results which are in good agreement with observations
and opens the possibility to explore in more detail, through the dynamo model,
the place where the magnetic field could be really stored.",2005-04-04T18:55:11Z
Dust Extinction in Compact Planetary Nebulae,"The effects of dust extinction on the departure from axi-symmetry in the
morphology of planetary nebulae (PNs) are investigated through a comparison of
the radio free-free emission and hydrogen recombination line images. The dust
exctinction maps of five compact PNs are derived using high-resolution (~ 0"".1)
H-alpha and radio images maps of the HST and VLA. These extinction maps are
then analyzed by an ellipsoidal shell ionization model including the effects of
dust extinction to infer the nebulae's intrinsic structure and orientation in
the sky. This method provides a quantitative analysis of the morphological
structure of PNs and represents a step beyond qualitative classification of
morphological types of PNs.",2005-06-21T21:42:57Z
On the detection of chemically peculiar stars using Delta a photometry,"We have summarized all Delta a measurements for galactic field stars (1474
objects) from the literature published over more than two decades. These
measurements were, for the first time, compiled and homogeneously analyzed. The
Delta a intermediate band photometric system samples the depth of the 520nm
flux depression by comparing the flux at the center with the adjacent regions
with bandwidths of 11 to 23nm. Because it was slightly modified over the last
three decades, we checked for systematic trends for the different measurements
but found no correlations whatsoever. The Delta a photometric system is most
suitable to detecting magnetic chemically peculiar (CP) stars with high
efficiency, but is also capable of detecting a small percentage of non-magnetic
CP objects. Furthermore, the groups of (metal-weak) lambda Bootis, as well as
classical Be/shell stars, can be successfully investigated. In addition, we
also analyzed the behaviour of supergiants (luminosity class I and II). On the
basis of apparent normal type objects, the correlation of the three sigma
significance limit and the percentage of positive detection for all groups was
derived. We compared the capability of the Delta a photometric system with the
Delta (V1 - G) and Z indices of the Geneva 7-color system to detect peculiar
objects. Both photometric systems show the same efficiency for the detection of
CP and lambda Bootis stars, while the indices in the Geneva system are even
more efficient at detecting Be/shell objects. On the basis of this statistical
analysis it is possible to derive the incidence of CP stars in galactic open
cluster and extragalactic systems including the former unknown bias of
undetected objects.",2005-07-06T09:43:36Z
"Comments on ""Angular Momentum Transport in Quasi-Keplerian Accretion
  Disks""","Subramanian, Pujari and Becker (2004) claim that the correct expression for
the angular momentum transport in an accretion disc, which is proportional to
dOmega/dR, can be derived on the basis of the analysis of the epicyclic motion
of gas parcels in adjacent eddies in the disc. We study their argument and show
that their derivation contains several fundamental errors: 1) the biased choice
of the desired formula from an infinite number of formulae; 2) the biased
choice of parcel trajectories; and 3) confusion regarding the reference frames.
Following 1) we could derive, for example, a (invalid) formula in which the
angular momentum transport is proportional to dv_phi/dR, and from 2) we could
even prove that the angular momentum transport is either inward or null. We
present the correct approach to the problem of angular momentum transport in an
accretion disc in terms of mean free path theory.",2005-05-23T04:03:33Z
A Spectroscopic Study of HL Canis Majoris,"We present optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova HL Canis Majoris over a
span of four years. The observations were made during standstill, outburst, and
quiescence. We determine an orbital period of 0.2167867 +/- 0.0000017 days,
based on radial velocities determined from H-alpha, H-beta, and He I 5876
emission. We also present equivalent widths of the spectral features in
outburst and in quiescence.",2005-06-02T22:01:15Z
"Distance determinations using type II supernovae and the expanding
  photosphere method","Due to their high intrinsic brightness, type II supernovae (SN) can be used
as lighthouses to constrain distances in the Universe using variants of the
Baade-Wesselink method. Based on a large set of CMFGEN models (Hillier & Miller
1998) covering the photospheric phase of type II SN, we study the various
concepts entering one such technique, the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM).
We compute correction factors $\xi$ needed to approximate the synthetic
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) with that of a blackbody at temperature $T$.
Our $\xi$, although similar, are systematically greater, by $\sim 0.1$, than
the values obtained by Eastman et al. (1996). This translate into a systematic
enhancement of 10-20% in EPM-distances. We find that line emission and
absorption, not directly linked to color temperature variations, can
considerably alter the synthetic magnitude, and cause above-unity $\xi$-values.
Optically-thick lines, present in the optical at late-times, can also introduce
a strong wavelength-dependence of the photospheric radius, invalidating the use
of the Baade method. Both the impact of line-blanketing on the SED and the
photospheric radius at low $T$ suggest that the EPM is best used at early
times, when the outflow is fully ionized and line-opacity mostly confined to
the UV range. We also investigate how reliably one can measure the photospheric
velocity from P-Cygni line profiles. Contrary to the usually held belief, the
velocity at maximum absorption in the P-Cygni trough of optically-thick lines
can both {\it overestimate or underestimate} the photospheric velocity, with a
magnitude that depends on the SN outflow density gradient and the optical
thickness of the line.",2005-05-23T02:18:30Z
"Discovery of Multiply Imaged Galaxies behind the Cluster and Lensed
  Quasar SDSS J1004+4112","We have identified three multiply imaged galaxies in Hubble Space Telescope
images of the redshift z=0.68 cluster responsible for the large-separation
quadruply lensed quasar, SDSS J1004+4112. Spectroscopic redshifts have been
secured for two of these systems using the Keck I 10m telescope. The most
distant lensed galaxy, at z=3.332, forms at least four images, and an Einstein
ring encompassing 3.1 times more area than the Einstein ring of the lensed QSO
images at z=1.74, due to the greater source distance. For a second multiply
imaged galaxy, we identify Ly_alpha emission at a redshift of z=2.74. The
cluster mass profile can be constrained from near the center of the brightest
cluster galaxy, where we observe both a radial arc and the fifth image of the
lensed quasar, to the Einstein radius of the highest redshift galaxy, ~110 kpc.
Our preliminary modeling indicates that the mass approximates an elliptical
body, with an average projected logarithmic gradient of ~-0.5. The system is
potentially useful for a direct measurement of world models in a previously
untested redshift range.",2005-07-14T23:00:56Z
"Coverage and large scale anisotropies estimation methods for the Pierre
  Auger Observatory","When searching for anisotropies in the arrival directions of Ultra High
Energy Cosmic Rays, one must estimate the number of events expected in each
direction of the sky in the case of a perfect isotropy. We present in this
article a new method, developed for the Auger Observatory, based on a smooth
estimate of the zenith angle distribution obtained from the data itself (which
is essentially unchanged in the case of the presence of a large scale
anisotropy pattern). We also study the sensitivity of several methods to detect
large-scale anisotropies in the cosmic ray arrival direction distribution :
Rayleigh analysis, dipole fitting and angular power spectrum estimation.",2005-07-21T15:33:29Z
Cosmic Backgrounds from Miniquasars,"A large population of Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) might be produced
at early cosmic times as a left over of the evolution of the very massive first
stars. Accretion onto IMBHs provides a source of (re)ionizing radiation. We
show that the baryon mass fraction locked into IMBHs and their growth is
strongly constrained by the observed residual Soft X-ray Background (SXRB)
intensity. Thus, unless they are extremely X-ray quiet, miniquasars must be
quite rare and/or have a short shining phase. As a byproduct, we find that
miniquasars can not be the only source of reionization and that their alleged
contribution to the near infrared bands is completely negligible.",2005-07-08T14:25:35Z
"Detection of gravity waves by phase modulation of the light from a
  distant star","We propose a novel method for detecting gravitational waves (GW), where a
light signal emitted from a distant star interacts with a local (also distant)
GW source and travels towards the Earth, where it is detected. While traveling
in the field of the GW, the light acquires specific phase modulation (which we
account in the eikonal approximation). This phase modulation can be considered
as a coherent spreading of the given initial photons energy over a set of
satellite lines, spaced at the frequency of GW (from quantum point of view it
is multi-graviton absorption and emission processes). This coherent state of
photons with the energy distributed among the set of equidistant lines, can be
analyzed and identified on Earth either by passing the signal through a
Fabry-Perot filter or by monitoring the intensity-intensity correlations at
different times.",2005-06-24T16:03:47Z
High excitation ISM and gas,"An overview is given of ISO results on regions of high excitation ISM and

A new reduction of the raw Hipparcos data,"We present an outline of a new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data,
the justifications of which are described in the accompanying paper. The
emphasis is on those aspects of the data analysis that are fundamentally
different from the ones used for the catalogue published in 1997. The new
reduction uses a dynamical modelling of the satellite's attitude. It
incorporates provisions for scan-phase discontinuities and hits, most of which
have now been identified. Solutions for the final along-scan attitude (the
reconstruction of the satellite's scan phase), the abscissa corrections and the
instrument model, originally solved simultaneously in the great-circle
solution, are now de-coupled. This is made possible by starting the solution
iterations with the astrometric data from the published catalogue. The
de-coupling removes instabilities that affected great-circle solutions for
short data sets in the published data. The modelling-noise reduction implies
smaller systematic errors, which is reflected in a reduction of the
abscissa-error correlations by about a factor 40. Special care is taken to
ensure that measurements from both fields of view contribute significantly to
the along-scan attitude solution. This improves the overall connectivity of the
data and rigidity of the reconstructed sky, which is of critical importance to
the reliability of the astrometric data. The changes in the reduction process
and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the satellite result in
considerable formal-error reductions for stars brighter than 8th magnitude.",2005-05-20T09:19:26Z
Large-Scale Anisotropy of EGRET Gamma Ray Sources,"In the course of its operation, the EGRET experiment detected high-energy
gamma ray sources at energies above 100 MeV over the whole sky. In this
communication, we search for large-scale anisotropy patterns among the
catalogued EGRET sources using an expansion in spherical harmonics, accounting
for EGRET's highly non-uniform exposure. We find significant excess in the
quadrupole and octopole moments. This is consistent with the hypothesis that,
in addition to the galactic plane, a second mid-latitude (5^{\circ} < |b| <
30^{\circ}) population, perhaps associated with the Gould belt, contributes to
the gamma ray flux above 100 MeV.",2005-06-24T14:11:14Z
Once-ionized helium in superstrong magnetic fields,"It is generally believed that magnetic fields of some neutron stars, the
so-called magnetars, are enormously strong, up to 10^{14} - 10^{15} G. Recent
investigations have shown that the atmospheres of magnetars are possibly
composed of helium. We calculate the structure and bound-bound radiative
transitions of the He^+ ion in superstrong fields, including the effects caused
by the coupling of the ion's internal degrees of freedom to its center-of-mass
motion. We show that He^+ in superstrong magnetic fields can produce spectral
lines with energies of up to about 3 keV, and it may be responsible for
absorption features detected recently in the soft X-ray spectra of several
radio-quiet isolated neutron stars. Quantization of the ion's motion across a
magnetic field results in a fine structure of spectral lines, with a typical
spacing of tens electron-volts in magnetar-scale fields. It also gives rise to
ion cyclotron transitions, whose energies and oscillator strengths depend on
the state of the bound ion.",2005-05-23T00:04:38Z
Low Luminosity Companions to White Dwarfs,"This paper presents results of a near-infrared imaging survey for low mass
stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs. A wide field proper motion
survey of 261 white dwarfs was capable of directly detecting companions at
orbital separations between $\sim100$ and 5000 AU with masses as low as 0.05
$M_{\odot}$, while a deep near field search of 86 white dwarfs was capable of
directly detecting companions at separations between $\sim50$ and 1100 AU with
masses as low as 0.02 $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, all white dwarf targets were
examined for near-infrared excess emission, a technique capable of detecting
companions at arbitrarily close separations down to masses of 0.05 $M_{\odot}$.
  No brown dwarf candidates were detected, which implies a brown dwarf
companion fraction of $<0.5$% for white dwarfs. In contrast, the stellar
companion fraction of white dwarfs as measured by this survey is 22%,
uncorrected for bias. Moreover, most of the known and suspected stellar
companions to white dwarfs are low mass stars whose masses are only slightly
greater than the masses of brown dwarfs. Twenty previously unknown stellar
companions were detected, five of which are confirmed or likely white dwarfs
themselves, while fifteen are confirmed or likely low mass stars.
  Similar to the distribution of cool field dwarfs as a function of spectral
type, the number of cool unevolved dwarf companions peaks at mid-M type. Based
on the present work, relative to this peak, field L dwarfs appear to be roughly
2-3 times more abundant than companion L dwarfs. Additionally, there is no
evidence that the initial companion masses have been altered by post main
sequence binary interactions.",2005-06-01T13:02:54Z
"The binary period and outburst behaviour of the SMC X-ray binary pulsar
  system SXP504","A probable binary period has been detected in the optical counterpart to the

coincident with an Optical Gravitational Lensing (OGLE) object in the
lightcurves of which several optical outburst peaks are visible at ~ 268 day
intervals. Timing analysis shows a period of 268.6 +/- 0.1 days at > 99%
significance. Archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data for the 504s
pulse-period has revealed detections which correspond closely with predicted or
actual peaks in the optical data. The relationship between this orbital period
and the pulse period of 504s is within the normal variance found in the Corbet
diagram.",2005-05-17T17:27:27Z
Binary systems and stellar mergers in massive star formation,"We present a model for the formation of high-mass close binary systems in the
context of forming massive stars through gas accretion in the centres of
stellar clusters. A low-mass wide binary evolves under mass accretion towards a
high-mass close binary, attaining system masses of order 30-50 solar masses at
separations of order 1 AU. The resulting high frequency of binary systems with
two massive components is in agreement with observations. These systems are
typically highly eccentric and may evolve to have periastron separations less
than their stellar radii. Mergers of these binary systems are therefore likely
and can lead to the formation of the most massive stars, circumventing the
problem of radiation pressure stopping the accretion. The stellar density
required to induce binary mergers is one million stars per cubic parsec, or
approximately one percent that required for direct stellar collisions.",2005-06-28T09:49:44Z
"The SAURON project - IV. The mass-to-light ratio, the virial mass
  estimator and the fundamental plane of elliptical and lenticular galaxies","We investigate with unprecedented accuracy the correlations between the
dynamical mass-to-light ratio M/L and other global observables of E and S0
galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild
dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field
stellar kinematics. We find a tight correlation of the form
(M/L)=(3.80+/-0.14)*(sigma/200 km/s)^(0.84+/-0.07) between the dynamical M/L
(in the I-band) and the luminosity-weighted second moment (sigma) of the
line-of-sight velocity-distribution within Re. The observed rms scatter in M/L
for our sample is 18%, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is ~13%. The
(M/L)-sigma relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight
correlations between sigma and other galaxy global observables. The comparison
of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane
(FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the `tilt' of the FP of
early-type galaxies, is due to a real M/L variation, while structural and
orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. The virial mass is a reliable
estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies. The best-fitting
virial relation has the form (M/L)_vir=(5.0+/-0.1)*Re*sigma^2/(L*G). The
comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)_pop inferred from the analysis
of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in
early-type galaxies of ~30% of the total mass inside one Re. (Abridged)",2005-05-03T17:03:25Z
Model Simulations of a Shock-Cloud Interaction in the Cygnus Loop,"We present optical observations and 2D hydrodynamic modeling of an isolated
shocked ISM cloud. H$\alpha$ images taken in 1992.6 and 2003.7 of a small
optical emission cloud along the southwestern limb of the Cygnus Loop were used
to measure positional displacements of $\sim$ $0 \farcs 1$ yr$^{-1}$ for
surrounding Balmer dominated emission filaments and $0\farcs025 - \farcs055$
yr$^{-1}$ for internal cloud emission features. These measurements imply
transverse velocities of $\simeq$ 250 km s$^{-1}$ and $\simeq$ 80 -- 140 km
s$^{-1}$ for ambient ISM and internal cloud shocks respectively. The complex
shock structure visible within the cloud indicates that the cloud's internal
density distribution is two phased: a smoothly varying background density which
is populated by higher density clumps. We present model results for a shock
interacting with a non-uniform ISM cloud. We find that this cloud can be well
modeled by a smoothly varying power law core surrounded by a low density
envelope with a Lorentzian profile. The lack of sharp density gradients in such
a model inhibits the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, consistent with
the cloud's appearance. Our model results also suggest that cloud clumps have
densities $\sim$ 10 times the ambient ISM density and account for $\sim$ 30% of
the total cloud volume. Moreover, the observed spacing of internal cloud shocks
and model simulations indicate that the distance between clumps is $\sim$ 4
clump radii.",2005-07-13T17:44:04Z
Ursa Major: a missing low-mass CDM halo?,"The recently discovered Ursa Major dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy candidate
is about five to eight times less luminous than the faintest previously known
dSphs And IX, Draco, and UMi. In this Letter, we present velocity measurements
of seven color-magnitude selected UMajor candidate stars. Two of them are
apparent non-members based on metallicity and velocity, and the remaining five
stars yield a systemic heliocentric velocity of v=-52.45 +/-4.27 km/s and a
central line of sight velocity dispersion of 9.3 (+11.7 -1.2) km/s, with 95%
confidence that the dispersion is >6.5 km/s. Assuming that UMajor is in
dynamical equilibrium, it is clearly dark matter dominated, and cannot be a
purely stellar system like a globular cluster. It has an inferred central
mass-to-light ratio of M/L~500 and, based on our studies of other dSphs, may
possess a much larger total mass to light ratio. UMajor is unexpectedly massive
for its low luminosity -- indeed, UMajor appears to be the most dark-matter
dominated galaxy yet discovered. The presence of so much dark matter in UMajor
immediately suggests that it may be a member of the missing population of
low-mass galaxies predicted by the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm. Given the
weak correlation between dSph mass and luminosity, it is entirely likely that a
population of dark dwarfs surrounds our Galaxy.",2005-07-07T02:18:29Z
"Constraints on dark matter and the shape of the Milky Way dark halo from
  the 511 keV line","About one year ago, it was speculated that decaying or annihilating Light
Dark Matter (LDM) particles could explain the flux and extension of the 511 keV
line emission in the galactic centre. Here we present a thorough comparison
between theoretical expectations of the galactic positron distribution within
the LDM scenario and observational data from INTEGRAL/SPI. Unlike previous
analyses, there is now enough statistical evidence to put tight constraints on
the shape of the dark matter halo of our galaxy, if the galactic positrons
originate from dark matter. For annihilating candidates, the best fit to the
observed 511 keV emission is provided by a radial density profile with inner
logarithmic slope gamma=1.03+-0.04. In contrast, decaying dark matter requires
a much steeper density profile, gamma>1.5, rather disfavoured by both
observations and numerical simulations. Within the annihilating LDM scenario, a
velocity-independent cross-section would be consistent with the observational
data while a cross-section purely proportional to v^2 can be rejected at a high
confidence level. Assuming the most simplistic model where the galactic
positrons are produced as primaries, we show that the LDM candidate should be a
scalar rather than a spin-1/2 particle and obtain a very stringent constraint
on the value of the positron production cross-section to explain the 511 keV
emission. One consequence is that the value of the fine structure constant
should differ from that recommended in the CODATA. This is a very strong test
for the LDM scenario and an additional motivation in favour of experiments
measuring alpha directly. Our results finally indicate that an accurate
measurement of the shape of the dark halo profile could have a tremendous
impact on the determination of the origin of the 511 keV line and vice versa.",2005-07-06T18:12:58Z
Discovery of a Nearly Edge-On Disk Around HD 32297,"We report the discovery of a nearly edge-on disk about the A0 star HD 32297
seen in light scattered by the disk grains revealed in NICMOS PSF-subtracted
coronagraphic images. The disk extends to a distance of at least 400 AU (3.3"")
along its major axis with a 1.1 micron flux density of 4.81 +/-0.57 mJy beyond
a radius of 0.3"" from the coronagraphically occulted star. The fraction of 1.1
micron starlight scattered by the disk, 0.0033 +/- 0.0004, is comparable to its
fractional excess emission at 25 + 60 micron of ~ 0.0027 as measured from IRAS
data. The disk appears to be inclined 10.5 degrees +/- 2.5 degrees from an
edge-on viewing geometry, with its major axis oriented 236.5 degrees +/- 1
degree eastward of north. The disk exhibits unequal brightness in opposing
sides and a break in the surface brightness profile along NE-side disk major
axis. Such asymmetries might implicate the existence of one or more (unseen)
planetary mass companions.",2005-07-14T17:33:25Z
Discrete Quantum Spectrum of Observable Correlations from Inflation,"The decoherence of quantum fluctuations into classical perturbations during
inflation is discussed. A simple quantum mechanical argument, using a spatial
particle wavefunction rather than a field description, shows that observable
correlations from inflation must have a discrete spectrum, since they originate
and freeze into the metric within a compact region. The number of discrete
modes is estimated using a holographic bound on the number of degrees of
freedom. The discreteness may be detectable in some models; for example, if
there is a fundamental universal frequency spectrum, the inflationary
gravitational wave background may be resolvable into discrete emission lines.",2005-04-16T21:14:39Z
"A Vertical Resonances of G-Mode Oscillations in Warped Disks and QPOs in
  Low-Mass X-Ray Binaries","Resonant oscillations in warped disks are examined in order to explain
high-frequency QPOs and horizontal-branch QPOs in low-mass X-ray binaries.
Different from our previous work, addressed to the same subjects, we relax in
this paper the assumption that the disks are isothermal in the vertical
direction. That is, the pressure, density, and temperature are assumed to be
distributed in the vertical direction with a polytropic relation, and the
polytropic index changes as the disk state changes. By this generalization and
by some subsidiaries we can qualitatively explain, within the framework of our
resonance model, observed large frequency variations in neutron-star QPOs and
little variations in black-hole QPOs. We consider vertical resonances of g-mode
oscillations, since they are most appropriate to explain observations.",2005-07-10T12:05:27Z
"On the Steady Nature of Line-Driven Disk Winds: Application to
  Cataclysmic Variables","We apply the semi-analytical analysis of the steady nature of line-driven
winds presented in two earlier papers to disk winds driven by the flux
distribution of a standard Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) disk for typical
cataclysmic variable (CV) parameters. We find that the wind critical point
tends to be closer to the disk surface towards the inner disk regions. Our main
conclusion, however, is that a line-driven wind, arising from a steady disk
flux distribution of a standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk capable of locally
supplying the corresponding mass flow, is steady. These results confirm the
findings of an earlier paper that studied ""simple"" flux distributions that are
more readily analyzable than those presented here. These results are consistent
with the steady velocity nature of outflows observationally inferred for both
CVs and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). We find good agreement with the 2.5D CV
disk wind models of Pereyra and collaborators. These results suggest that the
likely scenario to account for the wind outflows commonly observed in CVs is
the line-driven accretion disk wind scenario, as suggested early-on by Cordova
& Mason (1982). For QSOs, these results show that the line-driven accretion
disk wind continues to be a promising scenario to account for the outflows
detected in broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs, as suggested early-on by Turnshek
(1984), and analyzed in detail by Murray et al. (1995).",2005-06-01T03:57:50Z
On ion-ion correlation effects during stellar core collapse,"The role of ion-ion correlations in suppressing neutrino-nucleus elastic
scattering during stellar core collapse is reinvestigated, using two different
equations of state. We test the improved description by Itoh et al. against the
treatment suggested by Horowitz and find that the stronger cross section
reduction for small momentum transfer in the former case does not lead to
noticeable changes of the core deleptonization and entropy increase during
collapse, because the improvements are relevant below neutrino trapping
conditions only for very low neutrino energies, corresponding to a very small
phase space volume. Treating screening effects for ionic mixtures by the linear
mixing rule, applied to the collection of representative heavy nucleus, alpha
particles, and free nucleons, which is assumed to characterize the composition
in nuclear statistical equilibrium, we cannot determine mentionable differences
during stellar collapse, because alpha particles are not sufficiently abundant
and their coherent scattering opacity is too small.",2005-04-13T08:45:07Z
"Modeling Accelerated Pick-up Ion Distributions at an Interplanetary
  Shock","The acceleration of interstellar pick-up ions as well as solar wind species
has been observed at a multitude of interplanetary (IP) shocks by different
spacecraft. The efficiency of injection of the pick-up ion component differs
from that of the solar wind, and is expected to be strongly enhanced at highly
oblique and quasi-perpendicular shock events, in accord with inferences from
{\it in situ} observations. This paper explores theoretical modeling of the
phase space distributions of accelerated ions obtained by the Ulysses mission
for the Day 292, 1991 shock associated with a corotating interaction region,
encountered before Ulysses' fly-by of Jupiter. A Monte Carlo simulation is used
to model the acceleration process, adapting a technique that has been
successfully tested on earlier IP shocks possessing minimal pick-up ion
presence. Phase space distributions from the simulation technique for various
low mass ions are compared with SWICS and HI-SCALE data to deduce values of a
``turbulence parameter'' that controls the efficiency of injection, and the
degree of cross-field diffusion. Acceptable fits are obtained for the $H^+$ and
$He^+$ populations using standard prescriptions for the pick-up ion
distribution; $He^{++}$ spectral data was only fit well for scenarios very
close to the Bohm diffusion limit. It is also found that the simulation
successfully accounts for the observation of energetic protons farther upstream
of the forward shock than lower energy pick-up protons, using the same
turbulence parameter that is required to achieve reasonable spectral fits.",2005-05-27T23:36:25Z
Proper Motions of the HH 47 Jet Observed with the Hubble Space Telescope,"We present a proper motion study of the shock waves within the classic
stellar jet HH 47 based on Hubble Space Telescope H-alpha and [S II] images of
the region taken over two epochs. Individual knots within the jet and in the
bow shock/Mach disk working surface of HH 47A move significantly in the five
years that separate the images, and the excellent spatial resolution of HST
makes it possible to measure the proper motions with enough precision to easily
observe differential motions throughout the flow. The bright portion of the jet
emerges at 37.5 +/- 2.5 degrees from the plane of the sky with an average
velocity of 300 km/s. Dynamical ages of the shock waves in the jet range from a
few decades for knots recently ejected by the source to ~ 1300 years for the
faint extended bow shock HH 47D. The jet curves, but motions of knots in the
jet are directed radially away from the exciting source, and velocity
variability in the flow drives the shock waves that heat the jet internally.
The jet orientation angle varies with time by about 15 degrees, and currently
points to the northwestern portion of a cavity outlined by a reflection nebula,
where a quasi-stationary shock deflects the jet. The major working surface HH
47A is more complex than a simple bow shock/Mach disk, and contains numerous
clumps that move relative to one another with velocities of ~ +/- 40 km/s.
Small clumps or instabilities affect the Mach disk, and dense clumps may move
all the way through the working surface to cause the bumpy morphology seen at
the bow shock. A localized area between the bow shock and Mach disk varies
significantly between the two sets of images.",2005-07-22T00:23:17Z
"The Evolution of Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers: Metallicities and Star
  Formation Rates","The damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA quasar absorption lines provide
powerful probes of the evolution of metals, gas, and stars in galaxies. One
major obstacle in trying to understand the evolution of DLAs and sub-DLAs has
been the small number of metallicity measurements at z < 1.5, an epoch spanning
\~70 % of the cosmic history. In recent surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope
and Multiple Mirror Telescope, we have doubled the DLA Zn sample at z < 1.5.
Combining our results with those at higher redshifts from the literature, we
find that the global mean metallicity of DLAs does not rise to the solar value
at low redshifts. These surprising results appear to contradict the near-solar
mean metallicity observed for nearby (z ~ 0) galaxies and the predictions of
cosmic chemical evolution models based on the global star formation history.
Finally, we discuss direct constraints on the star formation rates (SFRs) in
the absorber galaxies from our deep Fabry-Perot Ly-alpha imaging study and
other emission-line studies in the literature. A large fraction of the observed
heavy-element quasar absorbers at 0 < z < 3.4 appear to have SFRs substantially
below the global mean SFR, consistent with the low metallicities observed in
the spectroscopic studies.",2005-04-26T05:46:47Z
"Reconstruction of showers in the calorimeter during the first flight of
  the CREAM balloon experiment","The Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass (CREAM) balloon-borne experiment was first
flown from Antarctica in December 2004. The instrument includes a
tungsten/Sci-Fi calorimeter preceded by a graphite target (~0.5 interaction
length and ~1 radiation length) where a hadronic shower is initiated by the
inelastic interaction of the incoming nucleus. The fine granularity (1 cm) of
the 20 radiation length calorimeter allows the imaging of the narrow
electromagnetic core of the shower and the determination of the direction of
the incident particle. Preliminary results, from the flight data, on the shower
reconstruction capability of the instrument and on the observed shower
properties are presented.",2005-07-21T15:18:21Z
"The kinetic temperature of a molecular cloud at redshift 0.7: Ammonia in
  the gravitational lens B0218+357","Using the Effelsberg 100-m telescope, absorption in the (J,K) = (1,1), (2,2)
and (3,3) inversion lines of ammonia (NH_3) was detected at a redshift of z =
0.6847 toward the gravitational lens system B0218+357. The lambda ~ 2cm
absorption peaks at 0.5-1.0 % of the continuum level and appears to cover a
smaller fraction of the radio continuum background than lines at millimeter
wavelengths. Measured intensities are consistent with a rotation temperature of
~35K, corresponding to a kinetic temperature of ~55K. The column density toward
the core of image A then becomes N(NH_3) ~ 1 * 10^(14)cm^(-2) and fractional
abundance and gas density are of order X(NH_3)~10^(-8) and n(H_2)~5 *
10^(3)cm^(-3), respectively. Upper limits are reported for the (2,1) and (4,4)
lines of NH_3 and for transitions of the SO, DCN, OCS, SiO, C_3N, H_2CO, SiC_2,
HC_3N, HC_5N, and CH_3OH molecules. These limits and the kinetic temperature
indicate that the absorption lines are not arising from a cold dark cloud but
from a warm, diffuse, predominantly molecular medium. The physical parameters
of the absorbing molecular complex, seen at a projected distance of ~2 kpc to
the center of the lensing galaxy, are quite peculiar when compared with the
properties of clouds in the Galaxy or in nearby extragalactic systems.",2005-08-09T14:08:43Z
Cosmic ray threshold in an asymptotically dS spacetime,"We discuss the threshold anomaly in ultra-high energy cosmic ray physics by
assuming that the matter world just be perturbation of a de Sitter universe,
which is consistent with the recent astronomical observations: about two thirds
of the whole energy in the universe is contributed by a small positive
cosmological constant. One-particle states are presented explicitly. It is
noticed that the dispersion relation of free particles is dependent on the
degrees of freedom of angular momentum. This fact can be regarded as the
effects of the cosmological constant on kinematics of particles.",2005-05-31T08:46:57Z
"Identification of the optical counterparts of high-mass X-ray binaries
  through optical photometry and spectroscopy","We present the results of our search for optical counterparts to high-mass
X-ray transient sources discovered by various X-ray missions. We obtained CCD
images of the X-ray fields through BVR and Halpha filters in order to identify
early-type stars in the R-Halpha versus B-V colour-colour diagram. We also
obtained medium-resolution spectroscopy of the candidates in order to confirm
the presence of H\alpha emission and perform spectral classification. We report
on the discovery of the optical counterparts to two X-ray sources: XTE
J1858+034 and IGR J01363+6610, and the follow-up observations of another two,
newly identified by our group: SAX J2103.5+4545 and GRO J2058+42. For another
source, IGR J00370+6122, we present the first detailed optical spectral
analysis. The optical photometry and spectroscopy reveal B-type companions in
all five sources; GRO J2058+42, SAX J2103.5+4545 and IGR J01363+6610 are
positively identified with Be/X-ray binaries, IGR J00370+6122 with a supergiant
X-ray binary, while the nature of XTE J1858+034 is uncertain. We also study the
relationship between the optical and X-ray emission during quiescent states.",2005-05-16T12:09:23Z
"Pushing the Limits of Ground-Based Photometric Precision --
  Sub-Millimagnitude Time-Series Photometry of the Open Cluster NGC 6791","We present the results from a three night, time-series study of the open
cluster NGC 6791 using the Megacam wide-field mosaic CCD camera on the 6.5m MMT
telescope. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the ability to obtain very
high precision photometry for a large number of stars. We achieved better than
1% precision for more than 8000 stars with 14.3 < R < 20.1 and
sub-millimagnitude (as low as 0.36 mmag) precision for over 300 stars with 14.6
< R < 16.3 in the field of this cluster. We also discovered 8 new variable
stars, including a possible delta-Scuti variable with an amplitude of 2%, 6
likely W UMa contact binaries, and a possible RS CVn star, and we identified 5
suspected low-amplitude variables, including one star with an amplitude of 3
mmag. We comment on the implications of this study for a ground-based survey
for transiting planets as small as Neptune.",2005-04-21T21:10:16Z
Silicon Tetrafluoride on Io,"Silicon tetrafluoride (SiF4) is observed in terrestrial volcanic gases and is
predicted to be the major F - bearing species in low temperature volcanic gases
on Io (Schaefer and Fegley, 2005b). SiF4 gas is also a potential indicator of
silica-rich crust on Io. We used F/S ratios in terrestrial and extraterrestrial
basalts, and gas/lava enrichment factors for F and S measured at terrestrial
volcanoes to calculate equilibrium SiF4/SO2 ratios in volcanic gases on Io. We
conclude that SiF4 can be produced at levels comparable to the observed
NaCl/SO2 gas ratio. We also considered potential loss processes for SiF4 in
volcanic plumes and in Io's atmosphere including ion-molecule reactions,
electron chemistry, photochemistry, reactions with the major atmospheric
constituents, and condensation. Photochemical destruction (tchem ~ 266 days)
and/or condensation as Na2SiF6 (s) appear to be the major sinks for SiF4. We
recommend searching for SiF4 with infrared spectroscopy using its 9.7 micron
band as done on Earth.",2005-06-01T20:21:32Z
"Seismic diagnostics of mixing beyond the convective core in intermediate
  mass main-sequence stars","We study prospects for seismic sounding the layer of a partial mixing above
the convective core in main-sequence stars with masses in the 1.2 -- 1.9 solar
mass range. There is an initial tendency to an increase of convective core mass
in such stars and this leads to ambiguities in modeling. Solar-like
oscillations are expected to be excited in such objects. Frequencies of such
oscillations provide diagnostics, which are sensitive to the structure of the
innermost part of the star and they are known as the small separations. We
construct evolutionary models of stars in this mass range assuming various
scenarios for element mixing, which includes formation of element abundance
jumps, as well as semiconvective and overshooting layers. We find that the
three point small separations employing frequencies of radial and dipole modes
provide the best probe of the element distribution above the convective core.
With expected accuracy of frequency measurement from the space experiments, a
discrimination between various scenarios should be possible.",2005-05-25T22:33:22Z
Aligning spinning black holes and accretion discs,"We consider the alignment torque between a spinning black hole and an
accretion disc whose angular momenta are misaligned. This situation must hold
initially in almost all gas accretion events on to supermassive black holes,
and may occur in binaries where the black hole receives a natal supernova kick.
We show that the torque always acts to align the hole's spin with the total
angular momentum without changing its magnitude. The torque acts dissipatively
on the disc, reducing its angular momentum, and aligning it with the hole if
and only if the angle theta between the angular momenta J_d of the disc and J_h
of the hole satisfies the inequality cos theta > -J_d / 2 J_h. If this
condition fails, which requires both theta > pi/2 and J_d < 2 J_h, the disc
counteraligns.",2005-07-05T14:57:03Z
Inhomogeneous systematic signals in cosmic shear observations,"We calculate the systematic errors in the weak gravitational lensing power
spectrum which would be caused by spatially varying calibration (i.e.
multiplicative) errors, such as might arise from uncorrected seeing or
extinction variations. The systematic error is fully described by the angular
two-point correlation function of the systematic in the case of the 2D lensing
that we consider here. We investigate three specific cases: Gaussian,
``patchy'' and exponential correlation functions. In order to keep systematic
errors below statistical errors in future LSST-like surveys, the spatial
variation of calibration should not exceed 3% rms. This conclusion is
independently true for all forms of correlation function we consider. The
relative size the E- and B-mode power spectrum errors does, however, depend
upon the form of the correlation function, indicating that one cannot repair
the E-mode power spectrum systematics by means of the B-mode measurements.",2005-07-22T19:48:33Z
The role of black hole mass in quasar radio activity,"We use a homogeneous sample of about 300, 0.3 <~ z <~ 3, radio-loud quasars
drawn from the FIRST and 2dF QSO surveys to investigate a possible dependence
of radio activity on black-hole mass. By analyzing composite spectra for the
populations of radio-quiet and radio-loud QSOs -- chosen to have the same
redshift and luminosity distribution -- we find with high statistical
significance that radio-loud quasars are on average associated with black holes
of masses ~10^{8.6} M_sun, about twice as large as those measured for
radio-quiet quasars (~10^{8.3} M_sun). We also find a clear dependence of black
hole mass on optical luminosity of the form log (M_BH/M_sun)_{RL}= 8.57(\pm
0.06) - 0.27(\pm 0.06) (M_B + 24.5) and log (M_BH/M_sun)_{RQ}= 8.43(\pm 0.05)
-0.32(\pm 0.06) (M_B + 24.5), respectively for the case of radio-loud and
radio-quiet quasars. It is intriguing to note that these two trends run roughly
parallel to each other, implying that radio-loud quasars are associated to
black holes more massive than those producing the radio-quiet case at all
sampled luminosities. On the other hand, in the case of radio-loud quasars, we
find evidence for only a weak (if any) dependence of the black hole mass on
radio power. The above findings seem to support the belief that there exists --
at a given optical luminosity -- a threshold black hole mass associated with
the onset of significant radio activity such as that of radio-loud QSOs;
however, once the activity is triggered, there appears to be very little
connection between black hole mass and level of radio output.",2005-05-10T14:54:57Z
"NOAO Fundamental Plane Survey -- II. Age and Metallicity along the Red
  Sequence","We present spectroscopic linestrength data for 4097 red-sequence galaxies in
93 low-redshift galaxy clusters, and use these to investigate variations in
average stellar populations as a function of galaxy mass. Our analysis includes
an improved treatment of nebular emission contamination, which affects ~10% of
the sample galaxies. Using the stellar population models of D. Thomas and
collaborators, we simultaneously fit twelve observed linestrength-sigma
relations in terms of common underlying trends of age, [Z/H] (total
metallicity) and a/Fe (alpha-element enhancement). We find that the observed
linestrength-sigma relations can be explained only if higher-mass red-sequence
galaxies are, on average, older, more metal rich, and more alpha-enhanced than
lower-mass galaxies. Quantitatively, the scaling relations are
age=sigma^(0.59+/-0.13), Z/H=sigma^(0.53+/-0.08) and a/Fe=sigma^(0.31+/-0.06),
where the errors reflect the range obtained using different subsets of indices.
We conclude that although the stars in giant red galaxies in clusters formed
early, most of the galaxies at the faint end joined the red sequence only at
recent epochs. This ""down-sizing"" trend is in good qualitative agreement with
observations of the red sequence at higher redshifts, but is not predicted by
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.",2005-05-13T20:26:53Z
Pioneer Anomaly and the Kuiper Belt mass distribution,"Pioneer 10 and 11 were the first probes sent to study the outer planets of
the Solar System and Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to leave the Solar
System. Besides their already epic journeys, Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft were
subjected to an unaccounted effect interpreted as a constant acceleration
toward the Sun, the so-called Pioneer anomaly. One of the possibilities put
forward for explaining the Pioneer anomaly is the gravitational acceleration of
the Kuiper Belt. In this work we examine this hypothesis for various models for
the Kuiper Belt mass distribution. We find that the gravitational effect due to
the Kuiper Belt cannot account for the Pioneer anomaly. Furthermore, we have
also studied the hypothesis that drag forces can explain the the Pioneer
anomaly; however we conclude that the density required for producing the
Pioneer anomaly is many orders of magnitude greater than those of
interplanetary and interstellar dust. Our conclusions suggest that only through
a mission, the Pioneer anomaly can be confirmed and further investigated. If a
mission with these aims is ever sent to space, it turns out, on account of our
results, that it will be also a quite interesting probe to study the mass
distribution of the Kuiper Belt.",2005-06-15T01:26:11Z
Modified Newtonian Dynamics In Dimensionless Form,"Modified Newtonian dynamics proposed that gravitational field needs
modifications when the field strength $g$ is weaker than a critical value
$g_0$. This has been shown to be a good candidate as an alternative to cosmic
dark matter. There is another way to look at this theory as a length scale
dependent theory. One will show that modification of the Newtonian field
strength depends on the mass distribution and the coordinate scale of the
system. It is useful to separate the effective gravitation field $g(r)$ into a
small scale (or short-distance)$g_s$ field and a large scale (or a
long-distance) $g_l$ field that should be helpful for a better understanding of
the underlying physics. The effective potential is also derived.",2005-04-01T15:27:14Z
Cosmological black holes as voids progenitors. I. Simulations,"Cosmological black holes (CBH), i.e. black holes with masses larger than
$10^{14} solar masses, have been proposed as possible progenitors of galaxy
voids (Stornaiolo 2002). The presence of a CBH in the central regions of a void
should induce significant gravitational lensing effects and in this paper we
discuss such gravitational signatures using simulated data. These signatures
may be summarized as follows: i) a blind spot in the projected position of the
CBH where no objects can be detected; ii) an excess of faint secondary images;
iii) an excess of double images having a characteristic angular separation. All
these signatures are shown to be detectable in future deep surveys.",2005-07-19T11:58:05Z
Spectral Monitoring of Mrk 421 during 2004,"Daily monitoring of Mrk 421 in the X-ray and TeV bands during the first half
of 2004 showed rapid flaring events above an elevated base flux level,
culminating from March to May 2004 at an average flux level matching the
highest detected flux state in 2001. Here we summarise the daily X-ray spectral
variability observed with the RXTE-PCA instrument. We also explore the X-ray
and TeV gamma-ray connection from near simultaneous data obtained using the
Whipple 10m Cherenkov imaging telescope.",2005-07-19T18:27:25Z
"Spectral Evolution of a Luminous Compact X-Ray Source in NGC 253 with
  Chandra and XMM-Newton","Spectral studies of a luminous X-ray source, NGC 253 X21, are presented based
on archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data. The Chandra observation on 1999
December 16 detected the source at a bolometric luminosity of 0.3 x 10^39 erg/s
(assuming isotropic emission), while an XMM-Newton observation on 2000 June 3
revealed a short-term source variation in the range of (0.6--1.3) x 10^39
erg/s. All spectra from these observations were successfully modeled by
emission from an optically thick accretion disk. The average inner disk radius
was kept constant at 63 x (cos 60/cos i)^(1/2) km, where i is the disk
inclination, and did not vary significantly, while the disk inner temperature
changed in the range of 0.9--1.4 keV. Assuming that this object is an accreting
Schwarzschild black hole, and that the disk inner radius coincides with its
last stable orbit, the mass of the black hole is estimated to be ~ 7 M_sun. The
disk luminosity corresponds to (30--120) x (cos 60/cos i) % of the Eddington
limit of this black hole. Therefore, this luminous X-ray source, NGC 253 X21,
is understood consistently to be an accreting stellar mass black hole in the
standard disk state.",2005-06-27T08:11:27Z
Lithopanspermia in Star Forming Clusters,"This paper considers the lithopanspermia hypothesis in star forming groups
and clusters, where the chances of biological material spreading from one solar
system to another is greatly enhanced (relative to the field) due to the close
proximity of the systems and lower relative velocities. These effects more than
compensate for the reduced time spent in such crowded environments. This paper
uses 300,000 Monte Carlo scattering calculations to determine the cross
sections for rocks to be captured by binaries and provides fitting formulae for
other applications. We assess the odds of transfer as a function of the
ejection speed and number of members in the birth aggregate. The odds of any
given ejected meteroid being recaptured by another solar system are relatively
low. Because the number of ejected rocks per system can be large, virtually all
solar systems are likely to share rocky ejecta with all of the other solar
systems in their birth cluster. The number of ejected rocks that carry living
microorganisms is much smaller and less certain, but we estimate that several
million rocks can be ejected from a biologically active solar system. For
typical birth environments, the capture of life bearing rocks is expected to
occur 10 -- 16,000 times per cluster (under favorable conditions), depending on
the ejection speeds. Only a small fraction of the captured rocks impact the
surfaces of terrestrial planets, so that only a few lithopanspermia events are
expected (per cluster).",2005-04-29T13:07:16Z
"KASCADE measurements of energy spectra for elemental groups of cosmic

unfolding the two-dimensional frequency spectrum of electron and muon numbers.
Aim of the analysis is the determination of energy spectra for elemental groups
representing the chemical composition of primary cosmic rays. Since such an
analysis depends crucially on simulations of air showers the two different
hadronic interaction models QGSJet and SIBYLL are used for their generation.
The resulting primary energy spectra show that the knee in the all particle
spectrum is due to a steepening of the spectra of light elements but, also,
that neither of the two simulation sets is able to describe the measured data
consistently over the whole energy range with discrepancies appearing in
different energy regions.",2005-05-19T16:28:45Z
Orbital X-Ray Variability of the Microquasar LS 5039,"The properties of the orbit and the donor star in the high mass X-ray binary
microquasar LS 5039 indicate that accretion processes should mainly occur via a
radiatively driven wind. In such a scenario, significant X-ray variability
would be expected due to the eccentricity of the orbit. The source has been
observed at X-rays by several missions, although with a poor coverage that
prevents to reach any conclusion about orbital variability. Therefore, we
conducted RossiXTE observations of the microquasar system LS 5039 covering a
full orbital period of 4 days. Individual observations are well fitted with an
absorbed power-law plus a Gaussian at 6.7 keV, to account for iron line
emission that is probably a diffuse background feature. In addition, we have
taken into account that the continuum is also affected by significant diffuse
background contamination. Our results show moderate power-law flux variations
on timescales of days, as well as the presence of miniflares on shorter
timescales. The new orbital ephemeris of the system recently obtained by
Casares et al. have allowed us to show, for the first time, that an increase of
emission is seen close to the periastron passage, as expected in an accretion
scenario. Moreover, the detected orbital variability is a factor of ~4 smaller
than the one expected by using a simple wind accretion model, and we suggest
that an accretion disk around the compact object could be responsible for this
discrepancy. On the other hand, significant changes in the photon index are
also observed clearly anti-correlated with the flux variations. We interpret
the overall X-ray spectral characteristics of LS 5039 in the context of X-ray
radiation produced by inverse Compton and/or synchrotron processes in the jet
of this microquasar.",2005-07-18T14:56:23Z
"The K20 survey. VII. The spectroscopic catalogue: spectral properties
  and evolution of the galaxy population","The K20 survey is a near infrared-selected, deep (Ks < 20) redshift survey
targeting galaxies in two independent regions of the sky, the CDFS and the
q0055-2659 field. The total Ks-selected sample includes 545 objects. Optical
spectra for 525 of them have been obtained, providing 501 spectroscopic
identifications (including 12 type-1 AGN and 45 stars). This paper describes
the final K20 spectroscopic catalogue, along with the technique used to
determine redshifts, measure the spectral features and characterize the
spectra. The classification of the galaxy spectra has been performed according
to a simple parametric recipe that uses the equivalent widths of the two main
emission lines (O[II] and Halpha+[N II]) and two continuum indices (the 4000A
break index, and a near-UV color index, C(28-39)). We defined three main
spectroscopic classes: red early-type galaxies, blue emission-line galaxies and
the intermediate galaxies, which show emission lines but a red continuum. More
than 95% of the examined galaxies is included in one of these spectral types
and a composite spectrum is built for each of the three galaxy classes. The
blue emission-line and the early-type galaxies have been divided in redshift
bins, and the corresponding composite spectra have been built, in order to
investigate the evolution of the spectral properties of the K20 galaxies with
redshift.",2005-04-11T16:35:48Z

Jets Driven by Accretion Onto Spinning Black Holes,"We present a theoretical model for driving jets by accretion onto Kerr black

Cosmic Rays from Gamma Ray Bursts in the Galaxy,"The rate of terrestrial irradiation events by galactic gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) is estimated using recent standard-energy results. We assume that GRBs
accelerate high-energy cosmic rays, and present results of three-dimensional
simulations of cosmic rays moving in the Galactic magnetic field and diffusing
through pitch-angle scattering. An on-axis GRB extinction event begins with a
powerful prompt gamma-ray and neutron pulse, followed by a longer-lived phase
from cosmic-ray protons and neutron-decay protons that diffuse towards Earth.
Our results force a reinterpretation of reported ~ 10^{18} eV cosmic-ray
anisotropies and offer a rigorous test of the model where high-energy cosmic
rays originate from GRBs, which will soon be tested with the Auger Observatory.",2005-04-06T18:53:22Z
"AGN heating, thermal conduction and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in galaxy
  groups and clusters","(abridged) We investigate in detail the role of active galactic nuclei on the
physical state of the gas in galaxy groups and clusters, and the implications
for anisotropy in the CMB from Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. We include the effect
of thermal conduction, and find that the resulting profiles of temperature and
entropy are consistent with observations. Unlike previously proposed models,
our model predicts that isentropic cores are not an inevitable consequence of
preheating. The model also reproduces the observational trend for the density
profiles to flatten in lower mass systems. We deduce the energy E_agn required
to explain the entropy observations as a function of mass of groups and
clusters M_cl and show that E_agn is proportional to M_cl^alpha with alpha~1.5.
We demonstrate that the entropy measurements, in conjunction with our model,
can be translated into constraints on the cluster--black hole mass relation.
The inferred relation is nonlinear and has the form M_bh\propto M_cl^alpha.
This scaling is an analog and extension of a similar relation between the black
hole mass and the galactic halo mass that holds on smaller scales. We show that
the central decrement of the CMB temperature is reduced due to the enhanced
entropy of the ICM, and that the decrement predicted from the plausible range
of energy input from the AGN is consistent with available data of SZ decrement.
We show that AGN heating, combined with the observational constraints on
entropy, leads to suppression of higher multipole moments in the angular power
spectrum and we find that this effect is stronger than previously thought.",2005-08-04T02:04:18Z
"Age spreads in star forming regions: The lithium test in the Orion
  Nebula Cluster","We present the initial results of a study of the surface lithium abundance in
a sample of low-mass members (M~0.4-1.0 Msun) of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC)
that provide an independent clock to estimate stellar ages. We report discovery
of significant depletion of lithium in four stars with estimated mass of ~0.4
Msun and age ~10Myr. Comparison with the predictions of numerical and
analytical models shows excellent agreement between the isochronal age and
lithium depletion time scale for two objects, the first case in lithium-poor
pre-main sequence stars. Our results bear on the issue of the real age spread
in the ONC and hence on the overall duration of the star formation process,
indicating that the stellar population did not came into existence in a single,
rapid burst.",2005-05-09T08:39:34Z
"Cluster Baryon Fraction and Structure from the Convergence/SZ Effect
  Diagram","The cross-correlation of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) and weak-lensing
imaging surveys can be used to test how well hot baryons trace dark matter in
clusters of galaxies. We examine this concept using mock SZ and weak-lensing
surveys based on the forthcoming AMiBA experiment and generated from a
pre-heated cosmological N-body/hydrodynamic simulation. A cross-correlation
diagram between matched lensing convergence and Compton y maps exhibits
butterfly-wing-like structures, corresponding to individual clusters, that
encode rich information about the distributions of hot gas and dark matter.
When the cluster redshift and temperature are available the slope of a wing
reveals the cluster gas fraction and the width of the wing indicates how badly
the hot gas traces dark matter. On the basis of simulated data we discuss
systematic errors in the projected gas fraction estimates that would be
obtained from such survey comparisons.",2005-06-02T20:01:24Z
"On the effect of the inhomogeneous subsurface flows on the high degree
  solar p-modes","The observed power spectrum of high-degree solar p-modes (l>200) shows
discrepancies with the power spectrum predicted by the stochastic excitement
and damping theory. In an attempt to explain these discrepancies, the present
paper is concerned with the influence of the observed subsurface flows on the
trapped acoustic modes (p-modes). The effect of these inhomogeneous background
flows is investigated by means of a non-modal analysis and a multi-layer model.
It is shown that the rotational and meridional components of the velocity field
change the wavelengths of the oscillation modes which, in turn, results in
modifications of the corresponding modal frequencies. The magnitudes of the
frequency residuals depend on the spatial scales of the modes and on the
gradients of the different components of the flow velocity. Together with other
mechanisms (e.g. the scattering of modes by the large scale convection
(Goldreich & Murray 1994), the non-modal effect of the variation of the
frequencies in time may contribute: 1) to the observed widening of the
corresponding peaks in the observed power spectrum with increasing angular
degree; 2) to the partial dissipation of spectral power, and, as a result, 3)
to the discrepancies between the predicted and the observed power spectrum of
solar p-modes.",2005-04-14T04:21:04Z
"The host galaxies of radio-loud AGN: mass dependencies, gas cooling and
  AGN feedback","The properties of the host galaxies of a well-defined sample of 2215
radio-loud AGN with redshifts 0.03 < z < 0.3, defined from the SDSS, are
investigated. These are predominantly low radio luminosity sources, with 1.4GHz
luminosities of 10^23 to 10^25 W/Hz. The fraction of galaxies that host
radio-loud AGN with L(1.4GHz) > 10^23 W/Hz is a strong function of stellar
mass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 10^10 Msun to more than
30% at 5x10^11 Msun. The integral radio luminosity function is derived in six
ranges of stellar and black hole mass. Its shape is very similar in all of
these ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power-law. Its normalisation
varies strongly with mass, as M_*^2.5 or M_BH^1.6; this scaling only begins to
break down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30%. There is no
correlation between radio and emission line luminosities for the radio-loud AGN
in the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio-loud is
independent of whether it is optically classified as an AGN. The host galaxies
of the radio-loud AGN have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies of
the same mass.
  All of these findings support the conclusion that the optical AGN and low
radio luminosity AGN phenomena are independent and are triggered by different
physical mechanisms. Intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of the
radio-loud AGN fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from the
hot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. It is speculated that gas cooling
provides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud AGN activity,
and it is argued that AGN heating could plausibly balance the cooling of the
gas over time. [Abridged]",2005-06-13T15:23:24Z
Molecular Hydrogen Emission from Protoplanetary Disks,"We have modeled self-consistently the density and temperature profiles of gas
and dust in protoplanetary disks, taking into account irradiation from a
central star. Making use of this physical structure, we have calculated the
level populations of molecular hydrogen and the line emission from the disks.
As a result, we can reproduce the observed strong line spectra of molecular
hydrogen from protoplanetary disks, both in the ultraviolet (UV) and the
near-infrared, but only if the central star has a strong UV excess radiation.",2005-05-06T13:06:36Z
"Deep Photometry of the Globular Cluster M5: Distance Estimates from
  White Dwarf and Main Sequence Stars","We present deep VI photometry of stars in the globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904)
based on images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting
color-magnitude diagram reaches below V ~ 27 mag, revealing the upper 2-3
magnitudes of the white dwarf cooling sequence, and main sequence stars eight
magnitudes and more below the turn-off. We fit the main sequence to subdwarfs
of known parallax to obtain a true distance modulus of (m-M)_0 = 14.45 +/- 0.11
mag. A second distance estimate based on fitting the cluster white dwarf
sequence to field white dwarfs with known parallax yielded (m-M)_0 = 14.67 +/-
0.18 mag. We couple our distance estimates with extensive photometry of the
cluster's RR Lyrae variables to provide a calibration of the RR Lyrae absolute
magnitude yielding M_V(RR) = 0.42 +/- 0.10 mag at [Fe/H] = -1.11 dex. We
provide another luminosity calibration in the form of reddening-free Wasenheit
functions. Comparison of our calibrations with predictions based on recent
models combining stellar evolution and pulsation theories shows encouraging
agreement. (Abridged)",2005-06-29T15:42:19Z
"The Relationship Between Stellar and Black-Hole Mass in Submillimeter
  Galaxies","We analyze deep X-ray, optical and mid-infrared Spitzer observations of the
CDF-N/GOODS-N region to study 13 submillimeter-detected galaxies (SMGs) with
spectroscopic redshifts (median z=2.2). We find a correlation between the
estimated stellar and X-ray luminosity, implying that masses of the black holes
may be related to the stellar masses of their host galaxies. Although the
submillimeter emission implies that these galaxies are undergoing an epoch of
intense star-formation, the Spitzer data reveal a massive stellar population
already in place. These stellar masses are then compared to previously
published black hole mass estimates derived from the X-ray luminosities under
the assumption of Eddington-limit accretion. We find that the black hole masses
for our high-redshift sample are approximately 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller
than galaxies of comparable stellar mass in the local Universe. Although our
estimates of black hole masses will increase if the accretion is sub-Eddington,
and our stellar masses will decrease if we assume a much younger stellar
population or a different initial mass function, we find that only through a
combination of effects is it possible to shift the high redshift galaxies such
that they lie on the local relation. This suggests that the black holes need to
grow substantially between z=2.2 and the present-day, with much of the black
hole growth occurring after the current obscured, far-infrared luminous phase
of activity which is likely associated with the formation of the spheroid. This
interpretation supports a scenario where SMGs pass through a subsequent
accretion-dominated phase, where they would appear as optically bright quasars.

Modelling the chromosphere and transition region of Epsilon Eri (K2 V),"Measurements of ultraviolet line fluxes from Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph and Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer spectra of the K2-dwarf
Epsilon Eri are reported. These are used to develop new emission measure
distributions and semi-empirical atmospheric models for the chromosphere and
lower transition region of the star. These models are the most detailed
constructed to date for a main-sequence star other than the Sun. New ionisation
balance calculations, which account for the effect of finite density on
dielectronic recombination rates, are presented for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen
and silicon. The results of these calculations are significantly different from
the standard Arnaud & Rothenflug ion balance, particularly for alkali-like
ions. The new atmospheric models are used to place constraints on possible
First Ionisation Potential (FIP) related abundance variations in the lower
atmosphere and to discuss limitations of single-component models for the
interpretation of certain optically thick line fluxes.",2005-06-02T15:32:03Z
"X-ray Cluster Associated with the z=1.063 CSS Quasar 3C 186: The Jet is
  NOT Frustrated","We report the Chandra discovery of an X-ray cluster at redshift z = 1.063
associated with the Compact Steep Spectrum radio loud quasar 3C 186
(Q0740+380). Diffuse X-ray emission is detected out to ~120 kpc from the quasar
and contains 741+/-40 net counts. The X-ray spectrum of the extended emission
shows strong Fe-line emission (EW=412eV) at the quasar redshift and confirms
the thermal nature of this diffuse component. We measure a cluster temperature
of 5.2(+1.2/-0.9) keV and an X-ray luminosity L(0.5-2 keV) ~ 6e44 erg/sec,
which are in agreement with the luminosity-temperature relation for
high-redshift clusters. This is the first detection of a bright X-ray cluster
around a luminous (L_bol ~1e47 erg/sec) CSS quasar at high redshift and only
the fifth z>1 X-ray cluster detected. We find that the CSS radio source is
highly overpressured with respect to the thermal cluster medium by about 3
orders of magnitude. This provides direct observational evidence that the radio
source is not thermally confined as posited in the ``frustrated'' scenario for
CSS sources. Instead, it appears that the radio source may be young and we are
observing it at an early stage of its evolution. In that case the radio source
could supply the energy into the cluster and potentially prevent its cooling.",2005-06-16T19:08:44Z
"Constraining beta(z) and Omega_m from redshift-space distortions in z~3
  galaxy surveys","We use sample of 813 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) with 2.6<z<3.4 to perform a
detailed analysis of the redshift-space (z-space) distortions in their
clustering pattern and from them derive confidence levels in the
[Omega_m,beta(z=3)] plane. We model the z-space distortions in the shape of the
correlation function measured in orthogonal directions, xi(sigma,pi). This
modeling requires an accurate description of the real-space correlation
function to be given as an input. From the projection of xi(sigma,pi) in the
angular direction, w_p(sigma), we derive the best fitting amplitude and slope
for the LBG real-space correlation function: r_0=4.48(+0.17)(-0.18) h(-1) Mpc
and gamma=1.76(+0.08)(-0.09) (xi(r)= (r/r_0)^-gamma). A comparison between the
shape of xi(s) and w_p(sigma) suggests that xi(r) deviates from a simple
power-law model, with a break at ~9 h(-1) Mpc. This model is consistent with
the observed projected correlation function. However, due to the limited size
of the fields used, the w_p(sigma) results are limited to sigma < 10 h(-1) Mpc.
Assuming this double power-law model, and by analysing the shape distortions in
xi(sigma,pi), we find the following constraints: beta(z=3) = 0.15
(+0.20)(-0.15), Omega_m = 0.35 (+0.65)(-0.22). Combining these results with
orthogonal constraints from linear evolution of density perturbations, we find
that beta(z=3) = 0.25 (+0.05)(-0.06), Omega_m = 0.55 (+0.45)(-0.16).",2005-05-23T09:07:08Z
The XMM-Newton Slew Survey,"XMM-Newton, with the huge collecting area of its mirrors and the high quantum
efficiency of its EPIC detectors, is the most sensitive X-ray observatory ever
flown. This is strikingly evident during slew exposures, which, while yielding
only at most 14 seconds of on-source exposure time, actually constitute a 2-10
keV survey ten times deeper than all other ""all-sky"" surveys. The current
(April 2005) XMM archive contains 374 slew exposures which give a uniform
coverage over around 10,000 square degrees (approx. 25% of the sky). Here we
describe the results of pilot studies, the current status of the XMM-Newton

Long-term Phase-coherent X-ray Timing of PSR B0540-69,"We present a new phase-coherent timing analysis for the young, energetic
pulsar PSR B0540-69 using 7.6 yr of data from the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer.
We measure the braking index, n=2.140+/-0.009, and discuss our measurement in
the context of other discordant values reported in the literature. We present
an improved source position from the phase-coherent timing of the pulsar, to
our knowledge, the first of its kind from X-ray pulsar timing. In addition, we
detect evidence for a glitch which has been previously reported but later
disputed. The glitch occured at MJD 51335+/-12 with a fractional change in
frequency of (1.4+/-0.2)E{-9} and a fractional change in frequency derivative
of (1.33+/-0.02)E{-4}. We calculate that the glitch activity parameter for PSR
B0540-69 is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the Crab pulsar which
has otherwise very similar properties. This suggests that neutron stars of
similar apparent ages, rotation properties and inferred dipolar B fields can
have significantly different internal properties.",2005-07-25T15:25:25Z
A Parameter-free Statistical Measurement of Halos with Power Spectra,"We show that, in the halo model of large-scale structure formation, the
difference between the Fourier and the DWT (discrete wavelet transform) power
spectra provides a statistical measurement of the halos. This statistical
quantity is free from parameters related to the shape of the mass profile and
the identification scheme of halos. That is, the statistical measurement is
invariant in the sense that models with reasonably defined and selected
parameters of the halo models should yield the same difference of the Fourier
and DWT spectra. This feature is useful to extract ensemble averaged properties
of halos, which cannot be obtained with the identification of individual halo.
To demonstrate this point, we show with WIGEON hydrodynamical simulation
samples that the spectrum difference provides a quantitative measurement of the
discrepancy of the distribution of baryonic gas from that of the underlying
dark matter field within halos. We also show that the mass density profile of
halos in physical space can be reconstructed with this statistical measurement.
This profile essentially is the average over an ensemble of halos, including
well virialized halos as well as halos with significant internal substructures.
Moreover, this reconstruction is sensitive to the tail of the mass density
profile. We showed that the profile with $1/r^3$ tail gives very different
result from that of $1/r^2$. Other possible applications of this method are
discussed as well.",2005-04-04T16:49:24Z
"Using the seismology of non-magnetic chemically peculiar stars as a
  probe of dynamical processes in stellar interiors","Chemical composition is a good tracer of hydrodynamical processes that occur
in stars as they often lead to mixing and particle transport. By comparing
abundances predicted by models and those observed in stars we can infer some
constraints on those mixing processes. As pulsations in stars are often very
sensitive to chemical composition, we can use asteroseismology to probe the
internal chemical composition of stars where no direct observations are
possible. In this paper I focus on main sequence stars Am, lambda bootis, and
HgMn stars and discuss what we can learn of mixing processes in those stars
from seismology.",2005-08-05T21:14:14Z

"Diffuse light in z~0.25 galaxy clusters: constraining tidal damage and
  the faint end of the Luminosity Function","The starlight coming from the intergalactic space in galaxy clusters and
groups witnesses the violent tidal interactions that galaxies experience in
these dense environments. Such interactions may be (at least partly)
responsible for the transformation of normal star-forming galaxies into passive
dwarf ellipticals (dEs). In this contribution we present the first systematic
study of the IntraCluster Light (ICL) for a statistically representative sample
(Zibetti et al. 2005), which comprises 683 clusters selected between z=0.2 and
0.3 from ~1500 deg^2 in the SDSS. Their ICL is studied by stacking the images
in the g-, r-, and i-band after masking out all galaxies and polluting sources.
In this way a very uniform background illumination is obtained, that allows us
to measure surface brightnesses as faint as 31 mag/arcsec^2 and to trace the
ICL out to 700 kpc from the central galaxy. We find that the local fraction of
light contributed by intracluster stars rapidly decreases as a function of the
clustercentric distance, from ~40% at 100 kpc to ~5% at 500 kpc. By comparing
the distribution and colours of the ICL and of the clusters galaxies, we find
indication that the main source of ICL are the stars stripped from galaxies
that plunge deeply into the cluster potential well along radial orbits. Thus,
if dEs are the remnants of these stripped progenitors we should expect similar
radial orbital anisotropies and correlations between the dE luminosity function
and the amount of ICL in different clusters. The diffuse emission we measure is
contaminated by faint unresolved galaxies: this makes our flux estimate depend
to some extent on the assumed luminosity function, but, on the other hand,
allows us to constrain the number of faint galaxies. Our present results
disfavour steep (alpha<-1.35) faint-end powerlaw slopes.",2005-04-21T07:47:42Z
Photometric observations from theoretical flip-flop models,"Some active stars show a so-called flip-flop phenomenon in which the main
spot activity periodically switches between two active longitudes that are 180
degrees apart. In this paper we study the flip-flop phenomenon by converting
results from dynamo calculations into long-term synthetic photometric
observations, which are then compared to the real stellar observations. We show
that similar activity patterns as obtained from flip-flop dynamo calculations,
can also be seen in the observations. The long-term light-curve behaviour seen
in the synthesised data can be used for finding new stars exhibiting the
flip-flop phenomenon.",2005-06-13T10:26:24Z
"Chandra Study of X-Ray Point Sources in the Early-Type Galaxy NGC 4552
  (M89)","We present a Chandra ACIS study of the early-type galaxy NGC 4552. We detect
47 X-ray point sources, most of which are likely LMXBs, within 4 R_e. The
brightest X-ray source coincides with the optical/UV/radio center of the
galaxy, and shows variability on >1 hr timescales, indicating the possible
existence of a LLAGN. The 46 off-center sources and the unresolved point
sources contribute about 29% and 20% to the total luminosity of the galaxy,
respectively. The corrected cumulative XLF of the off-center sources is best
fit by a broken power-law model with a break at L_b=4.4+2.0-1.4 e38 ergs/s. We
identified 210 GCs candidates in a HST WFPC2 optical image of the galaxy's
central region. Of the 25 off-center LMXBs that fall within the WFPC2 FOV, 10
sources are coincident with a GC. Thus the fraction of the GCs hosting bright
LMXBs and the fraction of the LMXBs associated with GCs are 4.8% and 40%,
respectively. In the V and I bands, the GCs hosting bright LMXBs are typically
1-2 magnitudes brighter than the GCs with no detected LMXBs. There are about
1.9+-0.4 times as many LMXBs in the red, metal-rich GCs as there are in the
blue, metal-poor ones. We find no obvious difference between the luminosity
distributions of LMXBs in GCs and in field, but the cumulative spectrum of the
LMXBs in GCs tends to be softer than that of the LMXBs in field. We detected 3
X-ray sources that have isotropic luminosities larger than 1e39 erg/s. The one
located in the joint Chandra-HST field is found to be associated with a GC. By
studying the ACIS spectra we infer that the this may be a candidate black hole
system with a mass of 15-135 M_sun. One of the other sources with a luminosity
brighter than 1e39 ergs/s reveals temporal variations in brightness on
timescales greater than an hour.",2005-06-12T08:31:10Z
"Globular Clusters in Virgo Ellipticals: Unexpected Results for Giants,
  Dwarfs, and Nuclei from ACS Imaging","We have analyzed archival HST/ACS images in Sloan g and z of the globular
cluster (GC) systems of 53 ellipticals in the Virgo Cluster, spanning massive
galaxies to dEs. Among the new results are: (1) In the gEs M87 and NGC 4649,
there is a correlation between luminosity and color for individual metal-poor
GCs, such that more massive GCs are more metal-rich. A plausible interpretation
of this result is self-enrichment, and may suggest that these GCs once
possessed dark matter halos. (2) Many dEs have metal-rich GC subpopulations. We
also confirm the GC color--galaxy luminosity relations found previously for
both metal-poor and metal-rich GC subpopulations. (3) There are large
differences in GC specific frequency among dEs. Over -15 < M_B < -18, there is
little correlation between specific frequency (S_N)and M_B. But we do find
evidence for two separate S_N classes of dEs: those with B-band S_N ~ 2, and
others with populous GC systems that have S_N ranging from ~ 5-20 with median
S_N ~ 10. Together, these points suggest multiple formation channels for dEs in
Virgo. (4) The peak of the GC luminosity function (GCLF) is the same for both
gEs and dEs. This is contrary to expectations of dynamical friction on massive
GCs, unless the primordial GCLF varies between gEs and dEs. Among gEs the GCLF
turnover varies by a surprising small 0.05 mag, an encouraging result for its
use as an accurate standard candle. (5) dE,Ns appear bimodal in their nuclear
properties: there are small bright red nuclei consistent with formation by
dynamical friction of GCs, and larger faint blue nuclei which appear to have
formed by a dissipative process with little contribution from GCs. The role of

"The circumstellar environment of T Tau S at high spatial and spectral
  resolution","We have obtained the first high spatial (0.05'') and spectral (R~35000)
resolution 2 micron spectrum of the T Tau S tight binary system using adaptive
optics on the Keck II telescope. We have also obtained the first 3.8 and 4.7
micron images that resolve the three components of the T Tau multiple system,
as well as new 1.6 and 2.2 micron images. Together with its very red
near-infrared colors, the spectrum of T Tau Sb shows that this T Tauri star is
extincted by a roughly constant extinction of Av~15 mag, which is probably the
0.7''x0.5'' circumbinary structure recently observed in absorption in the
ultraviolet. T Tau Sa, which is also observed through this screen and is
actively accreting, further possesses a small edge-on disk that is evidenced by
warm (390 K), narrow overtone CO rovibrational absorption features in our
spectrum. We find that T Tau Sa is most likely an intermediate-mass star
surrounded by a semi-transparent 2-3 AU-radius disk whose asymmetries and short
Keplerian rotation explain the large photometric variability of the source on
relatively short timescales. We also show that molecular hydrogen emission
exclusively arises from the gas that surrounds T Tau S and that its spatial and
kinematic structure, while providing suggestive evidence for a jet-like
structure, is highly complex.",2005-04-15T15:20:27Z
"Spiral Structure when Setting up Pericentre Glow: Possible Giant Planets
  at Hundreds of AU in the HD141569 Disk","This paper discusses the impact of introducing a planet on an eccentric orbit
into a planetesimal disk. That planet's secular perturbations cause the orbits
of the planetesimals to evolve in such a way that at any one time planetesimals
at the same distance from the star have common pericentres and eccentricities.
This causes the surface density distribution of an extended planetesimal disk
to exhibit two spirals, one exterior the other interior to the planet's orbit.
These two spirals unwind in different directions and their structure is
described by two parameters: the time since the planet was introduced and the
planet's eccentricity. At late times the spirals become tightly wound and the
offset centre of symmetry of the pericentre glow approximation is recovered.
Comparison with spiral structure seen in the HD141569 disk shows that its
spiral at 325 AU is similar to that caused by introducing a planet 5 Myr ago
with a mass 0.2-2M_Jup orbiting at 235-250 AU with an eccentricity of 0.05-0.2;
likewise a Saturn mass planet at 150 AU would cause structure like that seen at
200 AU. More definitive statements about any planets orbiting HD141569 from
this model could be made once the effect of the binary companion on the disk is
known, and once the disk's structure has been better characterised down to 100
AU, including the location of the star within the disk. The relatively young
age of this system (~5 Myr) means that if giant planets really do exist at
hundreds of AU from HD141569, this provides a unique opportunity to set
constraints on the mechanism by which those planets came to be at such large
distances.",2005-06-09T15:10:42Z
"Chandra sample of nearby relaxed galaxy clusters: mass, gas fraction,
  and mass-temperature relation","We present gas and total mass profiles for 13 low-redshift, relaxed clusters
spanning a temperature range 0.7-9 keV, derived from all available Chandra data
of sufficient quality. In all clusters, gas temperature profiles are measured
to large radii (Vikhlinin et al.) so that direct hydrostatic mass estimates are
possible to nearly r_500 or beyond. The gas density was accurately traced to
larger radii; its profile is not described well by a beta-model, showing
continuous steepening with radius. The derived rho_tot profiles and their
scaling with mass generally follow the Navarro-Frenk-White model with
concentration expected for dark matter halos in LambdaCDM cosmology. In the
inner region (r<0.1r_500), the gas density and temperature profiles exhibit
significant scatter and trends with mass, but they become nearly self-similar
at larger radii. Correspondingly, we find that the slope of the
mass-temperature relation for these relaxed clusters is in good agreement with
the simple self-similar behavior, M_500 ~ T^alpha, where alpha=(1.5-1.6)+-0.1,
if the gas temperatures are measured excluding the central cool cores. The
normalization of this M-T relation is significantly, by =~ 30%, higher than
most previous X-ray determinations. We derive accurate gas mass fraction
profiles, which show increase both with radius and cluster mass. The enclosed
f_gas profiles within r_2500 =~ 0.4 r_500 have not yet reached any asymptotic
value and are still far (by a factor of 1.5-2) from the Universal baryon
fraction according to the CMB observations. The f_gas trends become weaker and
its values closer to Universal at larger radii, in particular, in spherical
shells r_2500<r<r_500.",2005-07-05T12:21:35Z
"A large spin-up rate measured with INTEGRAL in the High Mass X-ray
  Binary Pulsar SAXJ2103.5+4545","The High Mass X-ray Binary Pulsar SAXJ2103.5+4545 has been observed with
INTEGRAL several times during the last outburst in 2002-2004. We report a
comprehensive study of all INTEGRAL observations, allowing a study of the pulse
period evolution during the recent outburst. We measured a very rapid spin-up
episode, lasting 130days, which decreased the pulse period by 1.8s. The spin-up
rate, pdot=-1.5e-7 s/s, is the largest ever measured for SAXJ2103.5+4545, and
it is among the fastest for an accreting pulsar. The pulse profile shows
evidence for temporal variability, apparently not related to the source flux or
to the orbital phase. The X-ray spectrum is hard and there is significant
emission up to 150keV. A new derivation of the orbital period, based on RXTE
data, is also reported.",2005-05-26T11:18:20Z
"Kappa-mechanism excitation of retrograde mixed modes in rotating B-type
  stars","I examine the stability of retrograde mixed modes in rotating B-type stars.
These modes can be regarded as a hybrid between the Rossby modes that arise
from conservation of vorticity, and the Poincare modes that are gravity waves
modified by the Coriolis force. Using a non-adiabatic pulsation code based
around the traditional approximation, I find that the modes are unstable in
mid- to late-B type stars, due to the same iron-bump opacity mechanism usually
associated with SPB and $\beta$ Cep stars. At one half of the critical rotation
rate, the instability for $m=1...4$ modes spans the spectral types B4 to A0.
Inertial-frame periods of the unstable modes range from 100 days down to a
fraction of a day, while normalized growth rates can reach in excess of
$10^{-5}$.
  I discuss the relevance of these findings to SPB and pulsating Be stars, and
to the putative Maia class of variable star. I also outline some of the
questions raised by this discovery of a wholly-new class of pulsational
instability in early-type stars.",2005-06-24T01:46:42Z
Inverse Compton X-ray Flare from GRB Reverse Shock,"We study synchrotron self-inverse Compton radiation from a reverse-shocked
fireball. If the inverse Compton process dominates the cooling of shocked
electrons, an X-ray flare produced by the first order Compton scattering would
emerge in the very early afterglow phase, with the bulk of the shock energy
radiated in the second order scattering component at 10-100 MeV. The dominance
of inverse Compton cooling leads to the lack of prompt optical flashes. We show
that for plausible parameters this scattering process can produce an X-ray
flare with a relative amplitude change by a factor of several. Flares with a
larger amplitude and multiple X-ray flares in a single event are likely to be
produced by another mechanism (e.g. internal shocks).",2005-06-08T00:39:44Z
Discovery of a widely separated binary system of very low mass stars,"We report our discovery of a nearby wide binary system, LP 714-37 AB.
Phan-Bao et al. identified LP 714-37 as a mid-M dwarf during a
cross-identification of the NLTT and DENIS catalogues. Our CCD images resolve
the system into a binary with a projected angular separation of 1.8 arcsec, or
33 AU, and low-resolution optical spectra give spectral types of M5.5 (LP
714-37A) and M7.5 (LP 714-37B). This makes LP 714-37 AB one of very few widely
separated (separation > 30 AU) very low-mass binary systems known in the field,
and we discuss it in the context of the multiplicity properties of very
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.",2005-06-25T06:48:30Z
"First Ultraviolet Spectrum of a Brown Dwarf: Evidence for H_2
  Fluorescence and Accretion","We analyze an HST/STIS ultraviolet spectrum of the young brown dwarf 2MASSW
J1207334-393254, a member of the ten million-year old TW Hya Association that
has a planetary-mass companion. We detect and identify numerous emission lines.
CIV and other ions are seen that arise in hot gas. We identify a series of
lines with Lyman-pumped H_2 molecular lines, indicating that cool gas is also
present. Overall, this substellar object shows many of the same characteristics
as classical T Tauri stars. We interpret our results as direct evidence of
accretion from a circumstellar gas disk, consistent with previous claims. The
lack of SiIV emission from the accreting gas indicates that silicon has been
depleted into grains.",2005-07-19T04:37:59Z
Cosmic ray threshold in an asymptotically dS spacetime,"We discuss the threshold anomaly in ultra-high energy cosmic ray physics by
assuming that the matter world just be perturbation of a de Sitter universe,
which is consistent with the recent astronomical observations: about two thirds
of the whole energy in the universe is contributed by a small positive
cosmological constant. One-particle states are presented explicitly. It is
noticed that the dispersion relation of free particles is dependent on the
degrees of freedom of angular momentum. This fact can be regarded as the
effects of the cosmological constant on kinematics of particles.",2005-05-31T08:46:57Z
"Exclusion Limits on the WIMP-Nucleon Cross-Section from the First Run of
  the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search in the Soudan Underground Lab","The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS-II) employs low-temperature Ge and Si
detectors to seek Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) via their
elastic scattering interactions with nuclei. Simultaneous measurements of both
ionization and phonon energy provide discrimination against interactions of
background particles. For recoil energies above 10 keV, events due to
background photons are rejected with >99.99% efficiency. Electromagnetic events
very near the detector surface can mimic nuclear recoils because of reduced
charge collection, but these surface events are rejected with >96% efficiency
by using additional information from the phonon pulse shape. Efficient use of
active and passive shielding, combined with the the 2090 m.w.e. overburden at
the experimental site in the Soudan mine, makes the background from neutrons
negligible for this first exposure. All cuts are determined in a blind manner
from in situ calibrations with external radioactive sources without any prior
knowledge of the event distribution in the signal region. Resulting
efficiencies are known to ~10%. A single event with a recoil of 64 keV passes
all of the cuts and is consistent with the expected misidentification rate of
surface-electron recoils. Under the assumptions for a standard dark matter
halo, these data exclude previously unexplored parameter space for both
spin-independent and spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering. The
resulting limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic-scattering
cross-section has a minimum of 4x10^-43 cm^2 at a WIMP mass of 60 GeV/c^2. The
minimum of the limit for the spin-dependent WIMP-neutron elastic-scattering
cross-section is 2x10^-37 cm^2 at a WIMP mass of 50 GeV/c^2.",2005-07-08T00:33:21Z
Is the Universe odd?,"We investigate the point-parity and mirror-parity handedness of the large
angle anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In particular we
consider whether the observed low CMB quadrupole could more generally signal
odd point-parity, i.e. suppression of even multipoles. Even though this feature
is ``visually'' present in most renditions of the WMAP dataset we find that it
never supports parity preference beyond the meagre 95% confidence level. This
is fortunate as point parity handedness implies almost certainly a high level
of galactic contamination. Mirror reflection parity, on the contrary, is
related to the emergence of a preferred axis, defining the symmetry plane. We
use this technique to make contact with recent claims for an anisotropic
Universe, showing that the detected preferred axis is associated with positive
(even) mirror parity. This feature may be an important clue in identifying the
culprit for this unexpected signal.",2005-07-12T14:07:47Z
"Instabilities, turbulence, and mixing in the ocean of accreting neutron
  stars","We consider the stability properties of the ocean of accreting magnetic
neutron stars. It turns out that the ocean is always unstable due to the
combined influence of the temperature and chemical composition gradients along
the surface and of the Hall effect. Both the oscillatory and non-oscillatory
modes can be unstable in accreting stars. The oscillatory instability grows on
a short timescale of the order os 0.1-10 s depending on the lengthscale of a
surface inhomogeneity and the wavelength of perturbations. The instability of
non-oscillatory modes is typically much slower and can develop on a timescale
of hours or days. Instability generates a weak turbulence that can be
responsible for mixing between the surface and deep ocean layers and for
spreading the accreted material over the stellar surface. Spectral features of
heavy elements can be detected in the atmospheres of accreting stars due to
mixing, and these features should be different in neutron stars with stable and
unstable burning. Motions caused by instability can also be the reason for slow
variations in the luminosity.",2005-04-20T13:58:14Z
The H I opacity of the intergalactic medium at redshifts 1.6 < z < 3.2,"We use high quality echelle spectra of 24 QSOs to provide a calibrated
measurement of the total amount of Lyman-alpha forest absorption (DA) over the
redshift range 2.2 < z < 3.2. Our measurement of DA excludes absorption from
metal lines or the Lyman-alpha lines of Lyman limit systems and damped
Lyman-alpha systems. We use artificial spectra with realistic flux calibration
errors to show that we are able to place continuum levels that are accurate to
better than 1%. When we combine our results with our previous results between
1.6 < z < 2.2, we find that the redshift evolution of DA is well described over
1.6 < z < 3.2 as A*(1+z)^gamma, where A = 0.0062 and gamma = 2.75. We detect no
significant deviations from a smooth power law evolution over the redshift
range studied. We find less H I absorption than expected at z=3, implying that
the UV background is about 40% higher than expected. Our data appears to be
consistent with an H I ionization rate of Gamma ~ 1.4E-12 1/s.",2005-04-18T17:14:46Z
"The Link Between Star Formation and Accretion in LINERs: A Comparison
  with other AGN Subclasses","We present archival high resolution X-ray imaging observations of 25 nearby
LINERs observed by ACIS on board Chandra. This sample builds on our previously
published proprietary and archival X-ray observations, and includes the
complete set of LINERs with published black hole masses and FIR luminosities
that have been observed by Chandra. Of the 82 LINERs observed by Chandra, 41
(50%) display hard nuclear cores consistent with an AGN. The nuclear 2-10 keV
luminosities of these AGN-LINERs range from ~ 2 X 10^38 ergs s^-1 to ~ 1 X
10^44 ergs s^-1. Reinforcing our previous work, we find a significant
correlation between the Eddington ratio, L bol/LEdd, and the far-IR (FIR)
luminosity, LFIR, as well as the IR brightness ratio, LFIR/LB in the host
galaxy of AGN-LINERs that extends over seven orders of magnitude in Lbol/LEdd.
Combining our AGN-LINER sample with galaxies from other AGN subclasses, we find
that this correlation is reinforced in the full sample of 129 AGN, extending
over almost nine orders of magnitude in Lbol/LEdd. Using archival and
previously published observations of the 6.2 mm PAH feature from the Infrared
Space Observatory (ISO), we find that it is unlikely that dust heating by the
AGN dominates the FIR luminosity in our sample of AGN. Our results may
therefore imply a fundamental link between the mass accretion rate (Mdot), as
measured by the Eddington ratio, and the star formation rate (SFR), as measured
by the FIR luminosity.",2005-07-27T15:59:06Z
"Statistical Analysis of Galaxy Surveys-II. The 3-point galaxy
  correlation function measured from the 2dFGRS","We present new results for the 3-point correlation function, \zeta, measured
as a function of scale, luminosity and colour from the final version of the
two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). The reduced three point
correlation function, Q_3 is estimated for different triangle shapes and sizes,
employing a full covariance analysis. The form of Q_3 is consistent with the
expectations for the \Lambda-cold dark matter model, confirming that the
primary influence shaping the distribution of galaxies is gravitational
instability acting on Gaussian primordial fluctuations. However, we find a
clear offset in amplitude between Q_3 for galaxies and the predictions for the
dark matter. We are able to rule out the scenario in which galaxies are
unbiased tracers of the mass at the 9-sigma level. On weakly non-linear scales,
we can interpret our results in terms of galaxy bias parameters. We find a
linear bias term that is consistent with unity, b_1 = 0.93^{+0.10}_{-0.08} and
a quadratic bias c_2 = b_2 /b_1 = -0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.08}. This is the first
significant detection of a non-zero quadratic bias, indicating a small but
important non-gravitational contribution to the three point function. Our
estimate of the linear bias from the three point function is independent of the
normalisation of underlying density fluctuations, so we can combine this with
the measurement of the power spectrum of 2dFGRS galaxies to constrain the
amplitude of matter fluctuations. We find that the rms linear theory variance
in spheres of radius 8Mpc/h is \sigma_8 = 0.88^{+0.12}_{-0.10}, providing an
independent confirmation of values derived from other techniques. On non-linear
scales, where \xi>1, we find that Q_3 has a strong dependence on scale, colour
and luminosity.",2005-06-12T21:38:42Z
An XMM-Newton Study of the Coronae of $σ^2$ Coronae Borealis,"(Abridged) We present results of XMM-Newton observations of the RS CVn binary
$\sigma^2$ Coronae Borealis. The RGS and EPIC MOS2 spectra were simultaneously
fitted with collisional ionization equilibrium plasma models to determine
coronal abundances of various elements. Contrary to the solar first ionization
potential (FIP) effect in which elements with a low FIP are overabundant in the
corona compared to the solar photosphere, and contrary to the ``inverse'' FIP
effect observed in several active RS CVn binaries, coronal abundance ratios in
$\sigma^2$ CrB show a complex pattern as supported by similar findings in the
Chandra HETGS analysis of $\sigma^2$ CrB with a different methodology (Osten et
al. 2003). Low-FIP elements ($<10$ eV) have their abundance ratios relative to
Fe consistent with the solar photospheric ratios, whereas high-FIP elements
have their abundance ratios increase with increasing FIP. We find that the
coronal Fe abundance is consistent with the stellar photospheric value,
indicating that there is no metal depletion in $\sigma^2$ CrB. However, we
obtain a higher Fe absolute abundance than in Osten et al. (2003). Except for
Ar and S, our absolute abundances are about 1.5 times larger than those
reported by Osten et al. (2003). However, a comparison of their model with our
XMM-Newton data (and vice versa) shows that both models work adequately in
general. We find, therefore, no preference for one methodology over the other
to derive coronal abundances. Despite the systematic discrepancy in absolute
abundances, our abundance ratios are very close to those obtained by Osten et
al. (2003). Finally, we confirm the measurement of a low density in \ion{O}{7}
($< 4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), but could not confirm the higher densities
measured in spectral lines formed at higher temperatures.",2005-06-10T16:03:24Z
"The nature of the X-ray halo of the plerion G21.5-0.9 unveiled by
  XMM-Newton and Chandra","The nature of the radio-quiet X-ray halo around the plerionic SNR G21.5-0.9
is under debate. On the basis of spatial and spectral analysis of a large
Chandra and XMM-Newton dataset of this source, we have developed a
self-consistent scenario which explains all the observational features. We
found that the halo is composed by diffuse extended emission due to dust
scattering of X-rays from the plerion, by a bright limb which traces particle
acceleration in the fast forward shock of the remnant, and by a bright spot
(the ``North Spur'') which may be a knot of ejecta in adiabatic expansion. By
applying a model of interaction between the PWN, the SNR and supernova
environment, we argue that G21.5-0.9 progenitor may be of Type IIP or Ib/Ic,
and that the remnant may be young (200-1000 yr).",2005-07-21T17:59:58Z
"Broad-band electromagnetic radiation from microquasars interacting with
  ISM","Microquasars (MQs) are galactic objects with relativistic jets that
constitute a source population which can be responsible for production of a
non-negligible fraction of the observed galactic cosmic rays. These
relativistic protons, associated with the termination of the jet, interact with
the interstellar medium and, at certain surrounding conditions, may lead to
production of detectable fluxes of high-energy and very high-energy gamma-rays.
This radiation is accompanied by the broad-band emission of secondary electrons
from decays of $\pi^\pm$-mesons produced through synchrotron, bremstrahlung and
inverse Compton process. The features of broad-band emission initiated by
proton-proton (pp) interactions in such a scenario is discussed in the context
of the strategy of search for counterparts of high-energy and very high-energy
gamma-ray sources in the galactic plane.",2005-07-18T14:43:49Z
Galaxy Rotation Curves Without Non-Baryonic Dark Matter,"We apply the modified acceleration law obtained from Einstein gravity coupled
explaining galaxy rotation curves without exotic dark matter. Our sample of
galaxies includes low surface brightness (LSB) and high surface brightness
(HSB) galaxies, and an elliptical galaxy. In those cases where photometric data
are available, a best fit via the single parameter (M/L)_{stars} to the
luminosity of the gaseous (HI plus He) and luminous stellar disks is obtained.
Additionally, a best fit to the rotation curves of galaxies is obtained in
terms of a parametric mass distribution (independent of luminosity
observations) -- a two parameter fit to the total galactic mass, (or
mass-to-light ratio M/L), and a core radius associated with a model of the
galaxy cores using a nonlinear least-squares fitting routine including
estimated errors. The fits are compared to those obtained using Milgrom's
phenomenological MOND model and to the predictions of the Newtonian-Kepler
acceleration law.",2005-06-16T13:32:01Z
Exact solution of the standard transfer problem in a stellar atmosphere,"We come back to the analytical solution of the standard transfer problem in a
stellar atmosphere. It consists in solving the radiative transfer equation in a
homogeneous and isothermal plane-parallel atmosphere, with light scattering
taken as isotropic and monochromatic. The literature on the subject is reviewed
and the existing solution in a finite slab is improved thanks to the
introduction of non classical auxiliary functions. Eleven-figure tables of the
solution are given for typical values of the input parameters currently met in
stellar atmospheres.",2005-04-03T13:59:17Z
"Which physical parameters can be inferred from the emission variability
  of relativistic jets?","We present results of a detailed numerical study and theoretical analysis of
the dynamics of internal shocks in relativistic jets and the non-thermal flares
associated with these shocks. In our model internal shocks result from
collisions of density inhomogeneities (shells) in relativistic jet flows. We
find that the merged shell resulting from the inelastic collision of shells has
a complicated internal structure due to the non-linear dynamics of the
interaction. Furthermore, the instantaneous efficiency for converting kinetic
energy into thermal energy is found to be almost twice as high as theoretically
expected during the period of significant emission. The Lorentz factors of the
internal shocks are correlated with the initial inertial masses of the shells.
  Because of the complexity of the non-linear evolution the merged shell
becomes very inhomogeneous and simple one-zone models are inadequate to extract
physical parameters of the emitting region from the resulting light curves. In
order to improve on these one-zone approximations, we propose a novel way of
analyzing the space-time properties of the emission. Based on these properties
we construct an analytic model of non-thermal flares which can be used to
constrain some (unobservable) physical parameters of the internal shocks. These
are the ratio of the Lorentz factors between the forward and the reverse shock
(caused by the shell collision), and the shell crossing times of these shocks.
The analytic model is validated by applying it to the synthetic light curves
computed from our models. It can equally well be applied to observations.",2005-06-27T11:43:47Z
"Corrections of Errors in `The First Detections of the Extragalactic
  Background Light at 3000, 5500, and 8000 Å. I, II, and III'","We correct errors in Bernstein, Freedman & Madore (2002abc), a series of
papers in which we described observations of the optical extragalactic
background light (EBL). These errors pertain to the measurement of zodiacal
light, given in the second paper of this series. Making these corrections leads
to a net decrease of 0.5($\pm$0.6)% in our zodiacal light measurement and a
corresponding increase in the inferred extragalactic background light of
roughly $0.5 (\pm 0.6) \times 10^{-9}$ ergs sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$
\AA$^{-1}$. For comparison, the originally--quoted EBL flux at 5500\AA was $2.7
(\pm1.4) \times 10^{-9}$ in the same units ($1\sigma$ combined systematic and
statistical uncertainty). We provide a detailed discussion of these errors and
also discuss the evolution of this work prior to the (2002) papers. We note
that corrections of the factual errors in our (2002) papers yield a result that
is consistent with the results and errors quoted there. However, this is not
intended to be a new or updated analysis, and it does not address some
methodological objections which have been raised to our prior work.",2005-07-01T16:52:09Z
On the Properties of the HI shells in the Small Magellanic CLoud,"There are 509 expanding neutral hydrogen shells catalogued in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC), all apparently very young, with dynamical ages of a few
Myr. To examine their relationship with young stellar objects we
cross-correlated the shell catalogue with various catalogues of OB
associations, super giants, Cepheids, WR stars, supernova remnants, and star
clusters. The incidence of chance line-ups was estimated via Monte-Carlo
simulations, and found to be high. However, it is important that there are 1.5
times more shells that are {\em not} spatially correlated to an OB association,
than shells that are. Moreover, 59 of the 509 shells lie mainly in low stellar
density fields and have no young stellar objects associated with them, and
therefore no obvious energy source. It is shown that, on the whole, the
properties of these ""empty"" shells are very similar to the properties of the
rest of the shells, once selection biases are taken into account. Theoretical
implications of the results are discussed.",2005-04-20T13:30:07Z
Grain Evolution across the Shocks in the L1448-mm Outflow,"The recent detection of shock-precursors toward the very young L1448-mm
outflow offers us the possibility to study the grain chemistry during the first
stages of the shock evolution, constraining the molecules ejected from grains
and the species formed in gas phase. Observations of key molecules in the grain
chemistry such as SiO, CH3OH, SO, CS, H2S, OCS, and SO2 toward this outflow are
presented. The line profiles and the derived abundances show three distinct
velocity regimes that trace the shock evolution: the preshock, the
shock-precursor and the postshock gas. The SiO, CH3OH, SO, and CS abundances
are enhanced with respect to the quiescent gas by 1 order of magnitude in the
shock-precursor component, and by 3 orders of magnitude in the postshock gas.
The derived SiO and CH3OH abundances are consistent with the recent ejection of
these molecules from grains. Since H2S is only enhanced in the shock-precursor
component, and OCS and SO2 are undetected, SO and CS are the most abundant
sulfur-bearing species in the grain mantles of L1448-mm. The ejection of mainly
SO and CS rather than H2S or OCS from grains, suggests that the sulfur
chemistry will depend on the chemical ""history"" of the grain mantles in
outflows and hot cores.",2005-06-17T11:21:15Z
Long-Term INTEGRAL and RXTE Observations of the X-Ray Pulsar LMC X-4,"We analyze the observations of the X-ray pulsar LMC X-4 performed by the
INTEGRAL observatory and the All-Sky Monitor (ASM) of the RXTE observatory over
a wide energy range. The observed hard X-ray flux from the source is shown to
change by more than a factor of 50 (from ~70 mCrab in the high state to ~1.3
mCrab in the low state) on the time scale of the accretion-disk precession
period, whose mean value for 1996-2004 was determined with a high accuracy,
Pprec=30.275+/-0.004 days. In the low state, a flare about 10 h in duration was
detected from the source; the flux from the source increased by more than a
factor of 4 during this flare. The shape of the pulsar's broadband spectrum is
essentially invariable with its intensity; no statistically significant
features associated with the possible resonance cyclotron absorption line were
found in the spectrum of the source.",2005-04-27T15:09:09Z
From Hubble diagrams to scale factors,"We present a lower bound on the radius of the universe today $a_0$ and a

  Observed by the Tibet Air Shower Array","We present the large-scale sidereal anisotropy ofgalactic cosmic-ray
intensity in the multi-TeV region observed with the Tibet-IIIair shower array
during the period from 1999 through 2003. The sidereal daily variation of
cosmic rays observed in this experiment shows an excess of relative intensity
around $4\sim7 $ hours local sidereal time, as well as a deficit around 12
hours local sidereal time. While the amplitude of the excess is not significant
when averaged over all declinations, the excess in individual declinaton bands
becomes larger and clearer as the viewing direction moves toward the south. The
maximum phase of the excess intensity changes from $\sim$7 at the northern
hemisphere to $\sim$4 hours at the equatorial region. We also show that both
the amplitude and the phase of the first harmonic vector of the daily variation
are remarkably independent of primary energy in the multi-TeV region. This is
the first result determining the energy and declination dependences of the full
24-hour profiles of the sidereal daily variation in the multi-TeV region with a
single air shower experiment.",2005-05-06T05:42:57Z
"Kappa-mechanism excitation of retrograde mixed modes in rotating B-type
  stars","I examine the stability of retrograde mixed modes in rotating B-type stars.
These modes can be regarded as a hybrid between the Rossby modes that arise
from conservation of vorticity, and the Poincare modes that are gravity waves
modified by the Coriolis force. Using a non-adiabatic pulsation code based
around the traditional approximation, I find that the modes are unstable in
mid- to late-B type stars, due to the same iron-bump opacity mechanism usually
associated with SPB and $\beta$ Cep stars. At one half of the critical rotation
rate, the instability for $m=1...4$ modes spans the spectral types B4 to A0.
Inertial-frame periods of the unstable modes range from 100 days down to a
fraction of a day, while normalized growth rates can reach in excess of
$10^{-5}$.
  I discuss the relevance of these findings to SPB and pulsating Be stars, and
to the putative Maia class of variable star. I also outline some of the
questions raised by this discovery of a wholly-new class of pulsational
instability in early-type stars.",2005-06-24T01:46:42Z
"The circumstellar environment of T Tau S at high spatial and spectral
  resolution","We have obtained the first high spatial (0.05'') and spectral (R~35000)
resolution 2 micron spectrum of the T Tau S tight binary system using adaptive
optics on the Keck II telescope. We have also obtained the first 3.8 and 4.7
micron images that resolve the three components of the T Tau multiple system,
as well as new 1.6 and 2.2 micron images. Together with its very red
near-infrared colors, the spectrum of T Tau Sb shows that this T Tauri star is
extincted by a roughly constant extinction of Av~15 mag, which is probably the
0.7''x0.5'' circumbinary structure recently observed in absorption in the
ultraviolet. T Tau Sa, which is also observed through this screen and is
actively accreting, further possesses a small edge-on disk that is evidenced by
warm (390 K), narrow overtone CO rovibrational absorption features in our
spectrum. We find that T Tau Sa is most likely an intermediate-mass star
surrounded by a semi-transparent 2-3 AU-radius disk whose asymmetries and short
Keplerian rotation explain the large photometric variability of the source on
relatively short timescales. We also show that molecular hydrogen emission
exclusively arises from the gas that surrounds T Tau S and that its spatial and
kinematic structure, while providing suggestive evidence for a jet-like
structure, is highly complex.",2005-04-15T15:20:27Z
"Oxygen in Galactic Disk Stars: non-LTE abundances from the 777 nm O I
  triplet","Oxygen abundances for a large sample of dwarf and giant stars kinematically
selected to be part of the Galactic thin and thick disks have been determined
from a non-LTE analysis of the O I triplet lines at 777 nm. The abundance
analysis was performed using the infrared flux method temperature scale,
trigonometric surface gravities, and accurate atomic data. Within this
framework, the ionization balance of iron lines could not be satisfied and so
we adopted the iron abundances from Fe II lines only given that they are
relatively less sensitive to changes in the atmospheric parameters. We show the
resulting [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relationship and briefly discuss its implications.",2005-06-29T21:43:40Z
Phosphorus in the Diffuse Interstellar Medium,"We present FUSE and HST/STIS measurements of the PII column density toward
Galactic stars. We analyzed PII through the profile fitting of the unsaturated
$\lambda$1125 and $\lambda$1533 lines and derived column densities integrated
along the sightlines as well as in individual resolved components. We find that
phosphorus is not depleted along those sightlines sampling the diffuse neutral
gas. We also investigate the correlation existing between PII and OI column
densities and find that there is no differential depletion between these two
specie. Furthermore, the ratio N(PII)/N(OI) is consistent with the solar P/O
value, implying that PII and OI coexist in the same gaseous phase and are
likely to evolve in parallel since the time they are produced in stars. We
argue that phosphorus, as traced by PII, is an excellent neutral oxygen tracer
in various physical environments, except when ionization corrections are a
significant issue. Hence, PII lines (observable with FUSE, HST/STIS, or with
VLT/UVES for the QSO sightlines) reveal particularly useful as a proxy for OI
lines when these are saturated or blended.",2005-07-18T11:44:11Z
"Dust outflows and inner gaps generated by massive planets in debris
  disks","Main sequence stars are commonly surrounded by debris disks, formed by cold
far-IR-emitting dust that is thought to be continuously replenished by a
reservoir of undetected dust-producing planetesimals. We have investigated the
orbital evolution of dust particles in debris disks harboring massive planets.
Small dust grains are blown out by radiation pressure, as is well known; in
addition, gravitational scattering by the giant planets also creates an outflow
of large grains. We describe the characteristics of this large-particle outflow
in different planetary architectures and for different particle sizes. In
addition, the ejection of particles is responsible for the clearing of dust
inside the orbit of the planet. We study the efficiency of particle ejection
and the resulting dust density contrast inside and outside the orbit of the
planet, as a function of the planet's mass and orbital elements and the
particle size. We discuss its implications for exo-planetary debris disks and
for the interpretation of in-situ dust detection experiments on space probes
traveling in the outer solar system.",2005-06-27T21:38:11Z
"The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey: Clustering of Groups and Group
  Galaxies at z~1","We study the clustering properties of groups and of galaxies in groups in the
DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey dataset at z~1. Four clustering measures are
presented: 1) the group correlation function for 460 groups with estimated
velocity dispersions of sigma>200 km/s, 2) the galaxy correlation for the full
galaxy sample, using a flux-limited sample of 9800 objects between 0.7<z<1.0,
3) the galaxy correlation for galaxies in groups, and 4) the group-galaxy
cross-correlation function. Using the observed number density and clustering
amplitude of the groups, the estimated minimum group dark matter halo mass is
M_min~6 10^12 h^-1 M_Sun for a flat LCDM cosmology. Groups are more clustered
than galaxies, with a relative bias of b=1.7 +/-0.04 on scales r_p=0.5-15
Mpc/h. Galaxies in groups are also more clustered than the full galaxy sample,
with a scale-dependent relative bias which falls from b~2.5 +/-0.3 at r_p=0.1
Mpc/h to b~1 +/-0.5 at r_p=10 Mpc/h. The correlation functions for all galaxies
and galaxies in groups can be fit by a power-law on scales r_p=0.05-20 Mpc/h.
We empirically measure the contribution to the projected correlation function
for galaxies in groups from a `one-halo' term and a `two-halo' term by counting
pairs of galaxies in the same or in different groups. The projected
cross-correlation between shows that red galaxies are more centrally
concentrated in groups than blue galaxies at z~1. DEEP2 galaxies in groups
appear to have a shallower radial distribution than that of mock galaxy
catalogs made from N-body simulations, which assume a central galaxy surrounded
by satellite galaxies with an NFW profile. We show that the clustering of
galaxies in groups can be used to place tighter constraints on the halo model
than can be gained from using the usual galaxy correlation function alone.",2005-07-27T20:07:38Z
"X-Ray Timing, Spectroscopy and Photometry of the Anomalous X-Ray Pulsar
  Candidate CXOU J010043.1-721134","We present new X-ray timing and spectral results on the 8.0-second X-ray
pulsar CXOU J010043.1-721134 from a series of observations using the Chandra
X-ray Observatory. We find a spin period in 2004 January of 8.020392pm0.000009
seconds. Comparison of this to 2001 Chandra observations implies a period
derivative dot{P} = (1.88 pm 0.08) times 10^{-11} s s^{-1}, leading to an
inferred dipole surface magnetic field of 3.9 times 10^{14} G. The spectrum is
well fit to an absorbed blackbody of temperature kT = 0.38pm0.02 keV with a
power law tail of photon index Gamma = 2.0pm0.6. We find that the source has an
unabsorbed X-ray flux (0.5-10 keV) of 4(+2-1) times 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}
and a corresponding X-ray luminosity of ~2 times 10^{35} erg s^{-1} for a
distance of 60 kpc. These properties support classification of CXOU
J010043.1-721134 as the seventh confirmed anomalous X-ray pulsar,the eleventh
confirmed magnetar, and the first magnetar to be identified in the Small
Magellanic Cloud.",2005-04-15T22:07:51Z
"X-ray observations of the edge-on star-forming galaxy NGC891 and its
  supernova SN1986J","We present XMM-Newton observations of NCG891, a nearby edge-on spiral galaxy.
We analyse the extent of the diffuse emission emitted from the disk of the
galaxy, and find that it has a single temperature profile with best fitting
temperature of 0.26 keV, though the fit of a dual-temperature plasma with
temperatures of 0.08 and 0.30 keV is also an acceptable fit. There is a
considerable amount of diffuse X-ray emission protruding from the disk in the
NW direction out to approximately 6 kpc. We analyse the point source population
using a Chandra observation, using a maximum likelihood method to find that the
slope of the cumulative luminosity function of point sources in the galaxy is
-0.77^{+0.13}_{-0.1}. Using a sample of other local galaxies, we compare the
X-ray and infrared properties of NGC891 with those of 'normal' and starburst
spiral galaxies, and conclude that NGC891 is most likely a starburst galaxy in
a quiescent state. We establish that the diffuse X-ray luminosity of spirals
scales with the far infra-red luminosity as L_X \propto L_FIR ^{0.87 +- 0.07},
except for extreme starbursts, and NGC891 does not fall in the latter category.
We study the supernova SN1986J in both XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, and
find that the X-ray luminosity has been declining with time more steeply than
expected (L_X \propto t^-3).",2005-06-27T17:50:01Z
Early star formation in the Galaxy from beryllium and oxygen abundances,"We investigate the evolution of the star formation rate in the early Galaxy
using beryllium and oxygen abundances in metal poor stars. Specifically, we
show that stars belonging to two previously identified kinematical classes (the
so-called ``accretion'' and ``dissipative'' populations) are neatly separated
in the [O/Fe] vs. Log(Be/H) diagram. The dissipative population follows the
predictions of our model of Galactic evolution for the thick disk component,
suggesting that the formation of this stellar population occurred on a
timescale significantly longer (by a factor ~5-10) than the accretion
component. The latter shows a large scatter in the [O/Fe] vs. Log(Be/H)
diagram, probably resulting from the inhomogeneous enrichment in oxygen and
iron of the protogalactic gas. Despite the limitation of the sample, the data
suggest that the combined use of products of spallation reactions (like
beryllium) and elemental ratios of stellar nucleosynthesis products (like
[O/Fe]) can constrain theoretical models for the formation and early evolution
of our Galaxy.",2005-05-19T07:41:32Z

A Black Hole in the Galactic Center Complex IRS 13E?,"The IRS 13E complex is an unusual concentration of massive, early-type stars
at a projected distance of ~0.13 pc from the Milky Way's central supermassive
black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Because of their similar proper motion and
their common nature as massive, young stars it has recently been suggested that
IRS 13E may be the remnant of a massive stellar cluster containing an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) that binds its members gravitationally in
the tidal field of Sgr A*. Here, we present an analysis of the proper motions
in the IRS~13E environment that combines the currently best available data with
a time line of 10 years. We find that an IMBH in IRS 13E must have a minimum
mass of ~10^4 solar masses in order to bind the source complex gravitationally.
This high mass limit in combination with the absence so far of compelling
evidence for a non-thermal radio and X-ray source in IRS 13E make it appear
unlikely that an IMBH exists in IRS 13E that is sufficiently massive to bind
the system gravitationally.",2005-04-21T16:23:22Z
"The VVDS-VLA Deep Field II. Optical and near infrared identifications of
  VLA S(1.4GHz)>80 microJy sources in the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey VVDS-02h field","In this paper we present the optical and near-infrared identifications of the
1054 radio sources detected in the 20cm deep radio survey down to a 5sigma flux
limit of about 80 microJy obtained with the VLA in the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey
VVDS-02h deep field. Using U,B,V,R,I and K data, we identified 718 radio
sources (~74% of the whole sample). The photometric redshift analysis shows
that, in each magnitude bin, the radio sample has a higher median photometric
redshift than the whole optical sample, while the median (V-I) color of the
radio sources is redder than the median color of the whole optical sample.
These results suggest that radio detection is preferentially selecting galaxies
with higher intrinsic optical luminosity. From the analysis of the optical
properties of the radio sources as function of the radio flux, we found that
while about 35% of the radio sources are optically unidentified in the higher
radio flux bin (S> 1.0 mJy), the percentage of unidentified sources decreases
to about 25% in the faintest bins (S< 0.5 mJy). The median I magnitude for the
total sample of radio sources,i.e. including also the unidentified ones, is
brighter in the faintest radio bins than in the bin with higher radio flux.
This suggests that most of the faintest radio sources are likely to be
associated to relatively lower radio luminosity objects at relatively modest
redshift, rather than radio-powerful, AGN type objects at high redshift.",2005-06-28T10:03:37Z
AGN-driven convection in galaxy-cluster plasmas,"This paper describes how active galactic nuclei can heat galaxy-cluster
plasmas by driving convection in the intracluster medium. A model is proposed
in which a central supermassive black hole accretes intracluster plasma at the
Bondi rate and powers a radio source. The central radio source produces cosmic
rays, which mix into the thermal plasma. The cosmic-ray luminosity is
proportional to the mass accretion rate. The cosmic-ray pressure gradient
drives convection, which causes plasma heating. It is assumed that plasma
heating balances radiative cooling. The plasma heating rate is self-regulating
because the Bondi accretion rate is a decreasing function of the specific
entropy near the cluster center; if heating exceeds cooling, then the central
entropy increases, the Bondi rate and cosmic-ray luminosity decrease, and the
convective heating rate is reduced. This paper focuses on the role of
intracluster magnetic fields, which affect convection by causing heat and
cosmic rays to diffuse primarily along magnetic field lines. A new stability
criterion is derived for convection in a thermal-plasma/cosmic-ray fluid, and
equations for the average fluid properties in a convective cluster are obtained
with the use of a nonlocal two-fluid mixing length theory. Numerical solutions
of the model equations compare reasonably well with observations without
requiring fine tuning of the model parameters.",2005-06-04T18:39:29Z
Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics,"The principles of Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics are disclosed leading to
a new way to interpret whole-Earth dynamics. Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics
incorporates elements of and unifies the two seemingly divergent dominant
theories of continential displacement, plate tectonics theory and Earth
expansion theory. Whole-Earth decompression is the consequence of Earth
formation from within a Jupiter-like protoplanet with subsequent loss of gases
and ices and concomitant rebounding. The initial whole-Earth decompression is
expected to result in a global system of major primary decompression cracks
appearing in the rigid crust which persist as the basalt feeders for the
global, mid-oceanic ridge system. As the Earth subsequently decompresses, the
area of the Earth's surface increases by the formation of secondary
decompression cracks, often located near the continental margins, presently
identified as oceanic trenches. These secondary decompression cracks are
subsequently in-filled with basalt, extruded from the mid-oceanic ridges, which
traverses the ocean floor by gravitational creep, ultimately plunging into
secondary decompression cracks, emulating subduction. Much of the evidence
presented in support of plate tectonics supports Whole-Earth Decompression
Dynamics, but without necessitating mantle convection/circulation or basalt
re-cycling. Moreover, the timescale for Earth decompression is not constrained
to the last 200 million years, the maximum age of the current ocean floor.",2005-06-30T20:24:21Z
"Deep optical observations of the supernova remnants G 126.2+1.6, G
  59.8+1.2 and G 54.4-0.3","Optical CCD imaging and spectroscopic observations of three supernova
remnants are presented. Optical emission from G 54.4-0.3 and G 59.8+1.2 is
detected for the first time, while the first flux calibrated CCD images of the
supernova remnant G 126.2+1.6 were performed in the optical emission lines of
Halpha+[N II], [O III] and [S II]. A mixture of filamentary and diffuse
structures is observed in G 54.4-0.3 and G 59.8+1.2, mainly in Halpha+[N II],
while the deep optical images of G 126.2+1.6 reveal several new filamentary and
diffuse structures inside the extent of the remnant as defined by its known
radio emission. In all cases, the radio emission is found to be well correlated
with the optical filaments. [O III] emission was not detected at G 54.4-0.3 and
G 59.8+1.2 while in G 126.2+1.6, significant morphological differences between
the low and medium ionization images are present suggesting incomplete shock
structures. Deep long-slit spectra were taken at different positions of the
remnants. Both the flux calibrated images and the long-slit spectra clearly
show that the emission originates from shock-heated gas, while some spectra of
G 126.2+1.6 are characterized by large [O III]/Hbeta ratios. This remnant's [O
III] flux suggests shock velocities into the interstellar ""clouds"" between 100
and 120 km/s, while the [O III] absence in the other two remnants indicates
slower shock velocities. For all remnants, the [S II]6716/6731 ratio indicates
electron densities below 600 cm^{-3} with particularly low densities for G
54.4-0.3 (below 50 cm^{-3}). Finally, the Halpha emission has been measured to
be between 3.0 to 15.2x10^{-17} erg/s/cm^2/ arcsec^2, 3.2x10^{-17} erg/s/cm^2/
arcsec^2 and between 6.5 to 16.8x10^{-17} erg/s/cm^2/ arcsec^2 for G 54.4-0.3,

Observation of the giant radio galaxy M87 at TeV energies with H.E.S.S,"The giant radio galaxy M 87 was observed at TeV energies with the Cherenkov
telescopes of the H.E.S.S. collaboration (High Energy Stereoscopic System). The
observations have been performed in the year 2003 during the comissioning phase
and in 2004 with the full four telescope setup. The observations were motivated
by the measurement of the HEGRA collaboration which reported a 4.7 sigma excess
of TeV gamma-rays from the direction of M 87. The results of the H.E.S.S.
observations - indicating a possible variability of TeV gamma-ray emission from
M 87 (compared to the HEGRA result) - are presented.",2005-04-18T18:46:36Z
"Maximum elastic deformations of compact stars with exotic equations of
  state","I make the first estimates of maximum elastic quadrupole deformations
sustainable by alternatives to conventional neutron stars. Solid strange quark
stars might sustain maximum ellipticities (dimensionless quadrupoles) up to a
few times $10^{-4}$ rather than a few times $10^{-7}$ for conventional neutron
stars, and hybrid quark-baryon or meson-condensate stars might sustain up to
$10^{-5}$. Most of the difference is due to the shear modulus, which can be up
to $10^{33}$ erg/cm$^3$ rather than $10^{30}$ erg/cm$^3$ in the inner crust of
a conventional neutron star. Maximum solid strange star ellipticities are
comparable to upper limits obtained for several known pulsars in a recent
gravitational-wave search by LIGO. Maximum ellipticities of the more robust
hybrid model will be detectable by LIGO at initial design sensitivity. A large
shear modulus also strengthens the case for starquakes as an explanation for
frequent pulsar glitches.",2005-03-17T20:36:21Z

E = mc^2 Without Relativity,"The equivalence of mass and energy is indelibly linked with relativity, both
by scientists and in the popular mind. I prove that E = mc^2 by demanding
momentum conservation of an object that emits two equal electromagnetic wave
packets in opposite directions in its own frame. In contrast to Einstein's
derivation of this equation, which applies energy conservation to a similar
thought experiment, the new derivation employs no effects that are greater than
first order in v/c and therefore does not rely on results from Special
Relativity. In addition to momentum conservation, it uses only aberration of
starlight and the electromagnetic-wave momentum-energy relation p=E/c, both of
which were established by 1884. In particular, no assumption is made about the
constancy of the speed of light, and the derivation proceeds equally well if
one assumes that light is governed by a Galilean transformation. In view of
this, it is somewhat puzzling that the equivalence of mass and energy was not
derived well before the advent of Special Relativity. The new derivation is
simpler and more transparent than Einstein's and is therefore pedagogically
useful.",2005-04-22T15:57:24Z
"Characteristic QSO Accretion Disk Temperatures from Spectroscopic
  Continuum Variability","Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar spectra taken at multiple
epochs, we find that the composite flux density differences in the rest frame
wavelength range 1300-6000 AA can be fit by a standard thermal accretion disk
model where the accretion rate has changed from one epoch to the next (without
considering additional continuum emission components). The fit to the composite
residual has two free parameters: a normalizing constant and the average
characteristic temperature $\bar{T}^*$. In turn the characteristic temperature
is dependent on the ratio of the mass accretion rate to the square of the black
hole mass. We therefore conclude that most of the UV/optical variability may be
due to processes involving the disk, and thus that a significant fraction of
the UV/optical spectrum may come directly from the disk.",2005-06-01T04:22:41Z
"Interstellar 12C/13C ratios through CH+ ll 3957,4232 absorption in local
  clouds: incomplete mixing in the ISM","The 12C/13C isotope ratio is a tracer of stellar yields and the efficiency of
mixing in the ISM. 12CH+/13CH+ is not affected by interstellar chemistry, and
is the most secure way of measuring 12C/13C in the diffuse ISM. R= 12C/13C is
90 in the solar system. Previous measurements of 12CH+ ll3957.7,4232.3 and
13CH+ ll3958.2,4232.0 absorption toward nearby stars indicate some variations
in 12C/13C, with values ranging from 40 to 90 suggesting inefficient mixing.
Except for the cloud toward zeta Oph, these R values are strongly affected by
noise. With UVES on the VLT we have improved on the previous interstellar
12C/13C measurements. The weighted 12C/13C ratio in the local ISM is 78.27 +-
1.83, while the weighted dispersion of our measurements is 12.7, giving a 6.9
sigma scatter. Thus we report on a 6.9 sigma detection of 16.2%
root-mean-square variations in the carbon isotopic ratio on scales of ~100 pc:
R= 74.7 +- 2.3 in the zetaOph cloud, while R = 88.6 +- 3.0 toward HD152235 in
the Lupus clouds, R = 62.2 +- 5.3 towards HD110432 in the Coalsack, and R =
98.9 +- 10.1 toward HD170740. The observed variations in 13C/12C are the first
significant detection of chemical heterogeneity in the local ISM.",2005-06-03T16:34:07Z
"X-ray Diagnostics of Grain Depletion in Matter Accreting onto T Tauri
  Stars","Recent analysis of high resolution Chandra X-ray spectra has shown that the
Ne/O abundance ratio is remarkably constant in stellar coronae. Based on this
result, we point out the utility of the Ne/O ratio as a discriminant for
accretion-related X-rays from T Tauri stars, and for probing the measure of
grain-depletion of the accreting material in the inner disk. We apply the Ne/O
diagnostic to the classical T Tauri stars BP Tau and TW Hya--the two stars
found to date whose X-ray emission appears to originate, at least in part, from
accretion activity. We show that TW Hya appears to be accreting material which
is significantly depleted in O relative to Ne. In constrast, BP Tau has an Ne/O
abundance ratio consistent with that observed for post-T Tauri stars. We
interpret this result in terms of the different ages and evolutionary states of
the circumstellar disks of these stars. In the young BP Tau disk (age 0.6 Myr)
dust is still present near the disk corotation radius and can be ionized and
accreted, re-releasing elements depleted onto grains. In the more evolved TW
Hya disk (age 10 Myr), evidence points to ongoing coagulation of grains into
much larger bodies, and possibly planets, that can resist the drag of
inward-migrating gas, and accreting gas is consequently depleted of
grain-forming elements.",2005-06-08T20:10:53Z
"Discovery of Rapid X-ray Oscillations in the Tail of the SGR 1806-20
  Hyperflare","We have discovered rapid Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in RXTE/PCA
measurements of the pulsating tail of the 27th December 2004 giant flare of SGR
1806-20. QPOs at about 92.5Hz are detected in a 50s interval starting 170s
after the onset of the giant flare. These QPOs appear to be associated with
increased emission by a relatively hard unpulsed component and are seen only
over phases of the 7.56s spin period pulsations away from the main peak. QPOs
at about 18 and 30Hz are also detected, 200-300s after the onset of the giant
flare. This is the first time that QPOs are unambiguously detected in the flux
of a Soft Gamma-ray Repeater, or any other magnetar candidate. We interpret the
highest QPOs in terms of the coupling of toroidal seismic modes with Alfven
waves propagating along magnetospheric field lines. The lowest frequency QPO
might instead provide indirect evidence on the strength of the internal
magnetic field of the neutron star.",2005-05-12T13:30:30Z
Spherical Collapse Model And Dark Energy(II),"This is a second paper of a series of two. In this paper, we directly correct
the problem pointed out in the first paper of this series, dark energy does not
cluster on the scale of galaxy clusters, but the current describing the flowing
of dark energies outside the clusters is ignored in almost all the previous
papers. We set up and solve a first order differential equation which describes
the evolution of the clusters in a back ground universe containing dark
energies.
  From the solution we extract the key parameters of the model and find them
depending on the equation of state coefficients of dark energies rather
non-trivially. We then apply the results in Press-Scheter theory and calculate
the number density of galaxy clusters and its evolutions, we find the
observable quantities are strongly affected by the equation of state
coefficients of dark energies.",2005-05-09T13:51:59Z

that the lower luminosity limit for maser emission is near 10^3 Lsun, by
comparison of the sources in our sample with previously detected methanol maser
sources. We examine the IRAS properties of our sample and compare them with
sources previously observed for methanol maser emission, almost all of which
satisfy the Wood & Churchwell criterion for selecting candidate UCHII regions.
We find that about half of our sample satisfy this criterion, and in addition
almost all of this subgroup have integrated fluxes between 25 and 60 microns
that are similar to sources with detectable methanol maser emission. By
identifying a number of low-mass protostars in this work and from the
literature that satisfy the Wood & Churchwell criterion for candidate UCHII
regions, we show conclusively for the first time that the fainter flux end of
their sample is contaminated by lower-mass non-ionizing sources, confirming the
suggestion by van der Walt and Ramesh & Sridharan.",2005-04-22T13:46:39Z
"The Century Survey Galactic Halo Project II: Global Properties and the
  Luminosity Function of Field Blue Horizontal Branch Stars","We discuss a 175 deg^2 spectroscopic survey for blue horizontal branch (BHB)
stars in the Galactic halo. We use the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to select BHB candidates, and find that the
2MASS and SDSS color-selection is 38% and 50% efficient, respectively, for BHB
stars. Our samples include one likely run-away B7 star 6 kpc below the Galactic
plane. The global properties of the BHB samples are consistent with membership
in the halo population: the median metallicity is [Fe/H]=-1.7, the velocity
dispersion is 108 km/s, and the mean Galactic rotation of the BHB stars
3<|z|<15 kpc is -4 +- 30 km/s. We discuss the theoretical basis of the Preston,
Shectman & Beers M_V-color relation for BHB stars, and conclude that intrinsic
shape of the BHB M_V-color relation results from the physics of stars on the
horizontal branch. We calculate the luminosity function for the field BHB star
samples using the Efstathiou, Ellis, & Peterson maximum-likelihood method which
is unbiased by density variations. The field BHB luminosity function exhibits a
steep rise at bright luminosities, a peak between 0.8 < M_V < 1.0, and a tail
at faint luminosities. We compare the field BHB luminosity functions with the
luminosity functions derived from sixteen different globular cluster BHBs.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests suggest that field BHB stars and BHB stars in globular
clusters share a common distribution of luminosities, with the exception of
globular clusters with extended BHBs.",2005-05-16T19:57:57Z
"Direct Measurements of Black Hole Charge with Future Astrometrical
  Missions","Recently, Zakharov et al. (2005) considered the possibility of evaluating the
spin parameter and the inclination angle for Kerr black holes in nearby
galactic centers by using future advanced astrometrical instruments. A similar
approach which uses the characteristic properties of gravitational
retro-lensing images can be followed to measure the charge of
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. Indeed, in spite of the fact that their
formation might be problematic, charged black holes are objects of intensive
investigations. From the theoretical point of view it is well-known that a
black hole is described by only three parameters, namely, its mass M, angular
momentum J and charge Q. Therefore, it would be important to have a method for
measuring all these parameters, preferably by model independent way. In this
paper, we propose a procedure to measure the black hole charge by using the
size of the retro-lensing images that can be revealed by future astrometrical
missions. A discussion of the Kerr-Newmann black hole case is also offered.",2005-05-13T15:35:57Z
"Chemical Composition of Two H II Regions in NGC 6822 Based on VLT
  Spectroscopy","We present long slit spectrophotometry of regions V and X of the local group
irregular galaxy NGC 6822. The data consist of VLT FORS observations in the
3450 to 7500 A range. We have obtained electron temperatures and densities
using different line intensity ratios. We have derived the He, C, and O
abundances relative to H based on recombination lines, the abundance ratios
among these elements are almost independent of the temperature structure of the
nebulae. We have also determined the N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar abundances based
on collisionally excited lines, the ratios of these abundances relative to that
of H depend strongly on the temperature structure of the nebulae. The chemical
composition of NGC 6822 V is compared with those of the Sun, the Orion nebula,
NGC 346 in the SMC, and 30 Doradus in the LMC. The O/H value derived from
recombination lines is in good agreement with the value derived by Venn et al.
(2001) from two A type supergiants in NGC 6822.",2005-07-04T23:18:44Z
SN 1998A: Explosion of a Blue Supergiant,"We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the peculiar Type II
supernova (SN) 1998A. The light curves and spectra closely resemble those of SN
1987A, suggesting that the SN 1998A progenitor exploded when it was a compact
blue supergiant. However, the comparison with SN 1987A also highlights some
important differences: SN 1998A is more luminous and the spectra show bluer
continua and larger expansion velocities at all epochs. These observational
properties indicate that the explosion of SN 1998A is more energetic than SN
1987A and more typical of SNe II. Comparing the observational data to
simulations, we deduce that the progenitor of SN 1998A was a massive star (~ 25
Mo) with a small pre-supernova radius (< 6 x 10^{12} cm). The Ba II lines,
unusually strong in SN 1987A and some faint II--P events, are almost normal in
the case of SN 1998A, indicating that the temperature plays a key role in
determining their strength.",2005-04-05T16:21:11Z
"Gamma-Ray Bursts and the Earth: Exploration of Atmospheric, Biological,
  Climatic and Biogeochemical Effects","Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are likely to have made a number of significant
impacts on the Earth during the last billion years. We have used a
two-dimensional atmospheric model to investigate the effects on the Earth's
atmosphere of GRBs delivering a range of fluences, at various latitudes, at the
equinoxes and solstices, and at different times of day. We have estimated DNA
damage levels caused by increased solar UVB radiation, reduction in solar
visible light due to $\mathrm{NO_2}$ opacity, and deposition of nitrates
through rainout of $\mathrm{HNO_3}$. For the ``typical'' nearest burst in the
last billion years, we find globally averaged ozone depletion up to 38%.
Localized depletion reaches as much as 74%. Significant global depletion (at
least 10%) persists up to about 7 years after the burst. Our results depend
strongly on time of year and latitude over which the burst occurs. We find DNA
damage of up to 16 times the normal annual global average, well above lethal
levels for simple life forms such as phytoplankton. The greatest damage occurs
at low to mid latitudes. We find reductions in visible sunlight of a few
percent, primarily in the polar regions. Nitrate deposition similar to or
slightly greater than that currently caused by lightning is also observed,
lasting several years. We discuss how these results support the hypothesis that
the Late Ordovician mass extinction may have been initiated by a GRB.",2005-05-23T13:14:53Z
"Long-Term Evolution of Supernova Remnants in Magnetized Interstellar
  Medium","The evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs) is studied, with particular
attention to the effect of magnetic fields with axisymmetric two-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical simulations. The evolution of magnetic SNRs is the same
as non-magnetic ones in the adiabatic Sedov stage. After a thin shell is
formed, the shell is driven by the pressure of the hot interior gas (bubble).
Evolution in the pressure-driven snow-plow phase is much affected by the
magnetic field. The shell sweeping the magnetic field lines thickens owing to
the magnetic pressure force. After $5\times 10^5{\rm yr}$ - $2\times 10^6{\rm
yr}$, the inner boundary of the thick shell begins to contract. This compresses
the hot bubble radially and maintains its thermal pressure. Thus, the bubble
forms a prolate spheroidal shape and becomes thinner and thinner, since it
expands in a direction parallel to the magnetic field for $B_0 \gtrsim 3\mu
{\rm G}$. Finally, the bubble contracts. The porosity of the hot low-density
gas in ISM is reduced, taking the effect of the magnetic field into account.",2005-07-19T19:31:51Z
"On the accuracy of slow-roll inflation given current observational
  constraints","We investigate the accuracy of slow-roll inflation in light of current
observational constraints, which do not allow for a large deviation from scale
invariance. We investigate the applicability of the first and second order
slow-roll approximations for inflationary models, including those with large
running of the scalar spectral index. We compare the full numerical solutions
with those given by the first and second order slow-roll formulae. We find that
even first order slow-roll is generally accurate; the largest deviations arise
in models with large running where the error in the power spectrum can be at
the level of 1-2%. Most of this error comes from inaccuracy in the calculation
of the slope and not of the running or higher order terms. Second order
slow-roll does not improve the accuracy over first order. We also argue that in
the basis $\epsilon_0=1/H$, $\epsilon_{n+1}={d\ln|\epsilon_n|}/{dN}$,
introduced by Schwarz et al. (2001), slow-roll does not require all of the
parameters to be small. For example, even a divergent $\epsilon_3$ leads to
finite solutions which are accurately described by a slow-roll approximation.
Finally, we argue that power spectrum parametrization recently introduced by
Abazaijan, Kadota and Stewart does not work for models where spectral index
changes from red to blue, while the usual Taylor expansion remains a good
approximation.",2005-06-14T20:27:18Z
"Observational evidence of the formation of cyanopolyynes in CRL618
  through the polimerization of HCN","The abundance ratio of consecutive members of the cyanopolyynes family has
been explored in CRL618 using data acquired in a complete line survey covering
the frequency range 81-356 GHz. The Jup range explored for the different
molecules is the following: 1 to 4 for HCN and HNC, 9 to 39 for HC3N, 31 to 133
for HC5N, and 72 to 85 for HC7N (not detected beyond Jup=85). The lowest
vibrationally excited state of HC7N (nu_15 at 62 cm^-1) has been tentatively
detected. Data analysis has been performed by extending our previous
geometrical and radiative transfer model of the slowly expanding envelope (SEE)
surrounding the compact central continuum source of CRL 618, that was
established from the study of rotational lines in several vibrationally excited
states of HC_3N. The new lines analyzed here require to model the high velocity
wind (HVW) component and the colder circumstellar gas, remnant of the AGB phase
of CRL618. The derived HC3N/HC5N and HC5N/HC7N abundance ratios from this set
of uniformly calibrated lines are between 3 and 6 in the different regions,
similar to standard values in the CSM and ISM, and consistent with previous
estimates obtained from ISO observations and chemical models. However, the
abundance ratios of HC3N, HC5N and HC7N with respect to HCN are at least two
orders of magnitude larger than those typical for AGB C-rich stars, such as
IRC+10216. This fact indicates that, in the short transition toward the
Planetary Nebula phase, HCN is quickly reprocessed into longer cyanopolyyne
chains. A similar behavior was previously found in this object for the
polyacetylenic chains (C(2n)H2).",2005-04-11T10:09:33Z
The temperature structure in the core of Sersic 159-03,"We present results from a new 120 ks XMM-Newton observation of the cluster of
galaxies Sersic 159-03. In this paper we focus on the high-resolution X-ray
spectra obtained with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS). The spectra
allow us to constrain the temperature structure in the core of the cluster and
determine the emission measure distribution as a function of temperature. We
also fit the line widths of mainly oxygen and iron lines.",2005-04-12T07:53:53Z
"An infrared study of galactic OH/IR stars. II. The `GLMP sample' of red
  oxygen-rich AGB stars","We present optical and near-infrared finding charts taken from the DSS and
2MASS surveys of 94 IRAS sources selected from the GLMP catalogue
(Garc\'{\i}a-Lario 1992), and accurate astrometry (~0.2"") for most of them.
Selection criteria were very red IRAS colours representative for OH/IR stars
with optically thick circumstellar shells and the presence of variability
according to the IRAS variability index (VAR>50). The main photometric
properties of the stars in this `GLMP sample' are presented, discussed and
compared with the correspondent properties of the `Arecibo sample' of OH/IR
stars studied in Jim\'enez-Esteban et al. (2005a). We find that 37% of the
sample (N=34) have no counterpart in the 2MASS, implying extremely high optical
depths of their shells. Most of the sources identified in the 2MASS are faint
(K>~8) and of very red colour in the near-infrared, as expected. The brightest
2MASS counterpart (K=5.3mag) was found for IRAS 18299--1705. Its blue colour
H--K=1.3 suggests that IRAS 8299--1705 is a post-AGB star. A couple of GLMP
sources have faint but relatively blue counterparts. They might be misidentifed
field stars or stars hich experienced recently a drop of their mass loss rates.
The `GLMP sample' in general is made of oxygen-rich AGB stars, which are highly
obscured by their circumstellar shells. They belong to the same population as
the reddest OH/IR stars in the `Arecibo sample'.",2005-08-03T18:56:30Z
The Fine Structure Lines of Hydrogen in HII Regions,"The 2s_{1/2} state of hydrogen is metastable and overpopulated in HII
regions. In addition, the 2p states may be pumped by ambient Lyman-alpha
radiation. Fine structure transitions between these states may be observable in
HII regions at 1.1 GHz (2s_{1/2}-2p_{1/2}) and/or 9.9 GHz (2s_{1/2}-2p_{3/2}),
although the details of absorption versus emission are determined by the
relative populations of the 2s and 2p states. The n=2 level populations are
solved with a parameterization that allows for Lyman-alpha pumping of the 2p
states. The density of Lyman-alpha photons is set by their creation rate,
easily determined from the recombination rate, and their removal rate. Here we
suggest that the dominant removal mechanism of Lyman-alpha radiation in HII
regions is absorption by dust. This circumvents the need to solve the
Lyman-alpha transfer problem, and provides an upper limit to the rate at which
the 2p states are populated by Lyman-alpha photons. In virtually all cases of
interest, the 2p states are predominantly populated by recombination, rather
than Lyman-alpha pumping. We then solve the radiative transfer problem for the
fine structure lines in the presence of free-free radiation. In the likely
absence of Lyman-alpha pumping, the 2s_{1/2}-2p_{1/2} lines will appear in
stimulated emission and the 2s_{1/2}-2p_{3/2} lines in absorption. Searching
for the 9.9 GHz lines in high emission measure HII regions offers the best
prospects for detection. The lines are predicted to be weak; in the best cases,
line-to-continuum ratios of several tenths of a percent might be expected with
line strengths of tens to a hundred mK with the Green Bank Telescope.",2005-05-21T00:53:42Z
"Formation of Galactic Systems in Light of the Magnesium Abundance in
  Field Stars: The Thick Disk","The space velocities and Galactic orbital elements of stars calculated from
the currently available high-accuracy observations in our summary catalog of
spectroscopic magnesium abundances in dwarfs and subgiants in the solar
neighborhood are used to identify thick-disk objects. The relative magnesium
abundances in thick-disk stars are shown to lie within the range
0.0<[Mg/Fe]<0.5 and to decrease with increasing metallicity starting from
[Fe/H]=-1.0. This is interpreted as evidence for a longer duration of the star
formation process in the thick disk. We have found vertical gradients in
metallicity (grad_Z[Fe/H]=-0.13\pm 0.04 kpc^{-1}) and relative magnesium
abundance (grad_Z [Mg/Fe]=0.06\pm 0.02 kpc^{-1}), which can be present in the
subsystem only in the case of its formation in a slowly collapsing protogalaxy.
The large spread in relative magnesium abundance (-0.3<[Mg/Fe]<0.5) in the
stars of the metal-poor ""tail"" of the thick disk which constitute 8% of the
subsystem, can be explained in terms of their formation inside isolated
interstellar clouds that interacted weakly with the matter of a single
protogalactic cloud. We have found a statistically significant negative radial
gradient in relative magnesium abundance in the thick disk (grad_R
[Mg/Fe]=-0.03\pm 0.01 kpc^{-1}) instead of the expected positive gradient. The
smaller perigalactic orbital radii and the higher eccentricities for
magnesium-richer stars, which among other stars, are currently located in a
small volume of the Galactic space near the Sun are assumed to be responsible
for the gradient inversion. A similar but statistically less significant
inversion is also observed in the subsystem for the radial metallicity
gradient.",2005-07-06T13:51:34Z
"Spiral galaxies with a central plateau in the gas velocity curve along
  the major axis","We present the minor-axis kinematics of ionized gas and stars for a sample of
5 spiral galaxies, which are characterized by either a zero or a shallow gas
velocity gradient along their major axis. The asymmetric velocity profiles
observed along the minor axis of NGC 4064 and NGC 4189 can be explained as due
to the presence of a bar. This is also the case of NGC 4178 where the innermost
portion of the gaseous disk is nearly face on. In NGC 4424 and NGC 4941, we
measured non-zero gas velocities only in the central regions along the minor
axis and gas velocities drop to zero at larger radii. This kinematic feature is
suggestive of the presence of an orthogonally-rotating gaseous component which
is confined in the innermost regions (i.e. an inner polar disk) to be confirmed
with integral-field spectroscopy.",2005-05-19T13:46:18Z
"Measuring the primordial power spectrum: Principal component analysis of
  the cosmic microwave background","We implement and investigate a method for measuring departures from
scale-invariance, both scale-dependent as well as scale-free, in the primordial
power spectrum of density perturbations using cosmic microwave background (CMB)
C_l data and a principal component analysis technique. The primordial power
spectrum is decomposed into a dominant scale-invariant Gaussian adiabatic
component plus a series of orthonormal modes whose detailed form only depends
the noise model for a particular CMB experiment. However, in general these
modes are localised across wavenumbers with 0.01 < k < 0.2 Mpc^-1, displaying
rapid oscillations on scales corresponding the acoustic peaks where the
sensitivity to primordial power spectrum is greatest. The performance of this
method is assessed using simulated data for the Planck satellite, and the full
cosmological plus power spectrum parameter space is integrated out using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo. As a proof of concept we apply this data compression
technique to the current CMB data from WMAP, ACBAR, CBI and VSA. We find no
evidence for the breaking of scale-invariance from measurements of four PCA
mode amplitudes, which is translated to a constraint on the scalar spectral
index n_S(k_0=0.04 Mpc^-1)=0.94+-0.04 in accordance with WMAP studies.",2005-06-16T17:48:08Z
The colours of Virgo dEs as seen by SDSS,"A colour analysis of a carefully selected sample of over 200 Virgo cluster
dEs and 8 giant ellipticals (Es) in the SDSS yields the following results: a)
the nucleated dEs (dENs) follow a tight colour-magnitude relation (CMR) which
does not broaden significantly at fainter (Mr > -15) magnitudes, b) the CMR of
dENs smoothly transitions to the CMR of Es, but the latter changes its slope at
about Mr = -20, c) the brighter dENs are consistent with ages of t > 5Gyr and a
decrease of metallicity towards fainter magnitudes, but a possible additional
luminosity-age relation is not ruled out, d) it is crucial to treat dS0s
separately from dEs since their different colour properties would otherwise
bias the comparison of nucleated and non-nucleated dEs (dEnoNs), e) the dEnoNs
show a weak trend towards bluer colours than dENs.",2005-05-03T05:13:16Z
GRB environment properties through X and optical afterglow observations,"We present the spectral analysis of 14 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) X-ray
afterglows in order to investigate the properties of interstellar matter (ISM)
along the line of sight of GRB. We carried out a simultaneous analysis of the
NIR-optical and X-band for those afterglows with an optical counterpart too, in
order to evaluate and strongly constrain the absorption effect on the spectral
energy distribution due to dust extinction from GRB environment. We evaluated
the equivalent hydrogen column density Nh from X-ray spectroscopy and rest
frame visual extinction Av by assuming different type of ISM composition and
dust grain size distribution. From our analysis we obtained a distribution of
the GRB rest frame consistent with the one expected if GRB were embedded in a
Galactic-like molecular cloud. Moreover, values of the visual extinction
estimated from the simultaneous analysis of NIR-to-X band favour an environment
where small dust grain are destroyed by the interaction with the X-ray and UV
photons from GRB.",2005-06-20T09:19:53Z
Scaling Dark Energy in a Five-Dimensional Bouncing Cosmological Model,"We consider a 5-dimensional Ricci flat bouncing cosmological model in which
the 4-dimensional induced matter contains two components at late times - the
cold dark matter (CDM)+baryons and dark energy. We find that the arbitrary
function $f(z)$ contained in the solution plays a similar role as the potential
$V(\phi)$ in quintessence and phantom dark energy models. To resolve the
coincidence problem, it is generally believed that there is a scaling stage in
the evolution of the universe. We analyze the condition for this stage and show
that a hyperbolic form of the function $f(z)$ can work well in this property.
We find that during the scaling stage (before $z\approx 2$), the dark energy
behaves like (but not identical to) a cold dark matter with an adiabatic sound
speed $c_{s}^{2}\approx 0$ and $p_{x}\approx 0$. After $z\approx 2$, the
pressure of dark energy becomes negative. The transition from deceleration to
acceleration happens at $z_{T}\approx 0.8$ which, as well as other predictions
of the $5D$ model, agree with current observations.",2005-07-11T12:36:40Z
Line bisectors and radial velocity jitter from SARG spectra,"We present an analysis of spectral line bisector variations for a few stars
observed in the SARG high precision radial velocity planet survey, and discuss
their relationship with differential radial velocities. The spectra we consider
are the same used for determining radial velocities. The iodine cell lines
employed in the measurement of radial velocities were removed before bisector
analysis. The line bisectors were then computed from average absorption
profiles obtained by cross correlation of the stellar spectra with a mask made
from suitable lines of a solar catalog. Bisector velocity spans were then
determined: errors in these quantities compare well with theoretical
expectations based on resolution, S/N and line shape. The plot of bisector
velocity span against radial velocity was studied to search for correlations
between line asymmetries and radial velocity variations. A correlation was seen
for HD 166435 due to stellar activity, and for HD 8071B due to spectral
contamination by the companion. No correlation was seen for 51 Peg and rho CrB,
stars hosting planets. We conclude that this technique may be useful to
separate radial velocity variations due to barycenter motion from spurious
signals in spectra acquired with the iodine cell.",2005-08-03T07:57:42Z
"HS 2134+0400 - new very metal-poor galaxy, a representative of void
  population?","We present the SAO 6m telescope spectroscopy of a blue compact galaxy (BCG)
HS 2134+0400 discovered in frame of the dedicated Hamburg/SAO survey for Low
Metallicity BCGs (HSS-LM). Its very low abundance of oxygen (12+log(O/H) =
7.44), as well as other heavy elements (S, N, Ne, Ar), assigns this dwarf
galaxy to the group of BCGs with the lowest metal content. There are only eight
that low metallicity among several thousand known BCGs in the nearby Universe.
The abundance ratios for the heavy elements (S/O, Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O) are well
consistent with the typical values of other very metal-poor BCGs. The global
environment of HS 2134+0400 is atypical of the majority of BCGs. The object
falls within the Pegasus void, the large volume with the very low density of
galaxies with the normal (M_B* = -19.6) or high luminosity. Since we found in
voids a dozen more the very metal-poor galaxies, we discuss the hypothesis that
such objects can be representative of a substantial fraction of the void dwarf
galaxy population.",2005-08-11T08:07:29Z
"Red giant branch stars as probes of stellar populations. II. Properties
  of the newly discovered globular cluster GLIMPSE-C01","Deep near infrared photometry of the newly discovered Galactic globular
Cluster GLIMPSE-C01 is reported. We derived for the first time the metal
abundance of this object from the slope of the RGB: [Fe/H]=-1.61+/-0.14 in the
scale of Zinn (as implemented in Harris 1996), [Fe/H]=-1.44+/-0.12 in the scale
of Caretta & Gratton (1997), and [Fe/H]=-1.12+/-0.12 in the scale of Ferraro et
al. (1999). The tip and the clump of the red giant branch were used to confirm
the estimates of Kobulnicky et al. (2005), placing the cluster at D~3.7+/-0.8
kpc, behind A_v~15 mag of visual extinction. The best fit to the radial surface
brightness profile with a single-mass King's model (1962) yielded core radius
r_c=0.78 arcmin, tidal radius r_t=27 arcmin, and central concentration c=1.54.
  Finally, we estimate the number of the ""missing"" globulars in the central
region of the Milky Way. Based on the spatial distribution of the known
clusters, and assuming radial symmetry around the Galactic center, we conclude
that the Milky Way contains at least 10+/-3 undiscovered objects. The
distribution of known clusters in the bulge seem to resemble the orientation of
the Milky Way bar.",2005-06-01T19:02:44Z
High-Resolution Spectroscopy of Ursa Major Moving Group Stars,"We use new and extant literature spectroscopy to address abundances and
membership for UMa moving group stars. We first compare the UMa, Coma, and
Hyades H-R diagrams via a homogeneous set of isochrones, and find that these
three aggregates are essentially coeval. Our spectroscopy of cool UMa dwarfs
reveals striking abundance anomalies--trends with Teff, ionization state, and
excitation potential--like those recently seen in young cool M34, Pleaides, and
Hyades dwarfs. In particular, the trend of rising 7774 Ang-based OI abundance
with declining Teff is markedly subdued in UMa compared to the Pleiades,
suggesting a dependence on age or metallicity. Despite disparate sources of Li
data,our homogeneous analysis indicates that UMa members evince remarkably
small scatter in the Li-Teff plane for Teff>5200 K. Significant star-to-star
scatter suggested by previous studies is seen for cooler stars. Comparison with
the consistently determined Hyades Li-Teff trend reveals differences
qualitatively consistent with this cluster's larger [Fe/H] (and perhaps
slightly larger age). However, quantitative comparison with standard stellar
models indicates the differences are smaller than expected, suggesting the
action of a fourth parameter beyond age, mass, and [Fe/H] controlling Li
depletion.",2005-07-29T19:58:47Z
"The Linearity of the Wesenheit function for the Large Magellanic Cloud
  Cepheids","There is strong evidence that the period-luminosity (PL) relation for the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids shows a break at a period around 10 days.
Since the LMC PL relation is extensively used in distance scale studies, the
non-linearity of the LMC PL relation may affect the results based on this LMC
calibrated relation. In this paper we show that this problem can be remedied by
using the Wesenheit function in obtaining Cepheid distances. This is because
the Wesenheit function is linear although recent data suggests that the PL and
the period-colour (PC) relations that make up the Wesenheit function are not.
We test the linearity of the Wesenheit function and find strong evidence that
the LMC Wesenheit function is indeed linear. This is because the non-linearity
of the PL and PC relations cancel out when the Wesenheit function is
constructed. We discuss this result in the context of distance scale
applications. We also compare the distance moduli obtained from
mu_0=mu_V-R(mu_V-mu_I) (equivalent to Wesenheit functions) constructed with the
linear and the broken LMC PL relations, and find that the typical difference in
distance moduli is ~ +-0.03mag. Hence, the broken LMC PL relation does not
seriously affect current distance scale applications. We also discuss the
random error calculated with equation mu_0=mu_V-R(mu_V-mu_I), and show that
there is a correlation term that exists from the calculation of the random
error. The calculated random error will be larger if this correlation term is
ignored.",2005-04-08T15:28:32Z
Comments on the proposal of Dark Energy Stars by Chapline,"We point out that the contentions of Chapline (astro-ph/0503200)[1] that (i)
General Relativity (GR) is in conflict with Quantum Mechanics (QM) and (ii) GR
fails even on macroscopic length scales are incorrect and based on (i)
misunderstanding of GR and (ii) completely misconceived ``thought
experiments''. Even without introduction of any QM, GR actually does not allow
formation of any Event Horizon and is competent to figure out the actual nature
of the supposed Black Hole candidates. The resultant picture is not in conflict
with QM at all.",2005-04-18T12:57:09Z
2-D and 3-D Radiation Transfer Models of High-Mass Star Formation,"2-D and 3-D radiation transfer models of forming stars generally produce
bluer 1-10 micron colors than 1-D models of the same evolutionary state and
envelope mass. Therefore, 1-D models of the shortwave radiation will generally
estimate a lower envelope mass and later evolutionary state than
multidimensional models. 1-D models are probably reasonable for very young
sources, or longwave analysis (wavelengths > 100 microns). In our 3-D models of
high-mass stars in clumpy molecular clouds, we find no correlation between the
depth of the 10 micron silicate feature and the longwave (> 100 micron) SED
(which sets the envelope mass), even when the average optical extinction of the
envelope is >100 magnitudes. This is in agreement with the observations of
Faison et al. (1998) of several UltraCompact HII (UCHII) regions, suggesting
that many of these sources are more evolved than embedded protostars.
  We have calculated a large grid of 2-D models and find substantial overlap
between different evolutionary states in the mid-IR color-color diagrams. We
have developed a model fitter to work in conjunction with the grid to analyze
large datasets. This grid and fitter will be expanded and tested in 2005 and
released to the public in 2006.",2005-06-23T02:43:41Z
"High Energy Afterglow Emission from Giant Flares of Soft Gamma-Ray
  Repeaters: The Case of the 2004 December 27 Event from SGR 1806-20","We discuss the high enegry afterglow emission (including high energy photons,
neutrinos and cosmic rays) following the 2004 December 27 Giant Flare from SGR
1806-20. If the initial outflow is relativistic with a bulk Lorentz factor
\Gamma_0\sim {\rm tens}, the high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission from
electrons in the forward shock region gives rise to a prominent sub-GeV
emission, if the electron spectrum is hard enough and if the intial Lorentz
factor is high enough. This signal could serve as a diagnosis of the initial
Lorentz factor of the giant flare outflow. This component is potentially
detectable by GLAST if a similar giant flare occurs in the GLAST era. With the
available 10 MeV data, we constrain that \Gamma_0 < 50 if the electron
distribution is a single power law. For a broken power law distribution of
electrons, a higher \Gamma_0 is allowed. At energies higher than 1 GeV, the
flux is lower because of a high energy cut off of the synchrotron emission
component. The synchrotron self-Compton emission component and the inverse
Compton scattering component off the photons in the giant flare oscillation
tail are also considered, but they are found not significant given a moderate
\Gamma_0 (e.g. \leq 10). The forward shock also accelerates cosmic rays to the
maximum energy 10^{17}eV, and generate neutrinos with a typical energy
10^{14}eV through photomeson interaction with the X-ray tail photons. However,
they are too weak to be detectable.",2005-05-23T20:47:51Z
"X-Ray Flares of Sun-Like Young Stellar Objects and Their Effects on
  Protoplanetary Disks","Astronomical observations of flares from analogs of the early Sun have the
potential to give critical insights into the high energy irradiation
environment of protoplanetary disks. Solar-mass young stellar objects are
significantly more X-ray luminous than the typical low-mass T Tauri star. They
undergo frequent strong flaring on a several day time scale. Very powerful
flares also occur, but on a longer time frame. The hard X-ray spectrum of these
stars become even harder during flaring. The X-rays from these sun-like young
stellar objects have the potential to ionize circumstellar material out to
large distances. Three specific illustrations are given of the effects of the
X-rays: The physics and chemistry of the atmospheres of the inner accretion
disks; the ionization level at the disk midplane, important for the viability
of the magnetorotational instability; and the nuclear fluence in the
irradiation zone just interior to the inner edge of the disk, important in
local irradiation scenarios for producing the short-lived radionuclides found
in meteorites.",2005-05-27T17:12:52Z
The lives and deaths of positrons in the interstellar medium,"We reexamine in detail the various processes undergone by positrons in the
ISM from their birth to their annihilation using the most recent results of
positron interaction cross sections with H, H2 and He. The positrons' lives are
divided into two phases: the 'in-flight' phase and the thermal phase. The first
phase is treated with a Monte Carlo simulation that allows us to determine the
fraction of positrons that form positronium and annihilate as well as the
characteristics of the annihilation emission as a function of the medium
conditions. The second phase is treated with a binary reaction rate approach,
with cross sections adopted from experimental measurement or theoretical
calculations. An extensive search and update of the knowledge of positron
processes was thus undertaken. New reaction rates and line widths have been
obtained. We investigate the treatment of the complicated interactions between
positrons and interstellar dust grains. New reaction rates and widths of the
line resulting from the annihilation inside and outside of the grain have been
obtained. The final results of our calculations showed that dust is only
important in the hot phase of the ISM, where it dominates all other processes.
Combining the new calculations, we have constructed annihilation spectra for
each phase of the ISM, considering various grain contents, as well as an
overall combined spectrum for the ISM as a whole.",2005-04-07T18:37:05Z
Extinction Correction for Type Ia Supernova Rates. I. The Model,"In this paper we present and discuss a new Monte Carlo approach aimed at
correcting the observed Supernova (SN) rates for the effects of host galaxy
dust extinction. The problem is addressed in a general way and the model
includes SN position distributions, SN light curve and spectral library, dust
properties and distribution as input ingredients. Even though the recipe we
propose is in principle applicable to all SN types, in this paper we illustrate
the use of our model only for Type Ia. These represent in fact the simplest
test case, basically due to their spectroscopic homogeneity which, to a first
approximation, allows one to treat them all in the same way. This test case
shows that the final results do not depend critically on the spiral arm dust
geometry, while the total amount of dust, its properties and the size of the
galactic bulge do have a strong effect. With the availability of more complete
spectral libraries and a more accurate knowledge of SN spatial distribution,
the method we propose here can be easily extended to Core Collapses events.",2005-06-28T07:03:08Z
Fitting Non-Minimally Coupled Scalar Models to Gold SnIa Dataset,"Non-minimally coupled theories of special potentials are analyzed
numerically. Such theories yield equations of state $\omega<-1$ and
oscillations of the cosmological expansion, which are favored by the recent
analysis of observations. Fitting these theories to the Gold SnIa dataset, we
obtain results comparable with other models. A potential of the form
$V(\phi)=V_0e^{a_1\phi^2}$ yields $\chi^2_{min}=170.127$. Similar results are
obtained for potentials of the form $V(\phi)=V_0+a_1\phi^n$.",2005-06-04T08:32:20Z
CMB Anisotropy Due to Tangled magnetic fields in re-ionized models,"Primordial tangled cosmological Magnetic Fields source rotational velocity
perturbations of the baryon fluid, even in the post-recombination universe.
These vortical modes inturn leave a characteristic imprint on the temperature
anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), if the CMB photons can be
re-scatterred after recombination. Observations from WMAP indicate that the
Universe underwent a relatively early re-ionization ($z_{ri} \sim 15$), which
does indeed lead to a significant optical depth for re-scattering of CMB
photons after the re-ionization epoch. We compute the resulting additional
temperature anisotropies, induced by primordial magnetic fields in the
post-recombination universe. We show that in models with early re-ionization, a
nearly scale-invariant spectrum of tangled magnetic fields which redshift to a
present value of $B_0 \sim 3 \times 10^{-9}$ Gauss, produce vector mode
perturbations which in turn induce additional temperature anisotropy of about
0.3 to 0.4 $ \mu$K over very small angular scales, with $ l$ upto $\sim 10000 $
or so.",2005-04-01T02:05:44Z
"Spatial fluctuations in the spectral shape of the UV background at 2<z<3
  and the reionization of helium","The low density hydrogen and helium in the IGM probed by QSO absorption lines
is sensitive to the amplitude and spectral shape of the metagalactic UV
background. We use realistic HI and HeII Ly-alpha forest spectra, constructed
from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of a Lambda-CDM Universe, to
confirm the reliability of using line profile fitting techniques to infer the
ratio of the metagalactic HI and HeII ionization rates. We further show that
the large spatial variations and the anti-correlation with HI absorber density
observed in the ratio of the measured HeII to HI column densities can be
explained in a model where the HI ionization rate is dominated by the combined
UV emission from young star forming galaxies and QSOs and the HeII ionization
rate is dominated by emission from QSOs only. In such a model the large
fluctuations in the column density ratio are due to the small number of QSOs
expected to contribute at any given point to the HeII ionization rate. A
significant contribution to UV emission at the HeII photoelectric edge from hot
gas in galaxies and galaxy groups would decrease the expected fluctuations in
the column density ratio. Consequently, this model appears difficult to
reconcile with the large increase in HeII opacity fluctuations towards higher
redshift. Our results further strengthen previous suggestions that observed
HeII Ly-alpha forest spectra at z~2-3.5 probe the tail end of the reionization
of HeII by QSOs.",2005-08-09T11:02:18Z
Fitting Photometry of Blended Microlensing Events,"We reexamine the usefulness of fitting blended lightcurve models to
microlensing photometric data. We find agreement with previous workers (e.g.
Wozniak & Paczynski) that this is a difficult proposition because of the
degeneracy of blend fraction with other fit parameters. We show that follow-up
observations at specific point along the lightcurve (peak region and wings) of
high magnification events are the most helpful in removing degeneracies. We
also show that very small errors in the baseline magnitude can result in
problems in measuring the blend fraction, and study the importance of
non-Gaussian errors in the fit results. The biases and skewness in the
distribution of the recovered blend fraction is discussed. We also find a new
approximation formula relating the blend fraction and the unblended fit
parameters to the underlying event duration needed to estimate microlensing
optical depth.",2005-07-08T19:10:22Z
"Radio Observations of the Hubble Deep Field South region: I. Survey
  Description and Initial Results","This paper is the first of a series describing the results of the Australia
Telescope Hubble Deep Field South (ATHDFS) radio survey. The survey was
conducted at four wavelengths - 20, 11, 6, and 3 cm, over a 4-year period, and
achieves an rms sensitivity of about 10 microJy at each wavelength. We describe
the observations and data reduction processes, and present data on radio
sources close to the centre of the HDF-S. We discuss in detail the properties
of a subset of these sources. The sources include both starburst galaxies and
galaxies powered by an active galactic nucleus, and range in redshift from 0.1
to 2.2. Some of them are characterised by unusually high radio-to-optical
luminosities, presumably caused by dust extinction.",2005-05-11T03:02:30Z
Kuiper Binary Object Formation,"It has been observed that binary Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) exist contrary to
theoretical expectations. Their creation presents problems to most current
models. However, the inclusion of a third body (for example, one of the outer
planets) may provide the conditions necessary for the formation of these
objects. The presence of a third massive body not only helps to clear the
primordial Kuiper Belt but can also result in long lived binary Kuiper belt
objects. The gravitational interaction between the KBOs and the third body
causes one of four effects; scattering into the Oort cloud, collisions with the
growing protoplanets, formation of binary pairs, or creation of a single Kuiper
belt object. Additionally, the initial location of the progenitors of the
Kuiper belt objects also has a significant effect on binary formation.",2005-07-06T20:27:22Z
The luminous host galaxies of high redshift BL Lac objects,"(abridged) We present near-infrared Ks-band imaging of 13 high redshift (0.6
< z < 1.3) BL Lac objects. We clearly detect the host in eight objects, and
marginally in three others. In all cases, the host galaxy is well represented
by an r^1/4 surface brightness law. The host galaxies of high redshift BL Lacs
are large (<R(e)> ~7 kpc) and very luminous (<M(K)> = -27.9+-0.7), ~3 mag
brighter than L*, and ~1 mag brighter than brightest cluster galaxies. They are
also ~1 mag brighter than low redshift radio galaxies and appear to deviate
from their K-z relationship. On the other hand, the high luminosities agree
with the few optical studies of high redshift BL Lac hosts. The nuclear
luminosity and the nucleus-galaxy luminosity ratio of the high redshift BL Lacs
are much larger than those in low redshift BL Lacs. This may be due to either a
higher intrinsic nuclear luminosity, or enhanced luminosity because of strong
beaming. Contrary to what is observed in low redshift BL Lacs, the luminosities
of the host galaxy and of the nucleus are fairly well correlated, as expected
from the black hole mass - bulge luminosity relationship. High redshift BL Lacs
radiate with a wide range of power with respect to their Eddington luminosity,
and this power is intermediate between those in nearby BL Lacs and in luminous
radio-loud quasars. The high redshift BL Lac host galaxies appear to be ~2 mag
brighter than those at low redshift. This is likely due to a strong selection
effect in the surveys of BL Lacs that makes observable only the most luminous
sources at z > 0.5 and produces a correlation between the nuclear and the host
luminosity. However, this may also suggest strong luminosity evolution which is
inconsistent with a simple passive evolution of the host galaxies, and requires
a contribution from relatively recent star formation episodes.",2005-05-20T14:57:21Z
"Chandra HETGS Multi-Phase Spectroscopy of the Young Magnetic O Star
  theta^1 Orionis C","We report on four Chandra grating observations of the oblique magnetic
rotator theta^1 Ori C (O5.5 V) covering a wide range of viewing angles with
respect to the star's 1060 G dipole magnetic field. We employ line-width and
centroid analyses to study the dynamics of the X-ray emitting plasma in the
circumstellar environment, as well as line-ratio diagnostics to constrain the
spatial location, and global spectral modeling to constrain the temperature
distribution and abundances of the very hot plasma. We investigate these
diagnostics as a function of viewing angle and analyze them in conjunction with
new MHD simulations of the magnetically channeled wind shock mechanism on
theta^1 Ori C. This model fits all the data surprisingly well, predicting the
temperature, luminosity, and occultation of the X-ray emitting plasma with
rotation phase.",2005-04-13T14:03:15Z
Thermal Evolution of Supernova Iron in Elliptical Galaxies,"In explaining the relative metal abundances observed in galaxy groups and
clusters, it is generally assumed that all metals created by supernovae are
present either in visible stars or the hot gas. We discuss here the possibility
that some of the iron expelled into the hot gas by Type Ia supernovae may have
radiatively cooled, avoiding detection by X-ray and optical observers.
Hydrodynamic models of Type Ia explosions in the hot gas inside elliptical
galaxies result in a gas of nearly pure iron that is several times hotter than
the local interstellar gas. We describe the subsequent thermal evolution of the
iron-rich gas as it radiates and thermally mixes with the surrounding gas.
There is a critical time by which the iron ions must mix into the ambient gas
to avoid rapid radiative cooling. We find that successful mixing is possible if
the iron ions diffuse with large mean free paths, as in an unmagnetized plasma.
However, in microgauss fields the Larmor radii of the iron ions are
exceptionally small, so the field geometry must be highly tangled or radial to
allow the iron to mix by diffusion faster than it cools by radiative losses.
The possibility that some of the supernova iron cools cannot be easily
discounted.",2005-05-26T09:34:21Z
Sunyaev-Zeldovich Cluster Counts as a Probe of Intra-Supercluster Gas,"X-ray background surveys indicate the likely presence of diffuse warm gas in
the Local Super Cluster (LSC), in accord with expectations from hydrodynamical
simulations. We assess several other manifestations of warm LSC gas; these
include anisotropy in the spatial pattern of cluster Sunyaev-Zeldovich (S-Z)
counts, its impact on the CMB temperature power spectrum at the lowest
multipoles, and implications on measurements of the S-Z effect in and around
the Virgo cluster.",2005-07-21T11:16:31Z
Stellar Photometry and Astrometry with Discrete Point Spread Functions,"The key features of the MATPHOT algorithm for precise and accurate stellar
photometry and astrometry using discrete Point Spread Functions are described.
A discrete Point Spread Function (PSF) is a sampled version of a continuous PSF
which describes the two-dimensional probability distribution of photons from a
point source (star) just above the detector. The shape information about the
photon scattering pattern of a discrete PSF is typically encoded using a
numerical table (matrix) or a FITS image file. Discrete PSFs are shifted within
an observational model using a 21-pixel-wide damped sinc function and position
partial derivatives are computed using a five-point numerical differentiation
formula. Precise and accurate stellar photometry and astrometry is achieved
with undersampled CCD observations by using supersampled discrete PSFs that are
sampled 2, 3, or more times more finely than the observational data. The
precision and accuracy of the MATPHOT algorithm is demonstrated by using the
C-language MPD code to analyze simulated CCD stellar observations; measured
performance is compared with a theoretical performance model. Detailed analysis
of simulated Next Generation Space Telescope observations demonstrate that
millipixel relative astrometry and millimag photometric precision is achievable
with complicated space-based discrete PSFs. For further information about
MATPHOT and MPD, including source code and documentation, see

Towards an Empirical Determination of the ZZ Ceti Instability Strip,"We present atmospheric parameters for a large sample of DA white dwarfs that
are known to be photometrically constant. For each star, we determine the
effective temperature and surface gravity by comparing high signal-to-noise
ratio optical spectra to the predictions of detailed model atmosphere
calculations. We also report the successful prediction and detection of
photometric variability in G232-38 based on similar Teff and log g
determinations. The atmospheric parameters derived for this sample of constant
stars as well as those for the known sample of bright ZZ Ceti stars (now
boosted to a total of 39) have been obtained in a highly homogeneous way. We
combine them to study the empirical red and blue edges as well as the purity of
the ZZ Ceti instability strip. We find that the red edge is rather well
constrained whereas there exists a rather large range of possibilities for the
slope of the blue edge. Furthermore, the ZZ Ceti instability strip that results
from our analysis contains no nonvariable white dwarfs. Our sample of constant
stars is part of a much broader spectroscopic survey of bright (V < 17) DA
white dwarfs, which we have recently undertaken. We also present here some
preliminary results of this survey. Finally, we revisit the analysis by Mukadam
et al. of the variable and nonvariable DA stars uncovered as part of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. Their erroneous conclusion of an instability strip
containing several nonvariable stars is traced back to the low signal-to-noise
ratio spectroscopic observations used in that survey.",2005-06-20T12:01:32Z
The recurrent ultra-luminous X-ray transient NGC 253 ULX1,"We present the results of ROSAT and XMM-Newton observations of the recurrent
ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 253 ULX1. This transient is one of the few
ULXs that was detected during several outbursts. The luminosity reached 1.4
10^39 erg s^-1 and 0.5 10^39 erg s^-1 in the detections by ROSAT and
XMM-Newton, respectively, indicating a black hole X-ray binary with a mass of
the compact object of >11 M_sun. It is highly unlikely that this source is a
foreground source or a background AGN. In the ROSAT detection NGC 253 ULX1
showed significant variability, whereas the luminosity was constant in the
detection from XMM-Newton. The XMM-Newton EPIC spectra are well-fit by a
bremsstrahlung model (kT=2.24 keV, N_H=1.74 10^20 cm^-2), which can be used to
describe a comptonized plasma. No counterpart was detected in the optical I, R,
B, NUV and FUV bands to limits of 22.9, 24.2, 24.3, 22 and 23 mag,
respectively, pointing at a X-ray binary with a low mass companion.",2005-07-11T11:42:50Z
Dark Matter Haloes and Rotation Curves via Brans-Dicke Theory,"In the present work, the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of gravity is taken as a
possible theory of k-essence. Then starting with the (already known)
Brans-Dicke-Schwarzschild solution which can represent the gravitationally
bound static configurations of the BD scalar k-essence, issues like whether
these configurations can reproduce the observed properties of galactic dark
matter haloes have been addressed. It has been realized that indeed the BD
scalar k-essence can cluster into dark matter halo-like objects with flattened
rotation curves while exhibiting a dark energy-like negative pressure on larger
scales.",2005-07-18T12:42:03Z
The Chemical Composition of Local Group Dwarf Spheroidals,"I will review the progress of VLT spectroscopy of large numbers of individual

"An Infalling Torus of Molecular Gas Around the Ultra-Compact HII Region
  G28.20-0.05","We present new observations of the ultra-compact HII region G28.20-0.05 in 23
GHz continuum, and the NH3(1,1), NH3(2.2), and NH3(3,3) lines. To explain the
complicated kinematics of the molecular gas, we propose a model consisting of
two components. One component is an infalling, equatorial torus of molecular
gas, whose dense central region has been ionized to form the ultra-compact HII
region. The second component is a larger expanding molecular shell driven by
some type of wide-angle outflow or wind. We estimate that the infall component
includes more than 18 Msun of molecular gas. We calculate the central mass to
be 79 Msun, probably comprising more than one star. The arrangement of the
molecular material suggests a connection to the other disk-like structures seen
around massive young stars. The central star in this case is more massive, and
the whole region may be more evolved than other similar objects such as IRAS
20126+4104, IRAS 18089-1732, G192.16-3.84, and AFGL5142.",2005-06-02T14:32:25Z
"Spectroscopic Confirmation of Multiple Red Galaxy-Galaxy Mergers in
  MS1054-03 (z=0.83)","We present follow-up spectroscopy of the galaxy cluster MS1054-03 (z=0.83)
confirming that at least six of the nine merging galaxy pairs identified by van
Dokkum et al. (1999) are indeed bound systems: they have projected separations
of R_s<10 kpc and relative line-of sight velocities of dv<165 km/s. For the
remaining three pairs, we were unable to obtain redshifts of both constituent
galaxies. To identify a more objective sample of merging systems, we select
bound red galaxy pairs (R_s<=30 kpc, dv<=300 km/s) from our sample of 121
confirmed cluster members: galaxies in bound red pairs make up 15.7+/-3.6% of
the cluster population. The (B-K_s) color-magnitude diagram shows that the pair
galaxies are as red as the E/S0 members and have a homogeneous stellar
population. The red pair galaxies span a large range in luminosity and internal
velocity dispersion to include some of the brightest, most massive members
(L>L*, sigma>200 km/s); these bound galaxy pairs must evolve into E/S0 members
by z~0.7. These results combined with MS1054's high merger fraction and
reservoir of likely future mergers indicates that most, if not all, of its
early-type members evolved from (passive) galaxy-galaxy mergers at z<~1.",2005-05-17T19:24:44Z
"Photospheric phosphorus in the FUSE spectra of GD71 and two similar DA
  white dwarfs","We report the detection, from FUSE data, of phosphorus in the atmospheres of
GD71 and two similar DA white dwarfs. This is the first detection of a trace
metal in the photosphere of the spectrophotometric standard star GD71.
Collectively, these objects represent the coolest DA white dwarfs in which
photospheric phosphorus has been observed. We use a grid of homogeneous non-LTE
synthetic spectra to measure abundances of[P/H]=-8.57 +0.09 -0.13, -8.70 +0.23
-0.37 and -8.36 +0.14 -0.19 in GD71, RE J1918+595 and RE J0605-482
respectively. At the observed level we find phosphorus has no significant
impact on the overall energy distribution of GD71. We explore possible
mechanisms responsible for the presence of this element in these stars,
concluding that the most likely is an interplay between radiative levitation
and gravitational settling but possibly modified by weak mass loss.",2005-07-27T14:38:42Z
"Lorentz violation at high energy: concepts, phenomena and astrophysical
  constraints","We consider here the possibility of quantum gravity induced violation of
Lorentz symmetry (LV). Even if suppressed by the inverse Planck mass such LV
can be tested by current experiments and astrophysical observations. We review
the effective field theory approach to describing LV, the issue of naturalness,
and many phenomena characteristic of LV. We discuss some of the current
observational bounds on LV, focusing mostly on those from high energy
astrophysics in the QED sector at order E/M_Planck. In this context we present
a number of new results which include the explicit computation of rates of the
most relevant LV processes, the derivation of a new photon decay constraint,
and modification of previous constraints taking proper account of the helicity
dependence of the LV parameters implied by effective field theory.",2005-05-12T19:55:28Z
Mid-infrared spectra of PAH emission in Herbig AeBe stars,"We present spectra of four Herbig AeBe stars obtained with the Infrared
Spectrograph (IRS). on the Spitzer Space Telescope. All four of the sources
show strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with the 6.2
um emission feature shifted to 6.3 um and the strongest C-C skeletal-mode
feature occuring at 7.9 um instead of at 7.7 um as is often seen. Remarkably,
none of the four stars have silicate emission. The strength of the 7.9 um
feature varies with respect to the 11.3 um feature among the sources,
indicating that we have observed PAHs with a range of ionization fractions. The
ionization fraction is higher for systems with hotter and brighter central
stars. Two sources, HD 34282 and HD 169142, show emission features from
aliphatic hydrocarbons at 6.85 and 7.25 um. The spectrum of HD 141569 shows a
previously undetected emission feature at 12.4 um which may be related to the
12.7 um PAH feature. The spectrum of HD 135344, the coolest star in our sample,
shows an unusual profile in the 7-9 um region, with the peak emission to the
red of 8.0 um and no 8.6 um PAH feature.",2005-06-28T18:46:50Z
"Tracking Dark Energy with the ISW effect: short and long-term
  predictions","We present an analysis of the constraining power of future measurements of
the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect on models of the equation of state of
dark energy as a function of redshift, w(z). To achieve this, we employ a new
parameterization of w, which utilizes the mean value of w(z) (<w>) as an
explicit parameter. This helps to separate the information contained in the
estimation of the distance to the last scattering surface (from the CMB) from
the information contained in the ISW effect. We then use Fisher analysis to
forecast the expected uncertainties in the measured parameters from future ISW
observations for two models of dark energy with very different time evolution
properties. For example, we demonstrate that the cross-correlation of Planck
CMB data and LSST galaxy catalogs will provide competitive constraints on w(z),
compared to a SNAP-like SNe project, for models of dark energy with a rapidly
changing equation of state (e.g. 'Kink' models). Our work confirms that, while
SNe measurements are more suitable for constraining variations in w(z) at low
redshift, the ISW effect can provide important independent constraints on w(z)
at high z.",2005-06-16T20:00:17Z
On the nature of nearby GRB/SN host galaxies,"We present and discuss optical diagnostics of the low redshift (z<0.2)
galaxies that are known to have hosted supernovae associated with gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). The three galaxies are all actively starforming sub-luminous
(L<L*) galaxies with relatively low metallicities (Z<Zsun). We find no evidence
for substantial internal extinction within any of the galaxies. We derive star
formation rates (SFR) based on H-alpha luminosities, as well as specific star
formation rates (SFFR, star formation rate per unit luminosity). For GRB 980425
(SN 1998bw) we use photometry of the supernova environment to estimate the mass
of the progentitor to > 30 Msun. These three host galaxies have global
properties (luminosities, SFR, SSFR, metallicity, colour, reddening) that
resemble those of more distant GRB host galaxies. We also compare the host
galaxies with a sample of Blue Compact Galaxies (BCGs) in the local universe,
and show that these samples have similar properties.",2005-06-28T08:16:30Z
Constraints on the Orbital Evolution of Triton,"We present simulations of Triton's post-capture orbit that confirm the
importance of Kozai-type oscillations in its orbital elements. In the context
of the tidal orbital evolution model, these variations require average
pericenter distances much higher than previously published, and the timescale
for the tidal orbital evolution of Triton becomes longer than the age of the
Solar System. Recently-discovered irregular satellites present a new constraint
on Triton's orbital history. Our numerical integrations of test particles
indicate a timescale for Triton's orbital evolution to be less than $10^5$ yrs
for a reasonable number of distant satellites to survive Triton's passage. This
timescale is inconsistent with the exclusively tidal evolution (time scale of
$>10^8$ yrs), but consistent with the interestion with the debris from
satellite-satellite collisions. Any major regular satellites will quickly
collide among themselves after being perturbed by Triton, and the resulting
debris disk would eventually be swept up by Triton; given that the total mass
of the Uranian satellite system is 40% of that of Triton, large scale evolution
is possible. This scenario could have followed either collisional or the
recently-discussed three-body-interaction-based capture.",2005-05-11T21:15:15Z
"The Surprising Anisotropy of Fast Rotating, Disky Elliptical Galaxies","The projected kinematical properties of unequal-mass merger remnants of disk
galaxies are analysed and shown to agree well with observations of disky, fast
rotating elliptical galaxies. This supports the major merger hypothesis of
early-type galaxy formation. However, in contrast to previous claims, the
merger remnants are very anisotropic with values of the anisotropy parameter
that are similar to equal-mass merger remnants that form boxy, slowly rotating
ellipticals. Including gas in the simulations does not change this result
although the line-of-sight velocity profile and the intrinsic orbital structure
are strongly affected by the presenceof gas. The kinematical difference between
boxy and disky ellipticals appears not to be the amount of anisotropy but
rather rotation and the shape of the velocity dispersion tensor. The apparent
isotropy of observed disky ellipticals is shown to result from inclination
effects. Even small inclination angles strongly reduce the measured anisotropy
of fast rotating systems, seen in projection. A second problem is the limited
amount of information that is available when measuring only the central
velocity dispersion and a characteristic rotation and ellipticity. Methods are
investigated that allow a better determination of the intrinsic anisotropy of
fast rotating early-type galaxies with known inclination angles.",2005-04-27T11:09:51Z
On the evidence for discs around Blue Straggler stars,"Recent observations of blue stragglers by De Marco et al. (2004) have
revealed continuum deficits on the blue side of the Balmer discontinuity,
leading these authors to infer the presence of discs around the stars. This
intriguing possibility may throw light on aspects of the mechanisms responsible
for at least some of these objects; current theories of blue straggler
formation invoke stellar collisions or interacting binaries, both of which
appear capable of forming a circumstellar disc.
  However, by synthesizing photospheric spectra for models of rotating blue
stragglers, we demonstrate that the Balmer jump enhancements can be wholly
attributed to the influence of oblateness and gravity darkening on the
formation of the continuum. Therefore, we are led to conclude that the
observations of De Marco et al. can be ascribed a more prosaic explanation,
that of rapid stellar rotation arising from the merger/interaction formation
process.",2005-03-21T11:16:05Z
"Discovery of multi-seeded multi-mode formation of embedded clusters in
  the Rosette Molecular Complex","An investigation based on data from the spatially complete 2MASS Survey
reveals that a remarkable burst of clustered star formation is taking place
throughout the south-east quadrant of the Rosette Molecular Cloud. Compact
clusters are forming in a multi-seeded mode, in parallel and at various places.
In addition, sparse aggregates of embedded young stars are extensively
distributed. In this study, we report the primary results and implications for
high-mass and clustered star formation in giant molecular clouds. In
particular, we incorporate for the first time the birth of medium to low-mass
stars into the scenario of sequential formation of OB clusters. Following the
emergence of the young OB cluster NGC 2244, a variety of manifestations of
forming clusters of medium to high mass appear in the vicinity of the swept-up
layer of the H{\small II} region as well as further into the molecular cloud.
The embedded clusters appear to form in a structured manner, which suggests
they follow tracks laid out by the decay of macroturbulence. We address the
possible origins of the turbulence. This leads us to propose a tree model to
interpret the neat spatial distribution of clusters within a large section of
the Rosette complex. Prominent new generation OB clusters are identified at the
root of the tree pattern.",2005-04-01T03:33:25Z
"Planetary Detection Efficiency of the Magnification 3000 Microlensing
  Event OGLE-2004-BLG-343","OGLE-2004-BLG-343 was a microlensing event with peak magnification
A_{max}=3000+/-1100, by far the highest-magnification event ever analyzed and
hence potentially extremely sensitive to planets orbiting the lens star. Due to
human error, intensive monitoring did not begin until 43 minutes after peak, at
which point the magnification had fallen to A~1200, still by far the highest
ever observed. As the light curve does not show significant deviations due to a
planet, we place upper limits on the presence of such planets by extending the
method of Yoo et al. (2004b), which combines light-curve analysis with priors
from a Galactic model of the source and lens populations, to take account of
finite-source effects. This is the first event so analyzed for which
finite-source effects are important, and hence we develop two new techniques
for evaluating these effects. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that
OGLE-2004-BLG-343 is no more sensitive to planets than two previously analyzed
events with A_{max}~100, despite the fact that it was observed at ~12 times
higher magnification. However, we show that had the event been observed over
its peak, it would have been sensitive to almost all Neptune-mass planets over
a factor of 5 of projected separation and even would have had some sensitivity
to Earth-mass planets. This shows that some microlensing events being detected
in current experiments are sensitive to very low-mass planets. We also give
suggestions on how extremely high-magnification events can be more promptly
monitored in the future.",2005-07-05T15:56:23Z
Massive galaxy clusters and the origin of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays,"We investigate whether ultra--high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) may be
preferentially produced in massive galaxy clusters, by looking for correlations
between UHECR directions and those of x-ray clusters. We find an
excess-above-random of high energy cosmic rays which correlate with massive
galaxy cluster positions. For cosmic rays with energies above 50 EeV the
observed correlation is the strongest or angles of 1.2-1.6 degrees where it has
a chance probability of about 0.1%.
  Including lower energy cosmic rays in the sample causes the angle where the
most significant correlation is found to increase, as would be expected by
virtue of instrumental and magnetic smearing increasing at lower energy.
  These results suggest that some UHECR are produced in galaxy clusters, or in
objects that preferentially populate galaxy clusters.",2005-07-29T19:53:38Z
Indirect evidence for short period magnetic cycles in W UMa stars,"Complex period variations of five W UMa type binaries (AB And, OO Aql, DK
Cyg, V566 Oph, U Peg) were investigated by analyzing their O--C diagrams, and
several common features were found. Four of the five systems show secular
period variations at a constant rate on the order of |dP / dt 1/P | ~ 10E-7
1/yr. In the case of AB And, OO Aql, and U Peg a high-amplitude, nearly
one-century long quasi-sinusoidal pattern was also found. It might be explained
as light-time effect, or by some magnetic phenomena, although the mathematical,
and consequently the physical, parameters of these fits are very problematic,
as the obtained periods are very close to the length of the total data range.
The most interesting feature of the studied O--C diagrams is a low amplitude
(2-4 x 10E-3 d) modulation with a period around 18--20 yr in four of the five
cases. This phenomenon might be indirect evidence of some magnetic cycle in
late-type overcontact binaries as an analog to the observed activity cycles in
RS CVn systems.",2005-07-09T13:29:52Z
Detection of SiO Maser Emission in V838 Mon,"We report on the detection of 43 GHz SiO maser emission in V838 Mon, a
prototype of a new class of eruptive variables, in which a red supergiant was
formed after the nova-like eruption in 2002. The detection of SiO masers
indicates that the star formed after the eruption is indeed a kind of cool
mass-losing object with circumstellar masers. The measured radial velocity and
the intensity of maser emission are consistent with the object being located at
the distance of about 7 kpc from the sun. It also suggests that a considerable
percentage of SiO masing objects in the Galaxy are formed in the same mechanism
as that created V838 Mon.",2005-07-15T05:02:23Z
"STEllar Content and Kinematics from high resolution galactic spectra via
  Maximum A Posteriori","We introduce STECKMAP (STEllar Content and Kinematics via Maximum A
Posteriori), a method to recover the kinematical properties of a galaxy
simultaneously with its stellar content from integrated light spectra. It is an
extension of STECMAP (astro-ph/0505209) to the general case where the velocity
distribution of the underlying stars is also unknown.
  %and can be used as is for the analysis of large sets of data. The
reconstructions of the stellar age distribution, the age-metallicity relation,
and the Line-Of-Sight Velocity Distribution (LOSVD) are all non-parametric,
i.e. no specific shape is assumed. The only a propri we use are positivity and
the requirement that the solution is smooth enough. The smoothness parameter
can be set by GCV according to the level of noise in the data in order to avoid
overinterpretation. We use single stellar populations (SSP) from PEGASE-HR
(R=10000, lambda lambda = 4000-6800 Angstrom, Le Borgne et al. 2004) to test
the method through realistic simulations. Non-Gaussianities in LOSVDs are
reliably recovered with SNR as low as 20 per 0.2 Angstrom pixel. It turns out
that the recovery of the stellar content is not degraded by the simultaneous
recovery of the kinematic distribution, so that the resolution in age and error
estimates given in Ocvirk et al. 2005 remain appropriate when used with
STECKMAP. We also explore the case of age-dependent kinematics (i.e. when each
stellar component has its own LOSVD). We separate the bulge and disk components
of an idealized simplified spiral galaxy in integrated light from high quality
pseudo data (SNR=100 per pixel, R=10000), and constrain the kinematics (mean
projected velocity, projected velocity dispersion) and age of both components.",2005-06-30T20:37:18Z
Clustered Massive Star Formation in Molecular Clouds,"I review some important questions in the field of massive star formation:
What are the initial conditions for proto star clusters and how do they arise?
What are the initial conditions for individual massive star formation within
star clusters? How do massive protostars accumulate their mass? I compare the
Turbulent Core Model (McKee & Tan 2003) to several nearby regions, including
Orion KL. Here I also discuss the origin of BN's high proper motion.",2005-07-05T20:33:38Z
"Fundamental Parameters of Low Mass X-ray Binaries II: X-Ray Persistent
  Systems","The determination of fundamental parameters in X-ray luminous (persistent)
X-ray binaries has been classically hampered by the large optical luminosity of
the accretion disc. New methods, based on irradiation of the donor star and
burst oscillations, provide the opportunity to derive dynamical information and
mass constraints in many persistent systems for the first time. These
techniques are here reviewed and the latest results presented.",2005-06-24T12:02:30Z
A universal velocity distribution of relaxed collisionless structures,"Several general trends have been identified for equilibrated,
self-gravitating collisionless systems, such as density or anisotropy profiles.
These are integrated quantities which naturally depend on the underlying
velocity distribution function (VDF) of the system. We study this VDF through a
set of numerical simulations, which allow us to extract both the radial and the
tangential VDF. We find that the shape of the VDF is universal, in the sense
that it depends only on two things namely the dispersion (radial or tangential)
and the local slope of the density. Both the radial and the tangential VDF's
are universal for a collection of simulations, including controlled collisions
with very different initial conditions, radial infall simulation, and
structures formed in cosmological simulations.",2005-05-19T20:00:11Z
The Shape-Alignment relation in $Λ$CDM Cosmic Structures,"In this paper we study the supercluster - cluster morphological properties
using one of the largest ($2\times 512^{3}$ SPH+N-body simulations of large
scale structure formation in a $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the publicly
available code GADGET. We find that filamentary (prolate-like) shapes are the
dominant supercluster and cluster dark matter halo morphological feature, in
agreement with previous studies. However, the baryonic gas component of the
clusters is predominantly spherical. We investigate the alignment between
cluster halos (using either their DM or baryonic components) and their parent
supercluster major-axis orientation, finding that clusters show such a
preferential alignment. Combining the shape and the alignment statistics, we
also find that the amplitude of supercluster - cluster alignment increases
although weakly with supercluster filamentariness.",2005-05-31T11:44:03Z
A statistical study of 233 pulsar proper motions,"We present and analyse a catalogue of 233 pulsars with proper motion
measurements. The sample contains a wide variety of pulsars including recycled
objects and those associated with globular clusters or supernova remnants.
After taking the most precise proper motions for those pulsars for which
multiple measurements are available, the majority of the proper motions (58%)
are derived from pulsar timing methods, 41% using interferometers and the
remaining 1% using optical telescopes. Many of the 1-D and 2-D speeds
(referring to speeds measured in one coordinate only and the magnitudes of the
transverse velocities respectively) derived from these measurements are
somewhat lower than earlier estimates because of the use of the most recent
electron density model in determining pulsar distances. The mean 1-D speeds for
the normal and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6) km/s respectively. The
corresponding mean 2-D speeds are 246(22) and 87(13) km/s. PSRs B2011+38 and
B2224+64 have the highest inferred 2-D speeds of ~1600 km/s. We study the mean
speeds for different subsamples and find that, in general, they agree with
previous results. Applying a novel deconvolution technique to the sample of 73
pulsars with characteristic ages less than 3 Myr, we find the mean 3-D pulsar
birth velocity to be 400(40) km/s. The distribution of velocities is well
described by a Maxwellian distribution with 1-D rms sigma=265 km/s. There is no
evidence for a bimodal velocity distribution. The proper motions for PSRs
B1830-08 and B2334+61 are consistent with their proposed associations with the
supernova remnants W41 and G114.3+0.3 respectively.",2005-04-26T23:46:59Z
B-Inflation,"We propose a novel model of inflation based on a large class of covariant
effective actions containing only the second derivatives of a scalar field. The
initial conditions leading to the inflationary solutions in this model are
rather generic. The graceful exit from the inflationary regime is natural once
the first order derivative terms are included.",2005-04-25T22:51:08Z
Total and Jet Blandford-Znajek Power in Presence of Accretion Disk,"A rotating black hole probably powers ultrarelativistic jets in gamma-ray
bursts, relativistic jets from some active galactic nuclei, and jets from some
black hole x-ray binaries. Prior estimates of the power output of a black hole
have assumed an infinitely thin disk, a magnetic field based upon a slowly
rotating black hole, and have not self-consistently determined the geometry or
magnitude of the magnetic field for a realistic accretion disk. We provide
useful formulae for the total and jet Blandford-Znajek (BZ) power and
efficiency as determined self-consistently from general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic numerical models. Of all jet mechanisms, we suggest that
only the BZ mechanism is able to produce an ultrarelativistic jet.",2005-06-16T17:53:25Z
Neutron Diffusion and Nucleosynthesis in an Inhomogeneous Big Bang Model,"This article presents an original code for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in a
baryon inhomogeneous model of the universe. In this code neutron diffusion
between high and low baryon density regions is calculated simultaneously with
the nuclear reactions and weak decays that compose the nucleosynthesis process.
The size of the model determines the time when neutron diffusion becomes
significant. This article describes in detail how the time of neutron diffusion
relative to the time of nucleosynthesis affects the final abundances of He4,
deuterium and Li7. These results will be compared with the most recent
observational constraints of He4, deuterium and Li7. This inhomogeneous model
has He4 and deuterium constraints in concordance for baryon to photon ratio eta
= (4.3 - 12.3) X 10^{-10} Li7 constraints are brought into concordance with the
other isotope constraints by including a depletion factor as high as 5.9. These
ranges for the baryon to photon ratio and for the depletion factor are larger
than the ranges from a Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis model.",2005-06-16T01:23:40Z
Smoothing spline primordial power spectrum reconstruction,"We reconstruct the shape of the primordial power spectrum (PPS) using a
smoothing spline. Our adapted smoothing spline technique provides a
complementary method to existing efforts to search for smooth features in the
PPS, such as a running spectral index. With this technique we find no
significant indication with WMAP first-year data that the PPS deviates from
Harrison-Zeldovich and no evidence for loss of power on large scales. We also
examine the effect on the cosmological parameters of the additional PPS
freedom. Smooth variations in the PPS are not significantly degenerate with
other cosmological parameters, but the spline reconstruction greatly increases
the errors on the optical depth and baryon fraction.",2005-06-28T20:59:55Z
"The Early (<1 hr) Multi-Color Afterglow of GRB 050502a: Possible
  Evidence for a Uniform Medium with Density Clumps","The 2-m robotic Liverpool Telescope reacted promptly to the gamma-ray burst
GRB 050502a discovered by INTEGRAL and started observing 3 min after the onset
of the GRB. The automatic identification of a bright afterglow of r'~15.8
triggered for the first time an observation sequence in the BVr'i' filters
during the first hour after a GRB. Observations continued for ~1 day using the
RoboNet-1.0 network of 2-m robotic telescopes. The light curve in all filters
can be described by a simple power law with index of 1.2 +/- 0.1. We find
evidence for a bump rising at t~0.02 days in all filters. From the spectrum and
the light curve we investigate different interpretative scenarios and we find
possible evidence for a uniform circumburst medium with clumps in density, as
in the case of GRB 021004. Other interpretations of such bumps, such as the
effect of energy injection through refreshed shocks or the result of a variable
energy profile, are less favored. The optical afterglow of GRB 050502a is
likely to be the result of slow electron cooling with the optical bands lying
between the synchrotron peak frequency and the cooling frequency.",2005-07-27T15:19:22Z
Early decline spectra of Nova SMC 2001 and Nova LMC 2002,"We report results on the spectroscopic follow-up of Nova SMC 2001 and Nova
LMC 2002 carried out at La Silla. The analysis of the spectroscopic evolution
shows that these objects belong to the {\sl Fe II} class, according to the
Cerro Tololo scheme. From the line fluxes and the expansion velocities, we have
derived an approximate mass for the ejected shells of 2$\div3\times 10^{-4}

suggest a clumpy structure for the ejecta.",2005-04-06T15:50:39Z
A Potential Supernova Remnant/X-ray Binary Association in M31,"The well-studied X-ray/Optical/Radio supernova remnant DDB 1-15 (CXOM31
J004327.8+411829; r3-63) in M31 has been investigated with archival XMM-Newton
and Chandra observations. The timing data from XMM-Newton reveals a power
density spectrum (PDS) characteristic of accreting compact objects in X-ray
binaries (XRBs). The PDS shows features typical of Roche lobe overflow
accretion, hinting that the XRB is low-mass. The Chandra observations resolve
the SNR into a shell and show a variable count rate at the 94% confidence level
in the northwest quadrant. Together, these XMM-Newton and Chandra data suggest
that there is an XRB in the SNR r3-63 and that the XRB is located in the
northwestern portion of the SNR. The currently-available X-ray and optical data
show no evidence that the XRB is high-mass. If the XRB is low-mass, r3-63 would
be the first SNR found to contain a low-mass X-ray binary.",2005-08-08T18:01:39Z
The SDSS-XMM Quasar Sample: First Results,"We have searched in the XMM-Newton public archive for quasars in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) First Data Release (DR1), and found 55 lying in the
field of a XMM-Newton observation with exposure times >20 ksec (as of August,
2004). The 35 quasars which yielded good X-ray spectra span redshifts from 0.5
to 2.5. The large collecting area of XMM-Newton allows us to investigate the
dependence of the X-ray spectra of quasars on luminosity, redshift and optical
colors. We find: (1) no evolution of X-ray slope Gamma with either redshift or
luminosity; (2) no correlation between Gamma or absorbing column density and
the optical to X-ray ratio, alpha_{OX}; (4) no relation between alpha_{OX} and
optical colors. The two latter results suggest that obscuration is not the
dominant cause of the spread in X-ray slope or optical color. We find four
unusual quasars, 10% of the sample: three are absorbed (N_H>10^{22} cm^{-2}),
of which one has high luminosity (1.5x10$^{44} erg/s); the fourth has
Gamma=0.6+-0.2, far flatter than the typical value of 1.8-2.0, and a strong
emission line (EW=1.2+-$0.4 keV) which, if Fe-K, implies a redshift of ~1.4.",2005-07-19T09:34:23Z
New Mass Loss Measurements from Astrospheric Lyman-alpha Absorption,"Measurements of stellar mass loss rates are used to assess how wind strength
varies with coronal activity and age for solar-like stars. Mass loss generally
increases with activity, but we find evidence that winds suddenly weaken at a
certain activity threshold. Very active stars are often observed to have polar
starspots, and we speculate that the magnetic field geometry associated with
these spots may be inhibiting the winds. Our inferred mass-loss/age relation
represents an empirical estimate of the history of the solar wind. This result
is important for planetary studies as well as solar/stellar astronomy, since
solar wind erosion may have played an important role in the evolution of
planetary atmospheres.",2005-06-17T02:21:34Z
"Nitrogen-deficient and iron-rich associated absorbers with oversolar
  metallicities towards the quasar HE0141-3932","HE0141-3932 (zem=1.80) is a bright blue radio-quite quasar which reveals an
emission line spectrum with an unusually weak Ly-alpha line. In addition, large
redshift differences (Delta z=0.05) are observed between high ionization and
low ionization emission lines. Absorption systems identified at z=1.78, 1.71,
and 1.68 show mild oversolar metallicities (Z ~= 1-2Zsolar) and can be
attributed to the associated gas clouds ejected from the circumnuclear region.
The joint analysis of the emission and absorption lines leads to the conclusion
that this quasar is seen almost pole-on. Its apparent luminosity may be Doppler
boosted by ~10 times. The absorbing gas shows high abundance of Fe, Mg, and Al
([Fe, Mg, Al/C] ~= 0.15+/-0.10) along with underabundance of N ([N/C]<=-0.5).
This abundance pattern is at variance with current chemical evolution models of
QSOs predicting [N/C]>0 and [Fe/C]<0 at Z ~ Zsolar. Full details of this work
are given in Reimers et al. (2005).",2005-06-20T08:41:06Z
"Growth of Hydrodynamic Perturbations in Accretion Disks: Possible Route
  to Non-Magnetic Turbulence","We study the possible origin of hydrodynamic turbulence in cold accretion
disks such as those in star-forming systems and quiescent cataclysmic
variables. As these systems are expected to have neutral gas, the turbulent
viscosity is likely to be hydrodynamic in origin, not magnetohydrodynamic.
Therefore MRI will be sluggish or even absent in such disks. Although there are
no exponentially growing eigenmodes in a hydrodynamic disk, because of the
non-normal nature of the eigenmodes, a large transient growth in the energy is
still possible, which may enable the system to switch to a turbulent state. For
a Keplerian disk, we estimate that the energy will grow by a factor of 1000 for
a Reynolds number close to a million.",2005-07-02T01:53:08Z
Origin of long-period Alfv{é}n waves in the solar wind,"We suggest that the observed long-period Alfv{\'e}n waves in the solar wind
may be generated in the solar interior due to the pulsation of the Sun in the
fundamental radial mode. The period of this pulsation is about 1 hour. The
pulsation causes a periodical variation of density and large-scale magnetic
field, this affecting the Alfv{\'e}n speed in the solar interior. Consequently
the Alfv{\'e}n waves with the half frequency of pulsation (i.e. with the double
period) can be parametrically amplified in the interior below the convection
zone due to the recently suggested swing wave-wave interaction. Therefore the
amplified Alfv{\'e}n waves have periods of several hours. The waves can
propagate upwards through the convection zone to the solar atmosphere and cause
the observed long-period Alfv{\'e}n oscillations in the solar wind.",2005-06-30T13:57:32Z
Strong mean field dynamos require supercritical helicity fluxes,"Several one and two dimensional mean field models are analyzed where the
effects of current helicity fluxes and boundaries are included within the
framework of the dynamical quenching model. In contrast to the case with
periodic boundary conditions, the final saturation energy of the mean field
decreases inversely proportional to the magnetic Reynolds number. If a
nondimensional scaling factor in the current helicity flux exceeds a certain
critical value, the dynamo can operate even without kinetic helicity, i.e. it
is based only on shear and current helicity fluxes, as first suggested by
Vishniac & Cho (2001, ApJ 550, 752). Only above this threshold is the current
helicity flux also able to alleviate catastrophic quenching. The fact that
certain turbulence simulations have now shown apparently non-resistively
limited mean field saturation amplitudes may be suggestive of the current
helicity flux having exceeded this critical value. Even below this critical
value the field still reaches appreciable strength at the end of the kinematic
phase, which is in qualitative agreement with dynamos in periodic domains.
However, for large magnetic Reynolds numbers the field undergoes subsequent
variations on a resistive time scale when, for long periods, the field can be
extremely weak.",2005-05-23T19:41:59Z
Formation and evolution of primordial black holes after hybrid inflation,"We examine the formation and evolution of primordial black holes (PBH's)
after hybrid inflation. Our goal is to assess the effects of various
theoretical uncertainties on the extrapolation from a given inflation model to
a spectrum of primordial black hole masses. The context of our work is an
examination of the possibility [Chen and Adler (2003), MacGibbon (1987)] that
the dark matter is comprised of Planck-mass black hole remnants (BHR's). As an
example we focus on a particular scenario [Chen (2003)] in which the black
holes form from quantum perturbations that were generated during hybrid
inflation. We find the correspondence between hybrid inflation parameters and
the range of initial PBH masses that would allow BHR's to comprise the dark
matter, taking account of the possible early presence of radiation and its
accretion onto the PBH's.",2005-04-27T18:27:27Z
The value of density measurements in stellar coronae,"The grating instruments on board Chandra and XMM-Newton now allow
measurements of electron densities. These rely on the ratios of fluxes in
emission lines, where one line depends on both collisional and radiative decay
rates. The electron density is required to constrain the physical extent of the
emitting region, and large samples of measurements are of interest in the
context of trends in coronal activity. Here we discuss the important He {\sc
i}-like ions and the differences in densities that result when different
current data bases are used.",2005-04-06T12:09:26Z
Optical identification of IGR J19140+0951,"IGR J19140+0951 was discovered by INTEGRAL in 2003 in the 4-100 keV band.
Observations with INTEGRAL and RXTE provide a tentative identification as a
high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) with a neutron star as accretor. However, an
optical counterpart was thus far not established, nor was the presence of a
pulsar which is commonly observed in HMXBs. We observed IGR J19140+0951 with
Chandra and find the source to be active at a similar flux as previous
measurements. The lightcurve shows a marginally significant oscillation at 6.5
ks which requires confirmation. We determine a sub-arcsecond position from the
Chandra data and identify the heavily reddened optical counterpart 2MASS
19140422+0952577 in the 2MASS catalog. Optical follow-up observations with the
William Herschel Telescope at La Palma exhibit a continuum spectrum coming out
of extinction above 7000 Angstrom without strong absorption or emission
features. V, I and Ks band photometry point to an optical counterpart extincted
by A[V]=11+/-2. The extinction is consistent with the interstellar value. None
of the data reject the suspicion that IGR J19140+0951 is an HMXB with
additional circumstellar obscuration around the accretor.",2005-05-12T13:57:23Z
Fourier Phase Analysis of SDSS Galaxies,"We present a first analysis of the clustering of SDSS galaxies using the
distribution function of the sum of Fourier phases. This statistic was recently
proposed by one of authors as a new method to probe phase correlations of
cosmological density fields. Since the Fourier phases are statistically
independent of Fourier amplitudes, the phase statistic plays a complementary
role to the conventional two-point statistics of galaxy clustering. In
particular, we focus on the distribution functions of phase sum over three
closed wavevectors as a function of the configurations of triangle wavevectors.
We find that the observed distribution functions of phase sum are in good
agreement with the lowest-order approximation from perturbation theory. For
direct comparison with observations, we construct mock catalogs from N-body
simulations taking account of several observational effects such as the survey
geometry, the redshift distortion, and the discreteness due to the limited
number of data. Indeed the observed phase correlations for the galaxies in the
range of absolute magnitude -22<Mr<-18 agree well with those for Lambda CDM
predictions with sigma8=0.9 evolved from Gaussian initial condition. This
agreement implies that the galaxy biasing is approximately linear in redshift
space. Instead, assuming that the galaxy biasing is described by a quadratic
deterministic function at scale larger than 30Mpc/h, we can constrain the ratio
of the quadratic biasing parameter b2 to the linear biasing parameter b1. We
find that resulting b2/b1 is mainly dependent on sigma8 and that it is well
fitted by b2/b1=0.54(+-0.06)-0.62(+-0.08)sigma8 in CDM models. Indeed, b2/b1 is
nearly zero when sigma8=0.9.",2005-06-09T09:18:41Z

(PDF) of galaxy fluctuations in the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) cone, covering
0.4x0.4 deg between 0.4<z<1.5. The second moment of the PDF, i.e. the rms

over the full redshift baseline investigated: we find that, in redshift space,
sigma_8 for galaxies brighter than M=-20+5log h has a mean value of 0.94\pm0.07
in the redshift interval 0.7<z<1.5. The third moment, i.e. the skewness,
increases with cosmic time: we find that the probability of having underdense
regions is greater at z~0.7 than it was at z~1.5. By comparing the PDF of
galaxy density contrasts with the theoretically predicted PDF of mass
fluctuations we infer the redshift-, density-, and scale-dependence of the
biasing function b(z, \delta, R) between galaxy and matter overdensities up to
redshift z=1.5. Our results can be summarized as follows: i) the galaxy bias is
an increasing function of redshift: evolution is marginal up to z~0.8 and more
pronounced for z>0.8; ii) the formation of bright galaxies is inhibited below a
characteristic mass-overdensity threshold whose amplitude increases with
redshift and luminosity; iii) the biasing function is non linear in all the
redshift bins investigated with non-linear effects of the order of a few to 10%

"An abrupt drop in the coherence of the lower kilohertz QPO in 4U
  1636-536","Using archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), we study in
a systematic way the variation of the quality factor and amplitude of the lower
and upper kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) in the low-mass X-ray binary
4U1636-536, over a frequency range from ~550 Hz to ~1200 Hz. When represented
in a quality factor versus frequency diagram, the upper and lower QPOs follow
two different tracks, suggesting that they are distinct phenomena, although not
completely independent because the frequency difference of the two QPOs, when
detected simultaneously, remains within ~60 Hz of half the neutron star spin
frequency (at 581 Hz). The quality factor of the lower kHz QPO increases with
frequency up to a maximum of ~200 at ~850 Hz, then drops precipitously to Q~50
at the highest detected frequencies ~920 Hz. A ceiling of the lower QPO
frequencies at 920 Hz is also clearly seen in a frequency versus count rate
diagram.
  The quality factor provides a measure of the coherence of the underlying
oscillator. For exponentially damped sinusoidal shots, the highest Q observed
corresponds to an oscillator coherence time of ~ 0.1 seconds. All existing QPO
models face challenges in explaining such a long coherence time and the
significantly different behaviours of the quality factors of the upper and
lower QPOs reported here. It is therefore difficult to be certain of the
implications of the abrupt change in the lower QPO at ~850 Hz. We discuss
various possible causes, including that the drop in coherence is ultimately
caused by effects related to the innermost stable circular orbit (abridged).",2005-05-19T11:40:12Z
"X-Ray Emission and Optical Polarization of V1432 Aquilae: An
  Asynchronous Polar","A detailed analysis of X-ray data from ROSAT, ASCA, XMM and RXTE for the
asynchronous polar V1432 Aql along with Stokes polarimetry data from SAAO, is
presented. Power spectra from long-baseline ROSAT data show a spin period of
12150s along with several system related frequency components. However, the
second harmonic of the spin period dominates power spectrum in the XMM data.
For the optical circular polarization, the dominant period corresponds to half
the spin period. The ROSAT data can be explained as due to accretion onto two
hot spots that are not anti-podal. The variations seen in the optical
polarization and the ASCA and XMM data suggest the presence of at least three
accretion foot prints on the white dwarf surface. Two spectral models, a
multi-temperature plasma and a photo-ionized plasma model, are used for
spectral study. The RXTE PCA data are used to constrain the white dwarf mass to
1.2$\pm$0.1 M_odot using the multi-temperature plasma model. A strong soft
X-ray excess (<0.8 keV) in the XMM MOS data is well modeled by a blackbody
component having a temperature of 80-90 eV. The plasma emission lines seen at
6.7 and 7.0 keV are well fitted using the multi-temperature plasma model,
however an additional Gaussian is needed for the 6.4 keV line. The
multi-temperature plasma model requires a homogeneous absorber fully covering
the source and a partial absorber covering 65% of the source. The photo-ionized
plasma model, with a range of Fe column densities, gives a slightly better
overall fit and fits all emission lines. The presence of a strong blackbody
component, a spin period of 12150s, modulation of the 6.4 keV line flux with
spin period, and a very hard X-ray component suggest that V1432 Aql is a polar
with X-ray spectral properties similar to that of a soft intermediate polar.",2005-05-12T07:40:51Z
"Masers and the Massive Star Formation Process: New Insights Through
  Infrared Observations","Our mid-infrared and near-infrared surveys over the last five years have
helped to strengthen and clarify the relationships between water, methanol, and
OH masers and the star formation process. Our surveys show that maser emission
seems to be more closely associated with mid-infrared emission than cm radio
continuum emission from UC HII regions. We find that masers of all molecular
species surveyed trace a wide variety of phenomena and show a proclivity for
linear distributions. The vast majority of these linear distributions can be
explained by outflows or shocks, and in general do not appear to trace
circumstellar disks as was previously thought. Some water and methanol masers
that are not associated with radio continuum emission appear to trace
infrared-bright hot cores, the earliest observable stage of massive stellar
life before the onset of a UC HII region.",2005-06-08T00:21:59Z
"Superhumps in Cataclysmic Binaries. XXV. q_crit, epsilon(q), and
  Mass-Radius","We report on successes and failures in searching for positive superhumps in
cataclysmic variables, and show the superhumping fraction as a function of
orbital period. Basically, all short-period systems do, all long-period systems
don't, and a 50% success rate is found at P_orb=3.1+-0.2 hr. We can use this to
measure the critical mass ratio for the creation of superhumps. With a
mass-radius relation appropriate for cataclysmic variables, and an assumed mean
white-dwarf mass of 0.75 M_sol, we find a mass ratio q_crit=0.35+-0.02.
  We also report superhump studies of several stars of independently known mass
ratio: OU Virginis, XZ Eridani, UU Aquarii, and KV UMa (= XTE J1118+480). The
latter two are of special interest, because they represent the most extreme
mass ratios for which accurate superhump measurements have been made. We use
these to improve the epsilon(q) calibration, by which we can infer the elusive
q from the easy-to-measure epsilon (the fractional period excess of P_superhump
over P_orb). This relation allows mass and radius estimates for the secondary
star in any CV showing superhumps. The consequent mass-radius law shows an
apparent discontinuity in radius near 0.2 M_sol, as predicted by the disrupted
magnetic braking model for the 2.1-2.7 hour period gap. This is effectively the
""empirical main sequence"" for CV secondaries.",2005-07-15T12:32:02Z
Fossil records of cosmic reionization in galactic stellar halos,"Galactic stellar halos have long been considered to contain fossil
information on early dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies. We propose
that the surface brightness distributions of old stellar halos contain the
influence of reionization on early formation histories of galaxies. By assuming
that reionization significantly suppresses star formation in small subgalactic
clumps virialized after reionization redshift ($z_{\rm reion}$), we first
numerically investigate how structural and kinematical properties of stellar
halos formed from merging of these subgalactic clumps depend on $z_{\rm
reion}$. We then discuss what observable properties of galactic stellar halos
offer us the fossil records of reionization influence on hierarchical formation
of halos based on the current results of numerical simulations. We particularly
suggest that both the half-light radius of stellar halos and the slope of their
surface brightness profile contain useful information on when star formation in
subgalactic clumps were significantly influenced by reionization. By using the
simulated surface brightness distributions of galactic stellar halos for models
with different $z_{\rm reion}$, we also discuss how wide-field imaging studies
of extragalactic halos will help us to elucidate the epoch of cosmic
reionization.",2005-05-27T08:47:26Z
FUV Spectroscopy of the Dwarf Novae SS Cygni and WX Hydri in Quiescence,"We present time-resolved FUV spectra of the dwarf novae SS Cyg and WX Hyi in
quiescence from observations using the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope on the
Astro-1 and Astro-2 Space Shuttle missions and the Goddard High Resolution
Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. Both dwarf novae are characterized
by blue continua that extend to the Lyman limit punctuated by broad emission
lines including transitions of O VI, N V, Si IV, and C IV. The continuum of WX
Hyi can be fit with a white dwarf model with physically reasonable model
parameters, but neither system actually shows unambiguous signatures of white
dwarf emission. The shape and flux of the spectrum of SS Cyg cannot be
self-consistently reconciled with a white dwarf providing all of the FUV
continuum flux. Combination white dwarf/disk or white dwarf/optically thin
plasma models improve the fit but still do not give physically reasonable model
parameters for a quiescent dwarf nova. Assuming that the UV emission lines
arise from the disk, the line shapes indicate that surface fluxes fall roughly
as R^{-2} in both systems. Fits to the double-peaked line profiles in SS Cyg
indicate that the FUV line forming region is concentrated closer to the white
dwarf than that of the optical lines and provide no evidence of a hole in the
inner disk. Although the flux from SS Cyg was relatively constant during all of
our observations, WX Hyi showed significant variability during the GHRS
observations. In WX Hyi, the line and continuum fluxes are (with the exception
of He II) highly correlated, indicating a link between the formation mechanisms
of the line and continuum regions.",2005-05-18T19:38:09Z
A dearth of planetary transits in the direction of NGC 6940,"We present results of our survey for planetary transits in the field of NGC
6940. We think nearly all of our observed stars are field stars. We have
obtained high precision (3-10 millimags at the bright end) photometric
observations of 50,000 stars spanning 18 nights in an attempt to identify low
amplitude and short period transit events. We have used a matched filter
analysis to identify 14 stars that show multiple events, and four stars that
show single transits. Of these 18 candidates, we have identified two that
should be further researched. However, none of the candidates are convincing

A Dynamical Simulation of the Debris Disk Around HD 141569A,"We study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in the
scattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around HD 141569A. We
explore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag from
the gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating and
maintaining these structures. We use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetric
model to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that a
broad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. This model
also suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as the
observed dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistent
with submillimeter mass measurements. We model in two dimensions the effects of
a fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,
coplanar orbit. We track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,
planetesimals, and dust. We conclude that the surface density distribution
reflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. Our most
viable model features a disk of initial radius 400 AU, a gas mass of 50
M_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within
4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. The model reproduces some features of HD
141569A's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it does
not reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor the
observed clearing in the inner disk. For the latter, we consider the effect of
a 5 M_Jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of HD
141569A.",2005-03-21T16:00:53Z
Pieces of the puzzle: Ancient substructure in the Galactic disk,"We search for signatures of past accretion events in the Milky Way in the
recently published catalogue by Nordstrom et al.(2004), containing accurate
spatial and kinematic information as well as metallicities for 13240 nearby
stars. To optimize our strategy, we use numerical simulations to characterize
the properties of the debris from disrupted satellites. We find that stars with
a common progenitor should show distinct correlations between their orbital
parameters; in particular, between the apocentre A and pericentre P, as well as
their z-angular momentum (L_z). In the APL-space, such stars are expected to
cluster around regions of roughly constant eccentricity.
  The APL space for the Nordstrom catalogue exhibits a wealth of substructure,
much of which can be linked to dynamical perturbations induced by spiral arms
and the Galactic bar. However, our analysis also reveals a statistically
significant excess of stars on orbits of common (moderate) eccentricity,
analogous to the pattern expected for merger debris. Besides being dynamically
peculiar, the 274 stars in these substructures have very distinct metallicity
and age distributions, providing further evidence of their extra-Galactic
provenance. It is possible to identify among these stars, three coherent Groups
with characteristic ages and metallicities, that, in all likelihood, correspond
to the remains of disrupted satellites. [abridged]",2005-05-19T10:17:49Z
"Discovery of a Strongly Lensed Galaxy at z=3.9 behind a z=0.83 Galaxy
  Cluster","We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of three
gravitationally-lensed images of a galaxy at z=3.9 in the background of a
distant, rich cluster of galaxies at z=0.83, on the basis of observations with
Faint Object Camera And Spectrograph (FOCAS) on the Subaru telescope. We
construct a simple lens model of the cluster mass distribution based on Jee et
al.'s weak lensing mass estimates from deep, high-resolution images by Advanced
Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. The lens model can
account simultaneously for the observed image configuration and the flux ratio
of the closer pair located close to the critical curve. The parities of the
three images are also consistent with the lensing hypothesis. Since this galaxy
is apparently bright (i'_{AB} \sim 23.7) for its redshift due to the
magnification, it serves as a good high redshift target on which we can make
extensive and detailed studies based on multi-wavelength imaging and
spectroscopy.",2005-06-30T00:20:26Z
Magnetars origin and progenitors with enhanced rotation,"Among a dozen known magnetar candidates there are no binary objects. As an
estimate of a fraction of binary neutron stars is about 10% it is reasonable to
address the question of solitarity of magnetars, to estimate theoretically the
fraction of binary objects among them, and to mark o probable companions. We
present population synthesis calculations of binary systems. Our goal is to
estimate the number of neutron stars originated from progenitors with enhanced
rotation, as such compact objects can be expected to have large magnetic
fields, ie. they can be magnetars. The fraction of such neutron stars in our
calculations is about 13-16%. Most of these objects are isolated due to
coalescences of components prior to a neutron star formation, or due to a
system disruption after a supernova explosion. The fraction of such neutron
stars in survived binaries is about 1% or lower. Their most numerous companions
are black holes.",2005-05-19T13:33:03Z
Turbulence and Magnetic Fields in Astrophysical Plasmas,"We discuss the current understanding of the most basic properties of
astrophysical MHD turbulence and trace the origins of the modern views and
theoretical uncertainties to the ideas set forth in 1950s and 1960s by
Iroshnikov, Kraichnan, Batchelor, Schlueter and Biermann. Universal aspects of
the theory are emphasised. Two main astrophysical applications are touched
upon: turbulence in the solar wind and in clusters of galaxies. These are, in a
certain (very approximate) sense, two ``pure'' cases of small-scale turbulence,
where theoretical models of the two main regimes of MHD turbulence -- with and
without a strong mean magnetic field -- can be put to the test. They are also
good examples of a complication that is more or less generic in astrophysical
plasmas: the MHD description is, in fact, insufficient for astrophysical
turbulence and plasma physics must make an entrance.",2005-07-29T02:10:04Z
"Wide-Angle Wind Driven Bipolar Outflows: High Resolution Models with
  Application to Source I of the Becklin-Neugebauer / Kleinmann-Low OMC-I
  Region","We carry out high resolution simulations of the inner regions of a wide angle
wind driven bipolar outflow using an Adaptive Mesh Refinement code. Our code
follows H-He gas with molecular, atomic and ionic components and the associated
time dependent molecular chemistry and ionization dynamics with radiative
cooling. Our simulations explore the nature of the outflow when a spherical
wind expands into a rotating, collapsing envelope. We compare with key
observational properties of the outflow system of Source I in the BN/KL region.
  Our calculations show that the wind evacuates a bipolar outflow cavity in the
infalling envelope. We find the head of the outflow to be unstable and that it
rapidly fragments into clumps. We resolve the dynamics of the strong shear
layer which defines the side walls of the cavity. We conjecture that this layer
is the likely site of maser emission and examine its morphology and rotational
properties. The shell of swept up ambient gas that delineates the cavity edge
retains its angular momentum. This rotation is roughly consistent with that
observed in the Source I SiO maser spots. The observed proper motions and
line-of-sight velocity are approximately reproduced by the model. The cavity
shell at the base of the flow assumes an X-shaped morphology which is also
consistent with Source I. We conclude that the wide opening angle of the
outflow is evidence that a wide-angle wind drives the Source I outflow and not
a collimated jet.",2005-06-08T03:46:47Z
"Molecular Hydrogen in Orion as Observed by the Far Ultraviolet
  Spectroscopic Explorer","Diffuse far-ultraviolet stellar emission scattered by dust grains has been
observed in a region near the Orion Nebula. In addition to the scattered
stellar continuum, emission and absorption features produced by molecular
hydrogen have been identified. In this Letter, we present an analysis of this
absorption and fluorescent emission from molecular hydrogen in Orion. We model
the spectra obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer using
optical depth templates and a fluorescent emission code. These results are
surprising because previous studies have found little ultraviolet absorption
from H_2 in this region, and the emission is coming from a seemingly empty part
of the nebula. We find that the emission fills in the observed absorption lines
where the two overlap. These data support the claim that fluorescent excitation
by ultraviolet photons is the primary mechanism producing the near-infrared
emission spectrum observed in the outer regions of the Orion Nebula.",2005-07-15T15:52:21Z
Searching for Transiting Planets in Stellar Systems,"We analyze the properties of searches devoted to finding planetary transits
by observing simple stellar systems, such as globular clusters, open clusters,
and the Galactic bulge. We develop the analytic tools necessary to predict the
number of planets that a survey will detect as a function of the parameters of
the system, the observational setup, site properties, and planet properties. We
find that the detection probability is generally maximized for I-band
observations. The signal-to-noise ratio of a planetary transit is weakly
dependent on the mass of the primary for sources with flux above the sky
background, and falls very sharply for sources below sky. Therefore the number
of detectable planets is roughly proportional to the number of stars with
fluxes above sky (and not necessarily the number of sources with photometric
error less a given threshold). In order to maximize the number of detections,
experiments should be tailored such that stars near sky are above the detection
threshold. Once this requirement is met, the number of detected planets is
relatively weakly dependent on the detection threshold, diameter of the
telescope, exposure time, seeing, age of the system, and planet radius. The
number of detected planets is a strongly decreasing function of the distance to
the system, implying that the nearest, richest clusters may prove to be optimal
targets.",2005-04-06T20:01:46Z
Confined and ejective eruptions of kink-unstable flux ropes,"The ideal helical kink instability of a force-free coronal magnetic flux
rope, anchored in the photosphere, is studied as a model for solar eruptions.
Using the flux rope model of Titov & Demoulin (1999} as the initial condition
in MHD simulations, both the development of helical shape and the rise profile
of a confined (or failed) filament eruption (on 2002 May 27) are reproduced in
very good agreement with the observations. By modifying the model such that the
magnetic field decreases more rapidly with height above the flux rope, a full
(or ejective) eruption of the rope is obtained in very good agreement with the
developing helical shape and the exponential-to-linear rise profile of a fast
coronal mass ejection (CME) (on 2001 May 15). This confirms that the helical
kink instability of a twisted magnetic flux rope can be the mechanism of the
initiation and the initial driver of solar eruptions. The agreement of the
simulations with properties that are characteristic of many eruptions suggests
that they are often triggered by the kink instability. The decrease of the
overlying field with height is a main factor in deciding whether the
instability leads to a confined event or to a CME.",2005-07-28T12:52:22Z
"Advances of plasma diagnostics with high-resolution spectroscopy of
  stellar coronae","X-ray emission from cool stars is an important tracer for stellar activity.
The X-ray luminosity reflects different levels of activity and covers four
orders of magnitude in stars of spectral types M-F. Low spectral resolution
provided by X-ray observations of stellar coronae in the past allowed the
determination of temperature distributions and elemental abundances making use
of atomic databases (listing line emissivities and bremsstrahlung continuum for
a given temperature structure). The new missions XMM-Newton and Chandra carry
X-ray gratings providing sufficient spectral resolution to measure the fluxes
of strategic emission lines. I describe the different approaches applicable to
low-resolution and high-resolution spectra, especially focusing on the new
grating spectra with X-ray lines. From only a few lines it is possible to
determine plasma temperatures and associated densities, to check for any
effects from resonant scattering, and to identify particular abundance
anomalies. Line-based temperature- and density measurements represent only a
fraction of the total plasma, but the pressure environment of different
fractions can be probed simply by selection of specific lines. Selected results
are presented covering all aspects of line-based analyses.",2005-04-06T11:17:01Z
Simulating the outer layers of Procyon A: a comparison with the Sun,"Compared to the Sun, the atmospheric structure and convective flow in Procyon
A exhibit the following characteristics: (1) the highly superadiabatic
transition layer (SAL) is located at much shallower optical depth; it is in a
dynamically active region, and its outer region is located part of the time in
the optically thin atmosphere; (2) the outer region of the SAL moves from an
optically thin region to thick region and back again over a time of 20-30
minutes. This motion, which is driven by the granulation, takes place in a time
approximately half the turnover time of the largest granules; The main reason
for the radically different radiative-convective behaviour in Procyon A
compared to the Sun is the role played by turbulent eddies in determining the
overall flow/thermal structure. The turbulent pressure and turbulent kinetic
energy can exceed 50 % of the local gas pressure (compared to about 10-20 % in
the Sun). The Procyon A simulation thus reveals two distinct timescales - the
autocorrelation time of the vertical velocity and the characteristic timescale
of the SAL which is tied to granulation. Just below the surface the
autocorrelation decay time is about 5 minutes in Procyon A, and the SAL motion
timescale is 20-30 mins. When the SAL penetrates the optically thin region
there are efficient radiative losses and the peak of the SAL is low. We
speculate that these losses damp out the relative amplitudes in luminosity
(temperature fluctuations) compared to velocity (Doppler). Although this will
not affect the frequencies of the peaks in the power spectrum, it will probably
lower the average amplitude of the peaks relative to the noise background.",2005-06-30T21:44:07Z
Inflationary spectra and partially decohered distributions,"It is generally expected that decoherence processes will erase the quantum
properties of the inflationary primordial spectra. However, given the weakness
of gravitational interactions, one might end up with a distribution which is
only partially decohered. Below a certain critical change, we show that the
inflationary distribution retains quantum properties. We identify four of
these: a squeezed spread in some direction of phase space, non-vanishing
off-diagonal matrix elements, and two properties used in quantum optics called
non-$P$-representability and non-separability. The last two are necessary
conditions to violate Bell's inequalities. The critical value above which all
these properties are lost is associated to the `grain' of coherent states. The
corresponding value of the entropy is equal to half the maximal (thermal)
value. Moreover it coincides with the entropy of the effective distribution
obtained by neglecting the decaying modes. By considering backreaction effects,
we also provide an upper bound for this entropy at the onset of the adiabatic
era.",2005-05-18T14:13:05Z
Formation of HD molecules in merging dark matter haloes,"HD molecules can be an important cooling agent of the primordial gas behind
the shock waves originated through mergings of the dark matter haloes at epochs
when first luminous objects were to form. We study the necessary conditions for
the HD cooling to switch on in the low temperature range $T<200$ K. We show
that these conditions are fulfiled in merging haloes with the total (dark
matter and baryon) mass in excess of $M_{\rm cr}\sim 10^7[(1+z)/20]^{-2}\msun$.
Haloes with masses $M>M_{\rm cr}$ may be the sites of low-mass star formation.",2005-05-31T11:28:48Z
The 1st INTEGRAL SPI-ACS Gamma-Ray Burst Catalogue,"We present the sample of gamma-ray bursts detected with the anti-coincidence
shield ACS of the spectrometer SPI on-board INTEGRAL for the first 26.5 months
of mission operation (up to Jan 2005). SPI-ACS works as a nearly
omnidirectional gamma-ray burst detector above ~80 keV but lacks spatial and
spectral information. In this catalogue, the properties derived from the 50 ms
light curves (e.g., T90, Cmax, Cint, variability, V/Vmax) are given for each
candidate burst in the sample. A strong excess of very short events with
durations <0.25 s is found. This population is shown to be significantly
different from the short- and long-duration burst sample by means of the
intensity distribution and V/Vmax test and is certainly connected with cosmic
ray hits in the detector. A rate of 0.3 true gamma-ray bursts per day is
observed.",2005-04-15T18:22:44Z
A Simple and Accurate Model for Intra-Cluster Gas,"Starting with the well-known NFW dark matter halo distribution, we construct
a simple polytropic model for the intracluster medium which is in good
agreement with high resolution numerical hydrodynamical simulations, apply this
model to a very large scale concordance dark matter simulation, and compare the
resulting global properties with recent observations of X-ray clusters,
including the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. We make
allowances for a non-negligible surface pressure, removal of low entropy (short
cooling time) gas, energy injection due to feedback, and for a relativistic
(non-thermal) pressure component. A polytropic index n=5 (Gamma=1.2) provides a
good approximation to the internal gas structure of massive clusters (except in
the very central regions where cooling becomes important), and allows one to
recover the observed M_500-T, L_x-T, and T/n_e^{2/3} ~ T^0.65 relations. Using
these concepts and generalizing this method so that it can be applied to fully
three-dimensional N-body simulations, one can predict the global X-ray and SZE
trends for any specified cosmological model. We find a good fit to observations
when assuming that twelve percent of the initial baryonic mass condenses into
stars, the fraction of rest mass of this condensed component transferred back
to the remaining gas (feedback) is 3.9E-5, and the fraction of total pressure
from a nonthermal component is near ten percent.",2005-04-14T21:16:42Z

inelastic interaction of the incoming nucleus. The fine granularity (1 cm) of

properties are presented.",2005-07-21T15:18:21Z
"The FWHM of local pulses and the corresponding power-law index of
  gamma-ray burst FRED pulses","The FWHM of gamma-ray burst (GRB) pulses is known to be related with energy
by a power-law. We wonder if the power-law index $\alpha$ is related with the
corresponding local pulse width $FWHM_0$. Seven FRED (fast rise and exponential
decay) pulse GRBs are employed to study this issue, where six of them were
interpreted recently by the relativistic curvature effect (the Doppler effect
of fireballs) and the corresponding local pulses were intensely studied. A
regression analysis shows an anti-correlation between $log \alpha$ and $log
FWHM_0$ with a slope of $-0.37\pm0.13$. This suggests that, for the class of
the GRB pulses which are consequences of the curvature effect, the difference
of the local pulse width might lead to the variation of the power law index,
where the smaller the width the larger the value of $\alpha$. Since the number
of sources employed in this analysis is small, our result is only a preliminary
one which needs to be confirmed by larger samples.",2005-05-14T15:19:47Z
Encounters between spherical galaxies II: systems with dark halo,"We performe N-body simulations of encounters between spherical systems
surrounded by a spherical halo. Following a preceding paper with a similar aim,
the initial systems include a spherical Jaffe model for the luminous matter and
a Hernquist model for the halo. The merger remnants from this sample are mainly
slowly rotating, prolate spheroids with a radially anisotropic velocity
distribution. The results are compared with real-life ellipticals and with the
models without halo in paper I. We argue that elliptical galaxies with evidence
of dark matter could be formed in the field via a merger of spheroids
surrounded by a dark matter halo, while ellipticals with no evidence of dark
matter might be formed via a merger of two spheroids in a cluster.",2005-06-01T15:09:35Z

associated with the Compact Steep Spectrum radio loud quasar 3C 186
(Q0740+380). Diffuse X-ray emission is detected out to ~120 kpc from the quasar
and contains 741+/-40 net counts. The X-ray spectrum of the extended emission
shows strong Fe-line emission (EW=412eV) at the quasar redshift and confirms
the thermal nature of this diffuse component. We measure a cluster temperature
of 5.2(+1.2/-0.9) keV and an X-ray luminosity L(0.5-2 keV) ~ 6e44 erg/sec,
which are in agreement with the luminosity-temperature relation for
high-redshift clusters. This is the first detection of a bright X-ray cluster
around a luminous (L_bol ~1e47 erg/sec) CSS quasar at high redshift and only
the fifth z>1 X-ray cluster detected. We find that the CSS radio source is
highly overpressured with respect to the thermal cluster medium by about 3
orders of magnitude. This provides direct observational evidence that the radio
source is not thermally confined as posited in the ``frustrated'' scenario for
CSS sources. Instead, it appears that the radio source may be young and we are
observing it at an early stage of its evolution. In that case the radio source
could supply the energy into the cluster and potentially prevent its cooling.",2005-06-16T19:08:44Z

"A Measurement of the Quadrupole Power Spectrum in the Clustering of the
  2dF QSO Survey","We report a measurement of the quadrupole power spectrum in the two degree
field (2dF) QSO redshift (2QZ) survey. The analysis uses an algorithm parallel
to that for the estimation of the standard monopole power spectrum without
first requiring computation of the correlation function or the anisotropic
power spectrum. The error on the quadrupole spectrum is rather large but the
best fit value of the bias parameter from the quadrupole spectrum is consistent
with that from previous investigations of the 2dF data.",2005-05-06T07:00:35Z
Stellar evolutionary models: uncertainties and systematics,"In this last decade, our knowledge of evolutionary and structural properties
of stars of different mass and chemical composition is significantly improved.
This result has been achieved as a consequence of our improved capability in
understanding and describing the physical behavior of stellar matter in the
different thermal regimes characteristic of the different stellar mass ranges
and/or evolutionary stages. This notwithstanding, current generation of stellar
models is still affected by significant and, usually, not negligible
uncertainties. These uncertainties are related to our poor knowledge of some
physical procceses occurring in the real stars such as, for instance, some
thermodynamical processes, nuclear reaction rates, as well as the efficiency of
mixing processes. These drawbacks of stellar models have to be properly taken
into account when comparing theory with observations in order to derive
relevant information about the properties of both resolved and unresolved
stellar populations. In this paper we review current uncertainties affecting
low-mass stellar models, i.e. those structures with mass in the range between
0.6Mo and 1.4Mo. We show what are the main sources of uncertainty along the
main evolutionary stages, and discuss the present level of agreement between
theory and observations concerning some selected features of the
Color-Magnitude Diagram of low-mass stars.",2005-06-08T08:15:49Z
"Multicolour photometry of Balloon 090100001: linking the two classes of
  pulsating hot subdwarfs","We present results of the multicolour UBVR photometry of the high-amplitude
EC14026-type star, Balloon 090100001. The data span over a month and consist of
more than a hundred hours of observations. Fourier analysis of these data led
us to the detection of at least 30 modes of pulsation of which 22 are
independent. The frequencies of 13 detected modes group in three narrow ranges,
around 2.8, 3.8 and 4.7 mHz, where the radial fundamental mode, the first and
second overtones are likely to occur. Surprisingly, we also detect 9
independent modes in the low-frequency domain, between 0.15 and 0.4 mHz. These
modes are typical for pulsations found in PG1716+426-type stars, discovered
recently among cool B-type subdwarfs. The modes found in these stars are
attributed to the high-order g modes. As both kinds of pulsations are observed
in Balloon 090100001, it represents a link between the two classes of pulsating
hot subdwarfs. At present, it is probably the most suitable target for testing
evolutionary scenarios and internal constitution models of these stars by means
of asteroseismology.
  Three of the modes we discovered form an equidistant frequency triplet which
can be explained by invoking rotational splitting of an $\ell$ = 1 mode. The
splitting amounts to about 1.58 $\mu$Hz, leading to a rotation period of 7.1
$\pm$ 0.1 days.",2005-04-03T22:09:38Z
"Kinematic Properties and Stellar Populations of Faint Early-Type
  Galaxies. I. Velocity Dispersion Measurements of Central Coma Galaxies","We present velocity dispersion measurements for 69 faint early-type galaxies
in the core of the Coma cluster, spanning -22.0<M_R<-17.5 mag. We examine the
L-\sigma relation for our sample and compare it to that of bright ellipticals
from the literature. The distribution of the the faint early-type galaxies in
the L-sigma plane follows the relation L ~ \sigma^{2.01\pm0.36}, which is
significantly shallower from L ~ \sigma^4 as defined for the bright
ellipticals. While increased rotational support for fainter early-type galaxies
could account for some of the difference in slope, we show that it cannot
explain it. We also investigate the Colour-\sigma relation for our Coma
galaxies. Using the scatter in this relation, we constrain the range of galaxy
ages as a function of their formation epoch for different formation scenarios.
Assuming a strong coordination in the formation epoch of faint early-type
systems in Coma, we find that most had to be formed at least 6 Gyrs ago and
over a short 1 Gyr period.",2005-06-22T01:32:11Z
"Multiwavelength Monitoring of the Dwarf Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 4395. I. A
  Reverberation-Based Measurement of the Black Hole Mass","A reverberation-mapping program on NGC 4395, the least-luminous known Seyfert
1 galaxy, undertaken with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the
Hubble Space Telescope, yields a measurement of the mass of the central black
hole of 360,000 solar masses. The observations consist of two visits of 5
orbits each, in 2004 April and July. During each of these visits, the UV
continuum varied by at least 10% (rms) and only C IV 1549 showed corresponding
variations large enough to reliably determine the emission-line lag, which was
measured to be of order one hour for both visits. The size of the C IV-emitting
region is about a factor of three smaller than expected if the slope of the
broad-line region radius-luminosity relationship is identical to that for the
H-beta emission line. NGC 4395 is underluminous even for its small black hole
mass; the Eddington ratio of 0.0012 is lower than that of any other active
galactic nucleus for which a black hole mass measurement has been made by
emission-line reverberation.",2005-06-27T20:10:50Z
"The Circumstellar Environment of High Mass Protostellar Objects. III
  Evidence of Infall?","The results are presented of a molecular line survey to search for the
spectral signature of infall towards 77 850 micron continuum sources believed
to be candidate high mass protostellar objects. Up to six different
transitions, HCO+ 1-0, 3-2 and 4-3, H2CO 2_12-1_11, N2H+ and H13CO+ 3-2, were
observed towards each source. Towards the peak of the 850 micron emission, N2H+
was typically strong, with a peak antenna temperature of ~1.5K, with a typical
linewidth of ~2km/s. The good agreement between the velocity and velocity width
of the N2H+ and H13CO+ emission suggests that both species are tracing similar
material in the sources. With respect to the velocity of the N2H+, there is a
statistically significant excess of blue asymmetric line profiles in both the
HCO+ 1-0 and H2CO transitions. This excess reaches levels similar to that seen
towards samples of low mass protostars, and suggests that the material around
these high mass sources is infalling. We identify 22 promising candidate infall
sources which show at least one blue asymmetric line profile and no red
asymmetric profiles. The infall velocity is estimated to be in the range of 0.1
km/s to 1 km/s with an implied mass accretion rate of between 2x10^{-4} Msol/yr
and 10^{-3}Msol/yr.",2005-08-03T09:01:42Z
Models for the soft X-ray emission of post-outburst classical novae,"A hydrostatic and stationary white dwarf envelope model has been developed
for the study of the post-outburst phases of classical novae and their soft
X-ray emission. Several white dwarf masses and chemical compositions typical
for classical novae have been considered. The results show that the luminosity,
maximum effective temperature and envelope masses depend on the white dwarf
mass and on the chemical composition. Envelope masses for which equilibrium
solutions exist are pretty small ~10^{-7}-10^{-6} Msun, thus leading to a short
duration of the soft X-ray emitting phase of classical novae, in agreement with
most of the observations. The models presented provide a useful tool for the
determination of the white dwarf properties from observable parameters in the
X-ray range.",2005-04-15T15:44:43Z
