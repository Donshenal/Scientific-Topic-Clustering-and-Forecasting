Title,Abstract,Published Date
"Electronic structure and magnetism in the frustrated antiferromagnet
  LiCrO2","LiCrO2 is a 2D triangular antiferromagnet, isostructural with the common
battery material LiCoO2 and a well-known Jahn-Teller antiferromagnet NaNiO2. As
opposed to the latter, LiCrO2 exibits antiferromagnetic exchange in Cr planes,
which has been ascribed to direct Cr-Cr d-d overlap. Using LDA and LDA+U first
principles calculations I confirm this conjecture and show that (a) direct d-d
overlap is indeed enhanced compared to isostructural Ni and Cr compounds, (b)
p-d charge transfer gap is also enhanced, thus suppressing the ferromagnetic
superexchange, (c) the calculated magnetic Hamiltonian maps well onto the
nearest neighbors Heisenberg exchange model and (d) interplanar inteaction is
antiferromagnetic.",2007-01-22T15:20:10Z
The Star Formation History in a SMC field: IAC-star/IAC-pop at work,"We present a progress report of a project to study the quantitative star
formation history (SFH) in different parts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).
We use the information in [(B-R), R] color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), which
reach down to the oldest main-sequence turnoffs and allow us to retrieve the
SFH in detail. We show the first results of the SFH in a SMC field located in
the Southern direction (at $\thicksim$1 kpc from the SMC center). This field is
particularly interesting because in spite of being located in a place in which
the HI column density is very low, it still presents a recent enhancement of
star formation.",2007-03-09T21:07:20Z
Adaptive Alternating Minimization Algorithms,"The classical alternating minimization (or projection) algorithm has been
successful in the context of solving optimization problems over two variables.
The iterative nature and simplicity of the algorithm has led to its application
to many areas such as signal processing, information theory, control, and
finance. A general set of sufficient conditions for the convergence and
correctness of the algorithm is quite well-known when the underlying problem
parameters are fixed. In many practical situations, however, the underlying
problem parameters are changing over time, and the use of an adaptive algorithm
is more appropriate. In this paper, we study such an adaptive version of the
alternating minimization algorithm. As a main result of this paper, we provide
a general set of sufficient conditions for the convergence and correctness of
the adaptive algorithm. Perhaps surprisingly, these conditions seem to be the
minimal ones one would expect in such an adaptive setting. We present
applications of our results to adaptive decomposition of mixtures, adaptive
log-optimal portfolio selection, and adaptive filter design.",2007-01-08T18:41:38Z
Spin generation away from boundaries by nonlinear transport,"In several situations of interest, spin polarization may be generated far
from the boundaries of a sample by nonlinear effects of an electric current,
even when such a generation is forbidden by symmetry in the linear regime. We
present an analytically solvable model where spin accumulation results from a
combination of current gradients, nonlinearity, and cubic anisotropy. Further,
we show that even with isotropic conductivity, nonlinear effects in a low
symmetry geometry can generate spin polarization far away from boundaries.
Finally, we find that drift from the boundaries results in spin polarization
patterns that dominate in recent experiments on GaAs by Sih et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 97, 096605 (2006)].",2007-03-25T20:36:34Z
"General relativity, gravitational energy and spin-two field","In my lectures I will deal with three seemingly unrelated problems: i) to
what extent is general relativity exceptional among metric gravity theories?
ii) is it possible to define gravitational energy density applying field-theory
approach to gravity? and iii) can a consistent theory of a gravitationally
interacting spin-two field be developed at all? The connecting link to them is
the concept of a fundamental spin-2 field. A linear spin-2 field encounters
insurmountable inconsistencies when coupled to gravity. After discussing the
inconsistencies of any coupling of the linear spin-2 field to gravity, I
exhibit the origin of the fact that a gauge invariant field has the variational
metric stress tensor which is gauge dependent. I give a general theorem
explaining under what conditions a symmetry of a field Lagrangian becomes also
the symmetry of the stress tensor. It is a conclusion of the theorem that any
attempt to define gravitational energy density in the framework of a field
theory of gravity must fail. Finally I make a very brief introduction to basic
concepts of how a certain kind of a necessarily nonlinear spin-2 field arises
in a natural way from vacuum higher derivative gravity theories. This specific
spin-2 field consistently interacts gravitationally.",2007-01-29T11:36:08Z
"Heteropolymer Sequence Design and Preferential Solvation of Hydrophilic
  Monomers: One More Application of Random Energy Model","In this paper, we study the role of surface of the globule and the role of
interactions with the solvent for designed sequence heteropolymers using random
energy model (REM). We investigate the ground state energy and surface monomer
composition distribution. By comparing the freezing transition in random and
designed sequence heteropolymers, we discuss the effects of design. Based on
our results, we are able to show under which conditions solvation effect
improves the quality of sequence design. Finally, we study sequence space
entropy and discuss the number of available sequences as a function of imposed
requirements for the design quality.",2007-01-24T04:43:59Z
"Recent advances in the internal functionalization of carbon nanotubes:
  synthesis, optical, and magnetic resonance studies","The hollow inside of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) provides a unique
degree of freedom to investigate chemical reactions inside this confined
environment and to study the tube properties. It is reviewed herein, how
encapsulating fullerenes, magnetic fullerenes, $^{13}$C isotope enriched
fullerenes and organic solvents inside SWCNTs enables to yield unprecedented
insight into their electronic, optical, and interfacial properties and to study
their growth. Encapsulated C$_{60}$ fullerenes are transformed to inner tubes
by a high temperature annealing. The unique, low defect concentration of inner
tubes makes them ideal to study the effect of diameter dependent treatments
such as opening and closing of the tubes. The growth of inner tubes is achieved
from $^{13}$C enriched encapsulated organic solvents, which shows that
fullerenes do not have a distinguished role and it opens new perspectives to
explore the in-the-tube chemistry. Encapsulation of magnetic fullerenes, such
as N@C$_{60}$ and C$_{59}$N is demonstrated using ESR. Growth of inner tubes
from $^{13}$C enriched fullerenes provides a unique isotope engineered
heteronuclear system, where the outer tubes contain natural carbon and the
inner walls are controllably $^{13}$C isotope enriched. The material enables to
identify the vibrational modes of inner tubes which otherwise strongly overlap
with the outer tube modes. The $^{13}$C NMR signal of the material is specific
for the small diameter SWCNTs. Temperature and field dependent $^{13}$C $T_1$
studies show a uniform metallic-like electronic state for all inner tubes and a
low energy, ~3 meV gap is observed that is assigned to a long sought Peierls
transition.",2007-01-31T20:37:30Z
"Microscopic annealing process and its impact on superconductivity in
  T'-structure electron-doped copper oxides","High-transition-temperature superconductivity arises in copper oxides when
holes or electrons are doped into the CuO2 planes of their insulating parent
compounds. While hole-doping quickly induces metallic behavior and
superconductivity in many cuprates, electron-doping alone is insufficient in
materials such as R2CuO4 (R is Nd, Pr, La, Ce, etc.), where it is necessary to
anneal an as-grown sample in a low-oxygen environment to remove a tiny amount
of oxygen in order to induce superconductivity. Here we show that the
microscopic process of oxygen reduction repairs Cu deficiencies in the as-grown
materials and creates oxygen vacancies in the stoichiometric CuO2 planes,
effectively reducing disorder and providing itinerant carriers for
superconductivity. The resolution of this long-standing materials issue
suggests that the fundamental mechanism for superconductivity is the same for
electron- and hole-doped copper oxides.",2007-01-15T18:34:37Z
Distribution of Microscopic Energy Flux in Equilibrium State,"The distribution function P(j) of the microscopic energy flux, j, in
equilibrium state is studied. It is observed that P(j) has a broad peak in
small j regime and a stretched-exponential decay for large j. The peak
structure originates in a potential advection term and energy transfer term
between the particles. The stretched exponential tail comes from the momentum
energy advection term.",2007-02-27T09:30:36Z
"A lyotropic ferrocolloid (ferronematic) based on a potassium
  laurate/1-decanole/water ternary solution","A lyotropic ferrocolloid is synthesized by mixing of a cationic ferrofluid
and potassium laurate/1-decanol/water ternary solution. Conditions of existence
of a nematic phase in this mixture, other mesophases, and their phase diagrams
in the vicinity of the nematic one are obtained and characterized
quantitatively. Inside of the nematic zone the lyotropic ferrocolloid becomes a
ferronematic, i.e., a liquid crystal with remarkably strong magnetic
properties. We found that the pH and the component concentrations dramatically
affect the amount of magnetic particles stably suspended in a lyotropic
carrier. Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of synthesized ferronematics
are measured depending on the concentration of dispersed magnetic particles.",2007-03-21T04:47:54Z
On the Hydrodynamic Boundary Condition for Superfluid Flow,"We discuss the hydrodynamic boundary condition for a superfluid moving
tangentially to a rough surface. Specifically, we argue that the scattering of
quantum fluctuations off surface roughness affects the nature of the boundary
condition, and that this has important consequences including a new theorized
critical speed and the presence of normal fluid at any nonzero speed, even if
the boundary is held at zero temperature. This hydrodynamic boundary condition
is relevant not only for superfluid helium experiments but also for experiments
with trapped dilute Bose-Einstein condensates, in particular those involving
atomic waveguides near surfaces.",2007-02-28T02:50:34Z
The Geminga Fraction,"Radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars like Geminga may account for a number of the
unidentified EGRET sources in the Galaxy. The number of Geminga-like pulsars is
very sensitive to the geometry of both the gamma-ray and radio beams. Recent
studies of the shape and polarization of pulse profiles of young radio pulsars
have provided evidence that their radio emission originates in wide cone beams
at altitudes that are a significant fraction (1 -10%) of their light cylinder
radius. Such wide radio emission beams will be visible at a much larger range
of observer angles than the narrow core components thought to originate at
lower altitude. Using 3D geometrical modeling that includes relativistic
effects from pulsar rotation, we study the visibility of such radio cone beams
as well as that of the gamma-ray beams predicted by slot gap and outer gap
models. From the results of this study one can obtain revised predictions for
the fraction of Geminga-like, radio quiet pulsars present in the gamma-ray
pulsar population.",2007-03-01T16:14:23Z
"Correlation effects in partially ionized mass asymmetric electron-hole
  plasmas","The effects of strong Coulomb correlations in dense three-dimensional
electron-hole plasmas are studied by means of unbiased direct path integral
Monte Carlo simulations. The formation and dissociation of bound states, such
as excitons and bi-excitons is analyzed and the density-temperature region of
their appearance is identified. At high density, the Mott transition to the
fully ionized metallic state (electron-hole liquid) is detected. Particular
attention is paid to the influence of the hole to electron mass ratio $M$ on
the properties of the plasma. Above a critical value of about M=80 formation of
a hole Coulomb crystal was recently verified [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95}, 235006
(2005)] which is supported by additional results. Results are related to the
excitonic phase diagram of intermediate valent Tm[Se,Te], where large values of
$M$ have been observed experimentally.",2007-02-02T17:37:17Z
"Phenomenological theory of phase transitions in epitaxial BaTiO3 thin
  films","We develop a phenomenological thermodynamic theory of ferroelectric BaTiO3
(BT) thin films epitaxially grown on cubic substrates using the
Landau-Devonshire eight-order potential. The constructed ""misfit-temperature""
phase diagram is asymmetrical. We found that, overall view of the phase diagram
depends on the values of compliances used in calculations and provide two
qualitatively different diagrams. A thermodynamic path for BT film grown onto
particular substrate can be found using a plot of the room-temperature
tetragonal distortion (c-a)/a as a function of misfit strain.",2007-03-16T13:46:17Z
"Valence bond solids for SU(n) spin chains: exact models, spinon
  confinement, and the Haldane gap","To begin with, we introduce several exact models for SU(3) spin chains: (1) a
translationally invariant parent Hamiltonian involving four-site interactions
for the trimer chain, with a three-fold degenerate ground state. We provide
numerical evidence that the elementary excitations of this model transform
under representation 3bar of SU(3) if the original spins of the model transform
under rep. 3. (2) a family of parent Hamiltonians for valence bond solids of
SU(3) chains with spin reps. 6, 10, and 8 on each lattice site. We argue that
of these three models, only the latter two exhibit spinon confinement and hence
a Haldane gap in the excitation spectrum. We generalize some of our models to
SU(n). Finally, we use the emerging rules for the construction of VBS states to
argue that models of antiferromagnetic chains of SU(n) spins in general possess
a Haldane gap if the spins transform under a representation corresponding to a
Young tableau consisting of a number of boxes \lambda which is divisible by n.
If \lambda and n have no common divisor, the spin chain will support deconfined
spinons and not exhibit a Haldane gap. If \lambda and n have a common divisor
different from n, it will depend on the specifics of the model including the
range of the interaction.",2007-02-19T17:13:52Z
Holonomic constraints : an analytical result,"Systems subjected to holonomic constraints follow quite complicated dynamics
that could not be described easily with Hamiltonian or Lagrangian dynamics. The
influence of holonomic constraints in equations of motions is taken into
account by using Lagrange multipliers. Finding the value of the Lagrange
multipliers allows to compute the forces induced by the constraints and
therefore, to integrate the equations of motions of the system. Computing
analytically the Lagrange multipliers for a constrained system may be a
difficult task that is depending on the complexity of systems. For complex
systems, it is most of the time impossible to achieve. In computer simulations,
some algorithms using iterative procedures estimate numerically Lagrange
multipliers or constraint forces by correcting the unconstrained trajectory. In
this work, we provide an analytical computation of the Lagrange multipliers for
a set of linear holonomic constraints with an arbitrary number of bonds of
constant length. In the appendix of the paper, one would find explicit formulas
for Lagrange multipliers for systems having 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 bonds of constant
length, linearly connected.",2007-01-10T19:25:45Z
"Bergmann-Thomson energy-momentum complex for solutions more general than
  the Kerr-Schild class","In a very well-known paper, Virbhadra's research group proved that the
Weinberg, Papapetrou, Landau and Lifshitz, and Einstein energy-momentum
complexes ``coincide'' for all metrics of Kerr-Schild class. A few years later,
Virbhadra clarified that this ``coincidence'' in fact holds for metrics more
general than the Kerr-Schild class. In the present paper, this study is
extended for the Bergmann-Thomson complex and it is proved that this complex
also ``coincides'' with those complexes for a more general than the Kerr-Schild
class metric.",2007-02-12T15:21:41Z
"A variational analysis of Einstein-scalar field Lichnerowicz equations
  on compact Riemannian manifolds","We establish new existence and non-existence results for positive solutions
of the Einstein-scalar field Lichnerowicz equation on compact manifolds. This
equation arises from the Hamiltonian constraint equation for the
Einstein-scalar field system in general relativity. Our analysis introduces
variational techniques, in the form of the mountain pass lemma, to the analysis
of the Hamiltonian constraint equation, which has been previously studied by
other methods.",2007-02-05T22:35:23Z
Satisfying assignments of Random Boolean CSP: Clusters and Overlaps,"The distribution of overlaps of solutions of a random CSP is an indicator of
the overall geometry of its solution space. For random $k$-SAT, nonrigorous
methods from Statistical Physics support the validity of the ``one step replica
symmetry breaking'' approach. Some of these predictions were rigorously
confirmed in \cite{cond-mat/0504070/prl} \cite{cond-mat/0506053}. There it is
proved that the overlap distribution of random $k$-SAT, $k\geq 9$, has
discontinuous support. Furthermore, Achlioptas and Ricci-Tersenghi proved that,
for random $k$-SAT, $k\geq 8$. and constraint densities close enough to the
phase transition there exists an exponential number of clusters of satisfying
assignments; moreover, the distance between satisfying assignments in different
clusters is linear.
  We aim to understand the structural properties of random CSP that lead to
solution clustering. To this end, we prove two results on the cluster structure
of solutions for binary CSP under the random model from Molloy (STOC 2002)
  1. For all constraint sets $S$ (described explicitly in Creignou and Daude
(2004), Istrate (2005)) s.t. $SAT(S)$ has a sharp threshold and all $q\in
(0,1]$, $q$-overlap-$SAT(S)$ has a sharp threshold (i.e. the first step of the
approach in Mora et al. works in all nontrivial cases). 2. For any constraint
density value $c<1$, the set of solutions of a random instance of 2-SAT form,
w.h.p., a single cluster. Also, for and any $q\in (0,1]$ such an instance has
w.h.p. two satisfying assignment of overlap $\sim q$. Thus, as expected from
Statistical Physics predictions, the second step of the approach in Mora et al.
fails for 2-SAT.",2007-03-13T15:45:08Z
On the Stability of a class of Modified Gravitational Models,"Motivated by the dark energy issue, a minisuperspace approach to the
stability for modified gravitational models in a four dimensional cosmological
setting are investigated. Specifically, after revisiting the $f(R)$ case, $R$
being the Ricci curvature, we present a stability condition around a de Sitter
solution valid for modified gravitational models of generalized Gauss-Bonnet
type $F(R,G,Q)$, $G$ and $Q$ being the Gauss-Bonnet and quadratic Riemann
invariants respectively. A generalization to higher order invariants is
mentioned.",2007-01-25T10:03:35Z
Spin-dependent Rotating Wigner Molecules in Quantum dots,"The spin-dependent trial wave functions with rotational symmetry are
introduced to describe rotating Wigner molecular states with spin degree of
freedom in four- and five-electron quantum dots under magnetic fields. The
functions are constructed with unrestricted Hartree-Fock orbits and projection
technique in long-range interaction limit. They highly overlap with the
exact-diagonalized ones and give the accurate energies in strong fields. The
zero points, i.e. vortices of the functions have straightforward relations to
the angular momenta of the states. The functions with different total spins
automatically satisfy the angular momentum transition rules with the increase
of magnetic fields and explicitly show magnetic couplings and characteristic
oscillations with respect to the angular momenta. Based on the functions, it is
demonstrated that the entanglement entropies of electrons depend on the
z-component of total spin and rise with the increase of angular momenta.",2007-02-10T10:49:06Z
Scaling theory of transport in complex networks,"Transport is an important function in many network systems and understanding
its behavior on biological, social, and technological networks is crucial for a
wide range of applications. However, it is a property that is not
well-understood in these systems and this is probably due to the lack of a
general theoretical framework. Here, based on the finding that renormalization
can be applied to bio-networks, we develop a scaling theory of transport in
self-similar networks. We demonstrate the networks invariance under length
scale renormalization and we show that the problem of transport can be
characterized in terms of a set of critical exponents. The scaling theory
allows us to determine the influence of the modular structure on transport. We
also generalize our theory by presenting and verifying scaling arguments for
the dependence of transport on microscopic features, such as the degree of the
nodes and the distance between them. Using transport concepts such as diffusion
and resistance we exploit this invariance and we are able to explain, based on
the topology of the network, recent experimental results on the broad flow
distribution in metabolic networks.",2007-02-06T16:28:12Z
"A Simplified Suspension Calculus and its Relationship to Other Explicit
  Substitution Calculi","This paper concerns the explicit treatment of substitutions in the lambda
calculus. One of its contributions is the simplification and rationalization of
the suspension calculus that embodies such a treatment. The earlier version of
this calculus provides a cumbersome encoding of substitution composition, an
operation that is important to the efficient realization of reduction. This
encoding is simplified here, resulting in a treatment that is easy to use
directly in applications. The rationalization consists of the elimination of a
practically inconsequential flexibility in the unravelling of substitutions
that has the inadvertent side effect of losing contextual information in terms;
the modified calculus now has a structure that naturally supports logical
analyses, such as ones related to the assignment of types, over lambda terms.
The overall calculus is shown to have pleasing theoretical properties such as a
strongly terminating sub-calculus for substitution and confluence even in the
presence of term meta variables that are accorded a grafting interpretation.
Another contribution of the paper is the identification of a broad set of
properties that are desirable for explicit substitution calculi to support and
a classification of a variety of proposed systems based on these. The
suspension calculus is used as a tool in this study. In particular, mappings
are described between it and the other calculi towards understanding the
characteristics of the latter.",2007-02-26T02:16:57Z
Spin transverse force and quantum transverse transport,"We present a brief review on spin transverse force, which exerts on the spin
as the electron is moving in an electric field. This force, analogue to the
Lorentz force on electron charge, is perpendicular to the electric field and
spin current carried by the electron. The force stems from the spin-orbit
coupling of electrons as a relativistic quantum effect, and could be used to
understand the Zitterbewegung of electron wave packet and the quantum
transverse transport of electron in a heuristic way.",2007-03-08T04:22:10Z
"Large Magnetoresistance in Co/Ni/Co Ferromagnetic Single Electron
  Transistors","We report on magnetotransport investigations of nano-scaled ferromagnetic
Co/Ni/Co single electron transistors. As a result of reduced size, the devices
exhibit single electron transistor characteristics at 4.2K. Magnetotransport
measurements carried out at 1.8K reveal tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR)
traces with negative coercive fields, which we interpret in terms of a
switching mechanism driven by the shape anisotropy of the central wire-like Ni
island. A large TMR of about 18% is observed within a finite source-drain bias
regime. The TMR decreases rapidly with increasing bias, which we tentatively
attribute to excitation of magnons in the central island.",2007-02-15T17:07:10Z
"Information Loss as a Foundational Principle for the Second Law of
  Thermodynamics","In a previous paper [1] we considered the question, ""What underlying property
of nature is responsible for the second law?"" A simple answer can be stated in
terms of information: The fundamental loss of information gives rise to the
second law. This line of thinking highlights the existence of two independent
but coupled sets of laws: Information dynamics and energy dynamics. The
distinction helps shed light on certain foundational questions in statistical
mechanics. For example, the confusion surrounding previous ""derivations"" of the
second law from energy dynamics can be resolved by noting that such derivations
incorporate one or more assumptions that correspond to the loss of information.
In this paper we further develop and explore the perspective in which the
second law is fundamentally a law of information dynamics.",2007-03-09T01:39:57Z
"Anomalous field effect and glassy behaviour in granular aluminium thin
  films: electron glass?","We present a study of non-equilibrium phenomena observed in the electrical
conductance of insulating granular aluminium thin films. An anomalous field
effect and its slow relaxation are studied in some detail. The phenomenology is
very similar to the one already observed in indium oxide. The origin of the
phenomena is discussed. In granular systems, the present experiments can
naturally be interpreted along two different lines. One relies on a slow
polarisation in the dielectric surrounding the metallic islands. The other one
relies on a purely electronic mechanism: the formation of an electron Coulomb
glass in the granular metal. More selective experiments and/or quantitative
predictions about the Coulomb glass properties are still needed to definitely
distinguish between the two scenarii.",2007-01-23T17:19:54Z
"Renormalized charge in a two-dimensional model of colloidal suspension
  from hypernetted chain approach","The renormalized charge of a simple two-dimensional model of colloidal
suspension was determined by solving the hypernetted chain approximation and
Ornstein-Zernike equations. At the infinite dilution limit, the asymptotic
behavior of the correlations functions is used to define the effective
interactions between the components of the system and these effective
interactions were compared to those derived from the Poisson-Boltzmann theory.
The results we obtained show that, in contrast to the mean-field theory, the
renormalized charge does not saturate, but exhibits a maximum value and then
decays monotonically as the bare charge increases. The results also suggest
that beyond the counterion layer near to the macroion surface, the ionic cloud
is not a diffuse layer which can be handled by means of the linearized theory,
as the two-state model claims, but a more complex structure is settled by the
correlations between microions.",2007-02-02T21:17:19Z
"Electronic structure of epitaxial graphene layers on SiC: effect of the
  substrate","Recent transport measurements on thin graphite films grown on SiC show large
coherence lengths and anomalous integer quantum Hall effects expected for
isolated graphene sheets. This is the case eventhough the layer-substrate
epitaxy of these films implies a strong interface bond that should induce
perturbations in the graphene electronic structure. Our DFT calculations
confirm this strong substrate-graphite bond in the first adsorbed carbon layer
that prevents any graphitic electronic properties for this layer. However, the
graphitic nature of the film is recovered by the second and third absorbed
layers. This effect is seen in both the (0001)and $(000\bar{1})$ 4H SiC
surfaces. We also present evidence of a charge transfer that depends on the
interface geometry. It causes the graphene to be doped and gives rise to a gap
opening at the Dirac point after 3 carbon layers are deposited in agreement
with recent ARPES experiments (T.Ohta et al, Science {\bf 313} (2006) 951).",2007-02-13T15:59:36Z
"Nanoscale Smoothing and the Analysis of Interfacial Charge and Dipolar
  Densities","The interface properties of interest in multilayers include interfacial
charge densities, dipole densities, band offsets, and screening-lengths, among
others. Most such properties are inaccesible to direct measurements, but are
key to understanding the physics of the multilayers. They are contained within
first-principles electronic structure computations but are buried within the
vast amount of quantitative information those computations generate. Thus far,
they have been extracted from the numerical data by heuristic nanosmoothing
procedures which do not necessarily provide results independent of the
smoothing process. In the present paper we develop the theory of nanosmoothing,
establishing procedures for both unpolarized and polarized systems which yield
interfacial charge and dipole densities and band offsets invariant to the
details of the smoothing procedures when the criteria we have established are
met. We show also that dipolar charge densities, i. e. the densities of charge
transferred across the interface, and screening lengths are not invariant. We
illustrate our procedure with a toy model in which real, transversely averaged
charge densities are replaced by sums of Gaussians.",2007-01-08T13:50:56Z
"""Waterfalls"" phenomenon in superconducting cuprates","We show that the ""waterfalls"", as reported in recent ARPES studies on HTSC,
can neither be described as a part of a self-consistent quasiparticle spectrum
nor represent a new physical phenomena, namely the ""new energy scale"". They
stem from the critical suppression of the photoemission intensity along the
Brillouin zone (BZ) diagonals. Our arguments, however, do not question the
existence of the high-energy scale itself (~ 0.25 eV), which is a simple
consequence of the renormalization maximum and has been explained earlier in
terms of coupling to a continuum of bosonic excitations. Moreover, when the
matrix-elements are taken into account, it becomes clear that the photoemission
spectrum consists of two components: one represents the spectrum of
one-particle excitations and the other, having a grid-like structure along the
bonding directions in the BZ, is of yet unknown origin.",2007-03-08T19:42:29Z
"A microscopically-based, global landscape perspective on slow dynamics
  in condensed matter","A complete understanding of the precipitous onset of slow dynamics in systems
such as supercooled liquids requires making direct connections between dynamics
and the underlying potential energy landscape. With the aid of a switch in
ensembles, we show that it is possible to formulate a landscape-based mechanism
for the onset of slow dynamics based on the rapid lengthening of the geodesic
paths that traverse the landscape. We confirm the usefulness of this purely
geometric analysis by showing that it successfully predicts the diffusion
constants of a standard model supercooled liquid.",2007-02-08T14:34:08Z
"An analytic expression for the electronic correlation term of the
  kinetic functional","We propose an analytic formula for the non-local Fisher information
functional, or electronic kinetic correlation term, appearing in the expression
of the kinetic density functional. Such an explicit formula is constructed on
the basis of well-founded physical arguments and a rigorous mathematical
prescription.",2007-01-16T14:17:04Z
Thermal Spin-Transfer Torques in Magnetoelectronic Devices,"We predict that the magnetization direction of a ferromagnet can be reversed
by the spin-transfer torque accompanying spin-polarized thermoelectric heat
currents. We illustrate the concept by applying a finite-element theory of
thermoelectric transport in disordered magnetoelectronic circuits and devices
to metallic spin valves. When thermalization is not complete, a spin heat
accumulation vector is found in the normal metal spacer, i.e., a directional
imbalance in the temperature of majority and minority spins.",2007-01-09T06:44:58Z
Quantum vortices in optical lattices,"A vortex in a superfluid gas inside an optical lattice can behave as a
massive particle moving in a periodic potential and exhibiting quantum
properties. In this Letter we discuss these properties and show that the
excitation of vortex motions in a two-dimensional lattice can lead to striking
measurable changes in its dynamic response. It would be possible by means of
Bragg spectroscopy to carry out the first direct measurement of the effective
vortex mass, the pinning to the underlying lattice, and the dissipative
damping.",2007-01-18T09:50:52Z
"Fabrication, optical characterization and modeling of strained
  core-shell nanowires","Strained nanowires with varying InAs/InP core-shell thicknesses were grown
using Chemical Beam Epitaxy. Microphotoluminescence spectroscopy, performed at
low temperature, was then used to study the optical properties of single wires.
Emission from the InAs core was observed and its dependence on the shell
thickness/core diameter ratio was investigated. We found that it is possible to
tune the emission energy towards 0.8 eV by controlling this ratio. We have
compared the measured energies with calculated energies. Our findings are
consistent with the wires having a hexagonal crystal structure.",2007-01-04T18:48:27Z
Keck spectroscopy of z=1-3 ULIRGs from the Spitzer SWIRE survey,"(Abridged) High-redshift ultra luminous infrared galaxies contribute the bulk
of the cosmic IR background and are the best candidates for very massive
galaxies in formation at z>1.5. We present Keck/LRIS optical spectroscopy of 35
z>1.4 luminous IR galaxies in the Spitzer Wide-area Infra-Red Extragalactic
survey (SWIRE) northern fields (Lockman Hole, ELAIS-N1, ELAIS-N2). The primary
targets belong to the ``IR-peak'' class of galaxies, having the 1.6 micron
(restframe) stellar feature detected in the IRAC Spitzer channels.The spectral
energy distributions of the main targets are thoroughly analyzed, by means of
spectro-photometric synthesis and multi-component fits (stars + starburst dust
+ AGN torus). The IR-peak selection technique is confirmed to successfully
select objects above z=1.4, though some of the observed sources lie at lower
redshift than expected. Among the 16 galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, 62%
host an AGN component, two thirds being type-1 and one third type-2 objects.
The selection, limited to r'<24.5, is likely biased to optically-bright AGNs.
The SEDs of non-AGN IR-peakers resemble those of starbursts (SFR=20-500
Msun/yr) hosted in massive (M>1e11 Msun) galaxies. The presence of an AGN
component provides a plausible explanation for the spectroscopic/photometric
redshift discrepancies, as the torus produces an apparent shift of the peak to
longer wavelengths. These sources are analyzed in IRAC and optical-IR color
spaces. In addition to the IR-peak galaxies, we present redshifts and spectral
properties for 150 objects, out of a total of 301 sources on slits.",2007-03-09T18:47:34Z
"Superposition of Quantum and Classical Rotational Motions in Sc2C2@C84
  Fullerite","The superposition of the quantum rotational motion (tunneling) of the
encapsulated Sc2C2 complex with the classical rotational motion of the
surrounding C84 molecule in a powder crystal of Sc2C2@C84 fullerite is
investigated by theory. Since the quantum rotor is dragged along by the C84
molecule, any detection method which couples to the quantum rotor (in casu the
C2 bond of the Sc2C2 complex also probes the thermally excited classical motion
(uniaxial rotational diffusion and stochastic meroaxial jumps) of the
surrounding fullerene. The dynamic rotation-rotation response functions in
frequency space are obtained as convolutions of quantum and classical dynamic
correlation functions. The corresponding Raman scattering laws are derived, the
overall shape of the spectra and the width of the resonance lines are studied
as functions of temperature. The results of the theory are confronted with
experimental low-frequency Raman spectra on powder crystals of Sc2C2@C84 [M.
Krause et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 137403 (2004)]. The agreement of theory
with experiment is very satisfactory in a broad temperature range.",2007-02-26T13:30:46Z
Maximum Entropy in the framework of Algebraic Statistics: A First Step,"Algebraic statistics is a recently evolving field, where one would treat
statistical models as algebraic objects and thereby use tools from
computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry in the analysis and
computation of statistical models. In this approach, calculation of parameters
of statistical models amounts to solving set of polynomial equations in several
variables, for which one can use celebrated Grobner bases theory. Owing to the
important role of information theory in statistics, this paper as a first step,
explores the possibility of describing maximum and minimum entropy (ME) models
in the framework of algebraic statistics. We show that ME-models are toric
models (a class of algebraic statistical models) when the constraint functions
(that provide the information about the underlying random variable) are integer
valued functions, and the set of statistical models that results from
ME-methods are indeed an affine variety.",2007-01-18T15:23:29Z
Condensation in zero-range processes on inhomogeneous networks,"We investigate the role of inhomogeneities in zero-range processes in
condensation dynamics.We consider the dynamics of balls hopping between nodes
of a network, and find that the condensation is triggered by the ratio k_1/k of
the highest degree k_1 to the average degree k. Although the condensate takes
on the average an extensive number of balls, its occupation can oscillate in a
wide range. We show that in systems with strong inhomogeneity, the typical
melting time of the condensate grows exponentially with the number of balls.",2007-03-09T10:57:28Z
"Gold Clusters Sliding on Graphite: a Possible Quartz Crystal
  Microbalance Experiment?","A large measured 2D diffusion coefficient of gold nanoclusters on graphite
has been known experimentally and theoretically for about a decade. When
subjected to a lateral force, these clusters should slide with an amount of
friction that could be measured. We examine the hypothetical possibility to
measure by Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) the phononic sliding friction of
gold clusters in the size range around 250 atoms on a graphite substrate
between 300 and 600 K. Assuming the validity of Einstein's relations of
ordinary Brownian motion and making use of the experimentally available
activated behavior of the diffusion coefficients, we can predict the sliding
friction and slip times as a function of temperature. It is found that a
prototypical deposited gold cluster could yield slip times in the standard
measurable size of 10^(-9) sec for temperatures around 450-500 K, or 200 C.
Since gold nanoclusters may also melt around these temperatures, QCM would
offer the additional chance to observe this phenomenon through a frictional
change.",2007-02-16T12:15:46Z
Signatures of Planet Formation in Gravitationally Unstable Disks,"In this paper, we calculate simulated scattered light images of a
circumstellar disk in which a planet is forming by gravitational instability.
The simulated images bear no correlation to the vertically integrated surface
density of the disk, but rather trace the density structure in the tenuous
upper layers of the disk. Although the density at high altitudes does not bear
a direct relation to activity at the midplane, the very existence of structure
at high altitudes along with high time variability is an indicator of
gravitational instability within the disk. The timescale for variations is much
shorter than the orbital period of the planet, which facilitates observation of
the phenomenon. Scattered light images may not necessarily be able to tell us
where exactly a planet might be forming in a disk, but can still be a useful
probe of active planet formation within a circumstellar disk. Although these
phenomena are unlikely to be observable by current telescopes, future large
telescopes, such as the Giant Magellan Telescope, may be able to detect them.",2007-03-07T21:00:17Z
"Line Shape Broadening in Surface Diffusion of Interacting Adsorbates
  with Quasielastic He Atom Scattering","The experimental line shape broadening observed in adsorbate diffusion on
metal surfaces with increasing coverage is usually related to the nature of the
adsorbate-adsorbate interaction. Here we show that this broadening can also be
understood in terms of a fully stochastic model just considering two noise
sources: (i) a Gaussian white noise accounting for the surface friction, and
(ii) a shot noise replacing the physical adsorbate-adsorbate interaction
potential. Furthermore, contrary to what could be expected, for relatively weak
adsorbate-substrate interactions the opposite effect is predicted: line shapes
get narrower with increasing coverage.",2007-02-08T16:32:32Z
"Interface dependence of the Josephson-current fluctuations in short SNS
  junctions","We discuss the dependence of the Josephson current correlations in mesoscopic
superconductor/normal-conductor/superconductor (SNS) devices on the
transparency of the superconductor/normal-conductor (SN) interfaces. Focusing
on short junctions we apply the supersymmetry method to construct an effective
field theory for mesoscopic SNS devices which is evaluated in the limit of
highly and weakly transparent interfaces. We show that the two-point
Josephson-current correlator differs by an universal factor 2 in these two
cases.",2007-01-30T14:14:39Z
"Coulomb Bubbles: Over-stable Driving of Magnetoacoustic Waves Due to the
  Rapid and Anisotropic Diffusion of Energy","We perform a linear magnetohydrodynamic perturbation analysis for a
stratified magnetized envelope where the diffusion of heat is mediated by
charged particles that are confined to flow along magnetic field lines. We
identify an instability, the ``coulomb bubble instability,'' which may be
thought of as standard magnetosonic fast and slow waves, driven by the rapid
diffusion of heat along the direction of the magnetic field. We calculate the
growth rate and stability criteria for the coulomb bubble instability for
various choices of equilibrium conditions. The coulomb bubble instability is
most strongly driven for weakly magnetized atmospheres that are strongly
convectively stable. We briefly discuss a possible application of astrophysical
interest: diffusion of interstellar cosmic rays in the hot T ~ 10^6 K Galactic
corona. We show that for commonly accepted values of the cosmic ray and gas
pressure as well as its overall characteristic dimensions, the Galactic corona
is in a marginal state of stability with respect to a cosmic ray coulomb bubble
instability. The implication being that a cosmic ray coulomb bubble instability
plays a role regulating both the pressure and transport properties of
interstellar cosmic rays, while serving as a source of acoustic power above the
galactic disk. (abridged)",2007-03-06T19:34:27Z
"Analytical solution of a Hubbard model extended by nearest neighbour
  Coulomb and exchange interaction on a triangle and tetrahedron","The Hubbard model extended by either nearest-neighbour Coulomb correlation
and/or nearest neighbour Heisenberg exchange is solved analytically for a
triangle and tetrahedron. All eigenvalues and eigenvectors are given as
functions of the model parameters in a closed form. The groundstate crossings
and degeneracies are discussed both for the canonical and grand-canonical
energy levels. The grand canonical potential and the electron occupation of the
related cluster gases were calculated for arbitrary values (attractive and
repulsive) of the three interaction constants. In the pure Hubbard model we
found various steps in the electron occupation higher than one. It is shown
that the various degeneracies of the grand-canonical energy levels are
partially lifted by an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas a
moderate ferromagnetic exchange modifies only slightly the results of the pure
Hubbard model. A repulsive nn Coulomb correlation lifts these degeneracies
completely. The relation of the cluster gas results to extended systems is
discussed.",2007-01-04T14:39:26Z
Competition of Fermi surface symmetry breaking and superconductivity,"We analyze a mean-field model of electrons on a square lattice with two types
of interaction: forward scattering favoring a d-wave Pomeranchuk instability
and a BCS pairing interaction driving d-wave superconductivity. Tuning the
interaction parameters a rich variety of phase diagrams is obtained. If the BCS
interaction is not too strong, Fermi surface symmetry breaking is stabilized
around van Hove filling, and coexists with superconductivity at low
temperatures. For pure forward scattering Fermi surface symmetry breaking
occurs typically via a first order transition at low temperatures. The presence
of superconductivity reduces the first order character of this transition and,
if strong enough, can turn it into a continuous one. This gives rise to a
quantum critical point within the superconducting phase. The superconducting
gap tends to suppress Fermi surface symmetry breaking. For a relatively strong
BCS interaction, Fermi surface symmetry breaking can be limited to intermediate
temperatures, or can be suppressed completely by pairing.",2007-01-26T17:24:19Z
"Variation of the Fine-Structure Constant from the de Sitter Invariant
  Special Relativity","There are obvious discrepancies among various experimental constraints on the
variation of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$. We attempt to discuss the
issue in the framework of de Sitter invariant Special Relativity (${\cal
SR}_{c,R}$) and to present a possible solution to the disagreement. In
addition, on the basis of the observational data and the discussions presented
in this Letter, we derive a rough theoretical estimate of the radius of the
Universe.",2007-03-06T09:50:35Z
"Thermodynamics of Ideal Boson and Fermion Gases in the Static Taub
  Universe","Some thermodynamic quantities of nonrelativistic ideal boson and fermion
gases in the static Taub universe are derived to first order in a small
anisotropy parameter d which measuring the deformation from the spherical
Einstein universe. They are used to investigate the problem of how the
curvature anisotropy affects the thermodynamic behaviors of an ideal gas. It is
found that, when the universe is in the oblate configuration (i.e., d > 0), the
effect of curvature anisotropy is to increase the number of the fraction in the
Bose-Einstein condensation and to decrease the fermion distribution function at
low temperature. When the universe is in the prolate configuration (i.e., d <
0), the effects of curvature anisotropy on the thermodynamic quantities is
contrary to that in the oblate configuration. The density matrix of a two
particle system is evaluated and it is used to define the ""statistical
interparticle potential"" as an attempt to give a ""statistical interpretation""
about the found thermodynamic behaviors. It is found that when the universe is
in the oblate (prolate) configuration the curvature anisotropy will enhance
(reduce) both the ""statistic attraction"" among the bosons and ""statistical
repulsion"" among the fermions. It is expected that such a behavior will also be
shown in the relativistic system.",2007-01-27T10:07:31Z
"Microscopic annealing process and its impact on superconductivity in
  T'-structure electron-doped copper oxides","High-transition-temperature superconductivity arises in copper oxides when
holes or electrons are doped into the CuO2 planes of their insulating parent
compounds. While hole-doping quickly induces metallic behavior and
superconductivity in many cuprates, electron-doping alone is insufficient in
materials such as R2CuO4 (R is Nd, Pr, La, Ce, etc.), where it is necessary to
anneal an as-grown sample in a low-oxygen environment to remove a tiny amount
of oxygen in order to induce superconductivity. Here we show that the
microscopic process of oxygen reduction repairs Cu deficiencies in the as-grown
materials and creates oxygen vacancies in the stoichiometric CuO2 planes,
effectively reducing disorder and providing itinerant carriers for
superconductivity. The resolution of this long-standing materials issue
suggests that the fundamental mechanism for superconductivity is the same for
electron- and hole-doped copper oxides.",2007-01-15T18:34:37Z
"Confinement of fractional quantum Hall states in narrow conducting
  channels","Confinement of small-gapped fractional quantum Hall states facilitates
quasiparticle manipulation and is an important step towards quasiparticle
interference measurements. Demonstrated here is conduction through top gate
defined, narrow channels in high density, ultra-high mobility heterostructures.
Transport evidence for the persistence of a correlated state at filling
fraction 5/3 is shown in channels of 2micron length but gated to near 0.3micron
in width. The methods employed to achieve this confinement hold promise for
interference devices proposed for studying potential non-Abelian statistics at
filling fraction 5/2.",2007-03-08T04:23:37Z
"Optical reference geometry and inertial forces in Kerr-de Sitter
  spacetimes","Optical reference geometry and related concept of inertial forces are
investigated in Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes. Properties of the inertial forces
are summarized and their typical behaviour is illustrated. The intuitive
'Newtonian' application of the forces in the relativistic dynamics is
demonstrated in the case of the test particle circular motion, static
equilibrium positions and perfect fluid toroidal configurations. Features of
the optical geometry are illustrated by the embedding diagrams of its
equatorial plane. The embedding diagrams do not cover whole the stationary
regions of the spacetimes, therefore the limits of embeddability are
established. A shape of the embedding diagrams is related to the behaviour of
the centrifugal force and it is characterized by the number of turning points
of the diagrams. Discussion of the number of embeddable photon circular orbits
is also included and the typical embedding diagrams are constructed. The
Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes are classified according to the properties of the
inertial forces and embedding diagrams.",2007-01-03T16:58:58Z
"Effect of the metal-to-wire ratio on the high-frequency magnetoimpedance
  of glass-coated CoFeBSi amorphous microwires","High frequency [1-500 MHz] measurements of the magnetoimpedance (MI) of
glass-coated Co$_{69.4}$Fe$_{3.7}$B$_{15.9}$Si$_{11}$ microwires are carried
out with various metal-to-wire diameter ratios. A twin-peak, anhysteretic
behaviour is observed as a function of magnetic field. A maximum in the
normalized impedance, $\Delta Z$/$Z$, appears at different values of the
frequency $f$, 125, 140 and 85 MHz with the corresponding diameter ratio $p$ =
0.80, 0.55 and 0.32. We describe the measurement technique and interpret our
results with a thermodynamic model that leads to a clearer view of the effects
of $p$ on the maximum value of MI and the anisotropy field. The behavior of the
real and imaginary components of impedance is also investigated; they display a
resonance that becomes a function of the DC field $H_{DC}$ for values larger or
equal to $H_{K}$ the circumferential anisotropy field for each $p $ value.
These results are interpreted in terms of a rotation model of the outer shell
magnetization.",2007-01-04T16:19:50Z
"Increasing informativity of the Thermally Stimulated Depolarization
  method","Two modifications of the Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Current method
are proposed to improve resolution and sensitivity of the method by connecting
either a real capacitor, or an additional resistor in series with the sample.
It is shown experimentally that high sensitivity of the TSDC method with an air
gap can be obtained, if the gap is substituted by the capacitor, while all
advantages of the method remain in force. It has been found that in one
experiment it is possible not only to measure the TSD current, but also to
obtain data on the Thermally Stimulated Conductivity, if the properly selected
additional resistor is periodically switched on and off.",2007-03-08T18:01:26Z
"Temperature-extended Jarzynski relation: Application to the numerical
  calculation of the surface tension","We consider a generalization of the Jarzynski relation to the case where the
system interacts with a bath for which the temperature is not kept constant but
can vary during the transformation. We suggest to use this relation as a
replacement to the thermodynamic perturbation method or the Bennett method for
the estimation of the order-order surface tension by Monte Carlo simulations.
To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we present some numerical data
for the 3D Ising model.",2007-02-02T11:06:31Z
New features in the phase diagram of TbMnO$_3$,"The (H,T)-phase diagram of the multiferroic perovskite TbMnO$_3$ was studied
by high-resolution thermal expansion $\alpha(T)$ and magnetostriction $\Delta
L(H)/L$ measurements. Below $T_{N}\simeq 42$ K, TbMnO$_3$ shows
antiferromagnetic order, which changes at $T_{FE}\simeq 28$ K where
simultaneously a spontaneous polarization $P||c$ develops. Sufficiently high
magnetic fields applied along $a$ or $b$ induce a polarization flop to $P||a$.
We find that all of these transitions are strongly coupled to the lattice
parameters. Thus, our data allow for a precise determination of the phase
boundaries and also yield information about their uniaxial pressure
dependencies. The strongly hysteretic phase boundary to the ferroelectric phase
with $P||a$ is derived in detail. Contrary to previous reports, we find that
even in high magnetic fields there are no direct transitions from this phase to
the paraelectric phase. We also determine the various phase boundaries in the
low-temperature region related to complex reordering transitions of the Tb
moments.",2007-01-19T20:35:22Z
"EROs found behind lensing clusters. II. Stellar populations and dust
  properties of optical dropout EROs and comparison with related objects","We determine the nature, redshift, stellar populations and dust properties of
optically faint or non-detected extremely red objects (ERO) found from our
survey of the lensing clusters A1835 and AC114. We perform SED fitting and use
deep optical, HST, VLT, Spitzer data, and for some objects and sub-mm data. For
most of the lensed EROs we find photometric redshifts showing a strong
degeneracy between ""low-z"" (z~1-3) and high-z (z~6-7). Although formally best
fits are often found at high-z, their resulting bright absolute magnitudes, the
number density of these objects, and in some cases Spitzer photometry or longer
wavelength observations, suggest strongly that all of these objects are at
""low-z"". The majority of these objects are best fitted with young (<~ 0.5-0.7
Gyr) and dusty starbursts. Indications for strong extinction, with A_V~2.4-4,
are found in some objects. For dusty objects star formation rates (SFR) have
been estimated from the bolometric luminosity determined after fitting of
semi-empirical starburst, ERO, and ULIRG templates. Typically we find
SFR~(1-18) Msun/yr. Again, SMMJ14009+0252 stands out as a LIRG with SFR 1000
Msun/yr. Concerning the comparison objects, we argue that the massive
post-starburst z~6.5 galaxy candidate HUDF-J2 showing observed properties very
similar to our EROs, is more likely a dusty starburst at z~2.3-2.6. This
interpretation also naturally explains the observed 24 micron emission. Both
empirically and from our SED fits we find that the IRAC selectec EROs from Yan
et al (2004) show very similar properties to our lensed EROs. Reasonable fits
are found for most of them with relatively young and dusty stellar populations.",2007-03-15T10:46:34Z
An evolutionary catalogue of Galactic post-AGB and related objects,"With the ongoing AKARI infrared sky survey, of much greater sensitivity than
IRAS, a wealth of post-AGB objects may be discovered. It is thus time to
organize our present knowledge of known post-AGB stars in th galaxy with a view
to using it to search for new post-AGB objects among AKARI sources. We searched
the literature available on the NASA Astrophysics Data System up to 1 October
2006, and defined criteria for classifying sources into three categories: ""very
likely"", ""possible"" and ""disqualified"" post-AGB objects. The category of ""very
likely"" post-AGB objects is made up of several classes. We have created an
evolutionary, on-line catalogue of Galactic post-AGB objects, to be referred to
as ""The Torun catalogue of Galactic post-AGB and related objects"". The present
version of the catalogue contains 326 ""very likely"", 107 ""possible"" and 64
""disqualified"" objects. For the very likely post-AGB objects, the catalogue
gives the available optical and infrared photometry, infrared spectroscopy and
spectral types, and links to finding charts and bibliography.",2007-03-28T10:40:21Z
Photoconductivity of Single-crystalline Selenium Nanotubes,"Photoconductivity of single-crystalline selenium nanotubes (SCSNT) under a
range of illumination intensities of a 633nm laser is carried out with a novel
two terminal device arrangement at room temperature. It's found that SCSNT
forms Schottky barriers with the W and Au contacts, and the barrier height is a
function of the light intensities. In low illumination regime below 1.46x10E-4
muWmum-2, the Au-Se-W hybrid structure exhibits sharp switch on/off behavior,
and the turn-on voltages decrease with increasing illuminating intensities. In
the high illumination regime above 7x10E-4 muWmum-2, the device exhibits ohmic
conductance with a photoconductivity as high as 0.59Ohmcm-1, significantly
higher that reported values for carbon and GaN nanotubes. This finding suggests
that SCSNT is potentially a good photo-sensor material as well we a very
effective solar cell material.",2007-02-05T06:34:18Z
"Quantum dynamics of repulsively bound atom pairs in the Bose-Hubbard
  model","We investigate the quantum dynamics of repulsively bound atom pairs in an
optical lattice described by the periodic Bose-Hubbard model both analytically
and numerically. In the strongly repulsive limit, we analytically study the
dynamical problem by the perturbation method with the hopping terms treated as
a perturbation. For a finite-size system, we numerically solve the dynamic
problem in the whole regime of interaction by the exact diagonalization method.
Our results show that the initially prepared atom pairs are dynamically stable
and the dissociation of atom pairs is greatly suppressed when the strength of
the on-site interaction is much greater than the tunneling amplitude, i.e., the
strongly repulsive interaction induces a self-localization phenomenon of the
atom pairs.",2007-01-21T08:20:17Z
Semiclassical quantization of the Bogoliubov spectrum,"We analyze the Bogoliubov spectrum of the 3-sites Bose-Hubbard model with
finite number of Bose particles by using a semiclassical approach. The
Bogoliubov spectrum is shown to be associated with the low-energy regular
component of the classical Hubbard model. We identify the full set of the
integrals of motions of this regular component and, quantizing them, obtain the
energy levels of the quantum system. The critical values of the energy, above
which the regular Bogoliubov spectrum evolves into a chaotic spectrum, is
indicated as well.",2007-02-20T11:27:27Z
Molecular dynamics of ice-nanotube formation inside carbon nanotubes,"The first order phase transition of a water cluster confined in a dynamic
single-walled carbon nanotube is investigated using a classical molecular
dynamics (MD) method. The formation of ice-nanotube is monitored through the
structure factor and potential energies. The transition temperature and its
diameter dependence obtained by the simulations agree well with those of
previously reported experiments. The transition temperature of the ice-nanotube
was shown to take a maximum value of around room temperature with the number of
the ring members n=5. Potential energy contribution to the phase change is
generally dominated by that of the intrinsic water-water interaction, while
that of water-carbon interaction plays a significant role on determining the
dependence of transition temperature on the nanotube diameter.",2007-02-23T08:46:27Z
Projection operator formalism and entropy,"The entropy definition is deduced by means of (re)deriving the generalized
non-linear Langevin equation using Zwanzig projector operator formalism. It is
shown to be necessarily related to an invariant measure which, in classical
mechanics, can always be taken to be the Liouville measure. It is not true that
one is free to choose a ``relevant'' probability density independently as is
done in other flavors of projection operator formalism. This observation
induces an entropy expression which is valid also outside the thermodynamic
limit and in far from equilibrium situations. The Zwanzig projection operator
formalism therefore gives a deductive derivation of non-equilibrium, and
equilibrium, thermodynamics. The entropy definition found is closely related to
the (generalized) microcanonical Boltzmann-Planck definition but with some
subtle differences. No ``shell thickness'' arguments are needed, nor desirable,
for a rigorous definition. The entropy expression depends on the choice of
macroscopic variables and does not exactly transform as a scalar quantity. The
relation with expressions used in the GENERIC formalism are discussed.",2007-03-26T11:26:34Z
"Characterization of Rate Region in Interference Channels with
  Constrained Power","In this paper, an $n$-user Gaussian interference channel, where the power of
the transmitters are subject to some upper-bounds is studied. We obtain a
closed-form expression for the rate region of such a channel based on the
Perron-Frobenius theorem. While the boundary of the rate region for the case of
unconstrained power is a well-established result, this is the first result for
the case of constrained power. We extend this result to the time-varying
channels and obtain a closed-form solution for the rate region of such
channels.",2007-01-25T19:59:51Z
Image Ellipticity from Atmospheric Aberrations,"We investigate the ellipticity of the point-spread function (PSF) produced by
imaging an unresolved source with a telescope, subject to the effects of
atmospheric turbulence. It is important to quantify these effects in order to
understand the errors in shape measurements of astronomical objects, such as
those used to study weak gravitational lensing of field galaxies. The PSF
modeling involves either a Fourier transform of the phase information in the
pupil plane or a ray-tracing approach, which has the advantage of requiring
fewer computations than the Fourier transform. Using a standard method,
involving the Gaussian weighted second moments of intensity, we then calculate
the ellipticity of the PSF patterns. We find significant ellipticity for the
instantaneous patterns (up to more than 10%). Longer exposures, which we
approximate by combining multiple (N) images from uncorrelated atmospheric
realizations, yield progressively lower ellipticity (as 1 / sqrt(N)). We also
verify that the measured ellipticity does not depend on the sampling interval
in the pupil plane using the Fourier method. However, we find that the results
using the ray-tracing technique do depend on the pupil sampling interval,
representing a gradual breakdown of the geometric approximation at high spatial
frequencies. Therefore, ray tracing is generally not an accurate method of
modeling PSF ellipticity induced by atmospheric turbulence unless some
additional procedure is implemented to correctly account for the effects of
high spatial frequency aberrations. The Fourier method, however, can be used
directly to accurately model PSF ellipticity, which can give insights into
errors in the statistics of field galaxy shapes used in studies of weak
gravitational lensing.",2007-03-06T05:25:39Z
"On Approximating Optimal Weighted Lobbying, and Frequency of Correctness
  versus Average-Case Polynomial Time","We investigate issues related to two hard problems related to voting, the
optimal weighted lobbying problem and the winner problem for Dodgson elections.
Regarding the former, Christian et al. [CFRS06] showed that optimal lobbying is
intractable in the sense of parameterized complexity. We provide an efficient
greedy algorithm that achieves a logarithmic approximation ratio for this
problem and even for a more general variant--optimal weighted lobbying. We
prove that essentially no better approximation ratio than ours can be proven
for this greedy algorithm.
  The problem of determining Dodgson winners is known to be complete for
parallel access to NP [HHR97]. Homan and Hemaspaandra [HH06] proposed an
efficient greedy heuristic for finding Dodgson winners with a guaranteed
frequency of success, and their heuristic is a ``frequently self-knowingly
correct algorithm.'' We prove that every distributional problem solvable in
polynomial time on the average with respect to the uniform distribution has a
frequently self-knowingly correct polynomial-time algorithm. Furthermore, we
study some features of probability weight of correctness with respect to
Procaccia and Rosenschein's junta distributions [PR07].",2007-03-20T20:35:02Z
Andreev reflection in bilayer graphene,"We consider the conductance of a normal-superconductor junction in bilayer
graphene in the framework of the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De-Gennes equation. A
remarkable suppression of the conductance at voltages just below the
superconducting gap is found. This can be understood in terms of the spinor
structures of the electron and hole excitations, in particular the reflected
valence band hole being orthogonal to the incoming electron at normal
incidence.

"Superconductivity, Charge Orderings and Phase Separations in Systems
  with Local Electron Pairing","We study two effective models developed for description of superconductors
with short-coherence length: (i) the extended Hubbard model with on-site
attraction and intersite repulsion, (ii) the model of hard-core charged bosons
on a lattice. The analysis is concentrated on the problem of phase separations
and competition between superconductivity (SS) and charge-density-wave (CDW)
orderings. The phase diagrams of the systems are shown to consist of at least
seven different states, including 3 types of phase separated (PS) states:
CDW-SS (PS1), CDW-normal (PS2) and the state of electron droplets (PS3). By
taking into account the PS states and the effects of longer-range
density-density interactions (beyond nearest neighbours) our work substantially
generalizes and modifies the conclusions of previous works concerning the
models considered.",2007-02-27T11:33:25Z
"High-pressure structural, elastic and electronic properties of the
  scintillator host material, KMgF_3","The high-pressure structural behaviour of the fluoroperovskite KMgF_3 is
investigated by theory and experiment. Density functional calculations were
performed within the local density approximation and the generalized gradient
approximation for exchange and correlation effects, as implemented within the
full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method. In situ high-pressure powder
x-ray diffraction experiments were performed up to a maximum pressure of 40 GPa
using synchrotron radiation. We find that the cubic Pm\bar{3}m crystal symmetry
persists throughout the pressure range studied. The calculated ground state
properties -- the equilibrium lattice constant, bulk modulus and elastic
constants -- are in good agreement with experimental results. By analyzing the
ratio between the bulk and shear modulii, we conclude that KMgF_3 is brittle in
nature. Under ambient conditions, KMgF_3 is found to be an indirect gap
insulator with the gap increasing under pressure.",2007-03-23T14:57:18Z
"Interaction-Induced Adiabatic Cooling for Antiferromagnetism in Optical
  Lattices","In the experimental context of cold-fermion optical lattices, we discuss the
possibilities to approach the pseudogap or ordered phases by manipulating the
scattering length or the strength of the laser-induced lattice potential. Using
the Two-Particle Self-Consistent Approach as well as Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, we provide isentropic curves for the two- and three-dimensional
Hubbard models at half-filling. These quantitative results are important for
practical attempts to reach the ordered antiferromagnetic phase in experiments
on optical lattices of two-component fermions. We find that adiabatically
turning on the interaction in two dimensions to cool the system is not very
effective. In three dimensions, adiabatic cooling to the antiferromagnetic
phase can be achieved in such a manner although the cooling efficiency is not
as high as initially suggested by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. Adiabatic
cooling by turning off the repulsion beginning at strong coupling is possible
in certain cases.",2007-03-13T20:04:23Z
"Universal features of information spreading efficiency on
  $d$-dimensional lattices","A model for information spreading in a population of $N$ mobile agents is
extended to $d$-dimensional regular lattices. This model, already studied on
two-dimensional lattices, also takes into account the degeneration of
information as it passes from one agent to the other. Here, we find that the
structure of the underlying lattice strongly affects the time $\tau$ at which
the whole population has been reached by information. By comparing numerical
simulations with mean-field calculations, we show that dimension $d=2$ is
marginal for this problem and mean-field calculations become exact for $d > 2$.
Nevertheless, the striking nonmonotonic behavior exhibited by the final degree
of information with respect to $N$ and the lattice size $L$ appears to be
geometry independent.",2007-02-26T11:06:24Z
"Tetragonal and trigonal deformations in zinc-blende semiconductors : a
  tight-binding point of view","The deformation potentials of cubic semiconductors are re-examined from the
point of view of the extended-basis $sp^3d^5s^*$ tight-binding model. Previous
parametrizations had failed to account properly for trigonal deformations, even
leading to incorrect sign of the acoustic component of the shear deformation
potential {\it d}. The strain-induced shifts and splittings of the on-site
energies of the p- and d-orbitals are shown to play a prominent role in
obtaining satisfactory values of deformation potentials both at the zone center
and zone extrema. The present approach results in excellent agreement with
available experimental data and ab-initio calculations.",2007-03-01T17:08:23Z
"Determination of Black Hole Mass in Cyg X-1 by Scaling of Spectral
  Index-QPO Frequency Correlation","It is well established that timing and spectral properties of Galactic Black
Hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRB) are strongly correlated. In particular, it has
been shown that low frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) frequency -
photon index correlation curves have a specific pattern. In a number of sources
the shape of the index-low frequency QPO correlations are self-similar with a
position offset in the QPO frequency-Gamma plane. Titarchuk & Fiorito presented
strong theoretical and observational arguments that the QPO frequency values in
this QPO frequency-Gamma correlation should be inversely proportional to
M_{BH}. A simple translation of the correlation for a given source along the
frequency axis leads to the observed correlation for another source. As a
result of this translation one can obtain a scaling factor which is simply a BH
mass ratio for these particular sources. This property of the correlations
offers a fundamentally new method for BH mass determination in XRBs. Here we
use the observed QPO-index correlations observed in three BH sources: GRO
J1655-40, GRS 1915+105 and Cyg X-1. The BH mass of (6.3 +/- 0.5) M_Sun in GRO
J1655-40 is obtained using optical observations. RXTE observations during the
recent 2005 outburst yielded sufficient data to establish the correlation
pattern during both rise and decay of the event. We use GRO J1655-40 as a
standard reference source to measure the BH mass in Cyg X-1. We also revisit
the GRS 1915+105 data as a further test of our scaling method. We infer the
value of BH mass of (15.6 +/- 1.5) M_Sun in this source which is consistent
with the previous BH mass estimate in GRS 1915 of (13.3 +/- 4) M_Sun. We obtain
the BH mass in Cyg X-1 in the range (8.7 +/- 0.8) M_Sun.",2007-03-16T14:55:27Z
Driving particle current through narrow channels using classical pump,"We study a symmetric exclusion process in which the hopping rates at two
chosen adjacent sites vary periodically in time and have a relative phase
difference. This mimics a colloidal suspension subjected to external space and
time dependent modulation of the diffusion constant. The two special sites act
as a classical pump by generating an oscillatory current with a nonzero ${\cal
DC}$ value whose direction depends on the applied phase difference. We analyze
various features in this model through simulations and obtain an expression for
the $\cal{DC}$ current via a novel perturbative treatment.",2007-03-13T12:21:04Z
"Exact results of the mixed-spin Ising model on a decorated square
  lattice with two different decorating spins of integer magnitudes","The mixed-spin Ising model on a decorated square lattice with two different
decorating spins of the integer magnitudes S_B = 1 and S_C = 2 placed on
horizontal and vertical bonds of the lattice, respectively, is examined within
an exact analytical approach based on the generalized decoration-iteration
mapping transformation. Besides the ground-state analysis, finite-temperature
properties of the system are also investigated in detail. The most interesting
numerical result to emerge from our study relates to a striking critical
behaviour of the spontaneously ordered 'quasi-1D' spin system. It was found
that this quite remarkable spontaneous order arises when one sub-lattice of the
decorating spins (either S_B or S_C) tends towards their 'non-magnetic' spin
state S = 0 and the system becomes disordered only upon further single-ion
anisotropy strengthening. The effect of single-ion anisotropy upon the
temperature dependence of the total and sub-lattice magnetization is also
particularly investigated.",2007-03-26T08:28:06Z
"Dynamical Heterogeneity and the interplay between activated and mode
  coupling dynamics in supercooled liquids","We present a theoretical analysis of the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of a
liquid at and below the mode coupling critical temperature $T_c$, by developing
a self-consistent theoretical treatment which includes the contributions both
from continuous diffusion, described using general two coupling parameter
($F_{12}$) mode coupling theory (MCT), and from the activated hopping,
described using the random first order transition (RFOT) theory, incorporating
the effect of dynamical heterogeneity. The theory is valid over the whole
temperature plane and shows correct limiting MCT like behavior above $T_{c}$
and goes over to the RFOT theory near the glass transition temperature,
$T_{g}$. Between $T_{c}$ and $T_{g}$, the theory predicts that neither the
continuous diffusion, described by pure mode coupling theory, nor the hopping
motion alone suffices but both contribute to the dynamics while interacting
with each other. We show that the interplay between the two contributions
conspires to modify the relaxation behavior of the DSF from what would be
predicted by a theory with a complete static Gaussian barrier distribution in a
manner that may be described as a facilitation effect. Close to $T_c$, coupling
between the short time part of MCT dynamics and hopping reduces the stretching
given by the F$_{12}$-MCT theory significantly and accelerates structural
relaxation. As the temperature is progressively lowered below $T_c$, the
equations yield a crossover from MCT dominated regime to the hopping dominated
regime. In the combined theory the dynamical heterogeneity is modified because
the low barrier components interact with the MCT dynamics to enhance the
relaxation rate below $T_c$ and reduces the stretching that would otherwise
arise from an input static barrier height distribution.",2007-02-19T12:45:51Z
Evolution in the iron abundance of the ICM,"We present a Chandra analysis of the X-ray spectra of 56 clusters of galaxies
at $z>0.3$, which cover a temperature range of $3> kT > 15$ keV. Our analysis
is aimed at measuring the iron abundance in the ICM out to the highest redshift
probed to date. We find that the emission-weighted iron abundance measured
within $(0.15-0.3) R_{vir}$ in clusters below 5 keV is, on average, a factor of
$\sim2$ higher than in hotter clusters, following $Z(T)\simeq 0.88 T^{-0.47}
Z_\odot$, which confirms the trend seen in local samples. We made use of
combined spectral analysis performed over five redshift bins at $0.3> z > 1.3$
to estimate the average emission weighted iron abundance. We find a constant
average iron abundance $Z_{Fe}\simeq 0.25 Z_\odot$ as a function of redshift,
but only for clusters at $z>0.5$. The emission-weighted iron abundance is
significantly higher ($Z_{Fe}\simeq0.4 Z_\odot$) in the redshift range
$z\simeq0.3-0.5$, approaching the value measured locally in the inner $0.15
R_{vir}$ radii for a mix of cool-core and non cool-core clusters in the
redshift range $0.1<z<0.3$. The decrease in $Z_{Fe}$ with $z$ can be
parametrized by a power law of the form $\sim(1+z)^{-1.25}$. The observed
evolution implies that the average iron content of the ICM at the present epoch
is a factor of $\sim2$ larger than at $z\simeq 1.2$. We confirm that the ICM is
already significantly enriched ($Z_{Fe}\simeq0.25 Z_\odot$) at a look-back time
of 9 Gyr. Our data provide significant constraints on the time scales and
physical processes that drive the chemical enrichment of the ICM.",2007-03-12T13:26:19Z
"Self-consistent Coronal Heating and Solar Wind Acceleration from
  Anisotropic Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence","We present a series of models for the plasma properties along open magnetic
flux tubes rooted in solar coronal holes, streamers, and active regions. These
models represent the first self-consistent solutions that combine: (1)
chromospheric heating driven by an empirically guided acoustic wave spectrum,
(2) coronal heating from Alfven waves that have been partially reflected, then
damped by anisotropic turbulent cascade, and (3) solar wind acceleration from
gradients of gas pressure, acoustic wave pressure, and Alfven wave pressure.
The only input parameters are the photospheric lower boundary conditions for
the waves and the radial dependence of the background magnetic field along the
flux tube. For a single choice for the photospheric wave properties, our models
produce a realistic range of slow and fast solar wind conditions by varying
only the coronal magnetic field. Specifically, a 2D model of coronal holes and
streamers at solar minimum reproduces the latitudinal bifurcation of slow and
fast streams seen by Ulysses. The radial gradient of the Alfven speed affects
where the waves are reflected and damped, and thus whether energy is deposited
below or above the Parker critical point. As predicted by earlier studies, a
larger coronal ``expansion factor'' gives rise to a slower and denser wind,
higher temperature at the coronal base, less intense Alfven waves at 1 AU, and
correlative trends for commonly measured ratios of ion charge states and
FIP-sensitive abundances that are in general agreement with observations. These
models offer supporting evidence for the idea that coronal heating and solar
wind acceleration (in open magnetic flux tubes) can occur as a result of wave
dissipation and turbulent cascade. (abridged abstract)",2007-03-13T19:39:14Z
Geometrical Frustration in Liquid Fe and Fe-Based Metallic Glass,"We investigate short rane order in liquid and supercooled liquid Fe and
Fe-based metallic glass using ab-initio simulation methods. We analyze the data
to quantify the degree of local icosahedral and polytetrahedral order and to
understand the role of alloying in controlling the degree of geometric
frustration . Comparing elemental Fe to Cu we find that the degree of
icosahedral order is greater in Fe than in Cu, possibly because icosahedral
disclination line defects are more easily incorporated into BCC environments
than FCC. In Fe-based metallic glass-forming alloys (FeB and FeZrB) we find
that introducing small concentrations of small B atoms and large Zr atoms
controls the frustration of local icosahedral order.",2007-02-10T18:04:06Z
"Stochastic Models of Evolution in Genetics, Ecology and Linguistics","We give a overview of stochastic models of evolution that have found
applications in genetics, ecology and linguistics for an audience of
nonspecialists, especially statistical physicists. In particular, we focus
mostly on neutral models in which no intrinsic advantage is ascribed to a
particular type of the variable unit, for example a gene, appearing in the
theory. In many cases these models are exactly solvable and furthermore go some
way to describing observed features of genetic, ecological and linguistic
systems.",2007-03-19T09:17:18Z
Far-infrared dust properties in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds,"A recent data analysis of the far-infrared (FIR) map of the Galaxy and the
Magellanic Clouds has shown that there is a tight correlation between two FIR
colours: the 60 um-100 um and 100 um-140 um colours. This FIR colour relation
called ``main correlation'' can be interpreted as indicative of a sequence of
various interstellar radiation fields with a common FIR optical property of
grains. In this paper, we constrain the FIR optical properties of grains by
comparing the calculated FIR colours with the observational main correlation.
We show that neither of the ``standard'' grain species (i.e. astronomical
silicate and graphite grains) reproduces the main correlation. However, if the
emissivity index at ~ 100--200 um is changed to ~ 1--1.5 (not ~ 2 as the above
two species), the main correlation can be successfully explained. Thus, we
propose that the FIR emissivity index is ~ 1--1.5 for the dust in the Galaxy
and the Magellanic Clouds at ~ 100--200 um. We also consider the origin of the
minor correlation called ``sub-correlation'', which can be used to estimate the
Galactic star formation rate.",2007-03-20T07:49:38Z
Diffusion and activation of n-type dopants in germanium,"The diffusion and activation of $n$-type impurities (P and As) implanted into
$p$-type Ge(100) substrates were examined under various dose and annealing
conditions. The secondary ion mass spectrometry profiles of chemical
concentrations indicated the existence of a sufficiently high number of
impurities with increasing implanted doses. However, spreading resistance probe
profiles of electrical concentrations showed electrical concentration
saturation in spite of increasing doses and indicated poor activation of As
relative to P in Ge. The relationships between the chemical and electrical
concentrations of P in Ge and Si were calculated, taking into account the
effect of incomplete ionization. The results indicated that the activation of P
was almost the same in Ge and Si. The activation ratios obtained experimentally
were similar to the calculated values, implying insufficient degeneration of
Ge. The profiles of P in Ge substrates with and without damage generated by Ge
ion implantation were compared, and it was clarified that the damage that may
compensate the activated $n$-type dopants has no relationship with the
activation of P in Ge.",2007-03-27T14:24:19Z
"Large Magnetoresistance in Co/Ni/Co Ferromagnetic Single Electron
  Transistors","We report on magnetotransport investigations of nano-scaled ferromagnetic
Co/Ni/Co single electron transistors. As a result of reduced size, the devices
exhibit single electron transistor characteristics at 4.2K. Magnetotransport
measurements carried out at 1.8K reveal tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR)
traces with negative coercive fields, which we interpret in terms of a
switching mechanism driven by the shape anisotropy of the central wire-like Ni
island. A large TMR of about 18% is observed within a finite source-drain bias
regime. The TMR decreases rapidly with increasing bias, which we tentatively
attribute to excitation of magnons in the central island.",2007-02-15T17:07:10Z
Graphene as an electronic membrane,"Experiments are finally revealing intricate facts about graphene which go
beyond the ideal picture of relativistic Dirac fermions in pristine two
dimensional (2D) space, two years after its first isolation. While observations
of rippling added another dimension to the richness of the physics of graphene,
scanning single electron transistor images displayed prevalent charge
inhomogeneity. The importance of understanding these non-ideal aspects cannot
be overstated both from the fundamental research interest since graphene is a
unique arena for their interplay, and from the device applications interest
since the quality control is a key to applications. We investigate the membrane
aspect of graphene and its impact on the electronic properties. We show that
curvature generates spatially varying electrochemical potential. Further we
show that the charge inhomogeneity in turn stabilizes ripple formation.",2007-02-23T22:45:30Z
"Pairing Gaps, Pseudogaps, and Phase Diagrams for Cuprate Superconductors","We use a symmetry-constrained variational procedure to construct a
generalization of BCS to include Cooper pairs with non-zero momentum and
angular momentum. The resulting gap equations are solved at zero and finite
temperature, and the doping-dependent solutions are used to construct gap and
phase diagrams. We find a pseudogap terminating at a critical doping that may
be interpreted in terms of both competing order and preformed pairs. The strong
similarity between observation and predicted gap and phase structure suggests
that this approach may provide a unified description of the complex structure
observed for cuprate superconductors.",2007-02-21T16:16:35Z
"Escape of photons from two fixed extreme Reissner-Nordström black
  holes","We study the scattering of light (null geodesics) by two fixed extreme
Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes, in which the gravitational attraction of
their masses is exactly balanced with the electrostatic repulsion of their
charges, allowing a static spacetime. We identify the set of unstable periodic
orbits that constitute the fractal repeller that completely describes the
chaotic escape dynamics of photons. In the framework of periodic orbit theory,
the analysis of the linear stability of the unstable periodic orbits is used to
obtain the main quantities of chaos that characterize the escape dynamics of
the photons scattered by the black holes. In particular, the escape rate which
is compared with the result obtained from numerical simulations that consider
statistical ensembles of photons. We also analyze the dynamics of photons in
the proximity of a perturbed black hole and give an analytical estimation for
the escape rate in this system.",2007-01-09T15:57:37Z
"On the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation of quasiparticles: on the
  possibility of condensation of magnons at high temperatures","Bose condensation of quasiparticles in physical systems of finite size iz
considered for the case of ferromagnetic thin films. It is shown that in
accordance with present-day experimental capabilities which permit one to
achieve densities of long-wave spin excitation of 1018-1019 cm-3, in such films
the formation of condensate of such quasiparticles begins at temperatures T~100
K (room one including). It is found that Bose condensation is accompanied by
scaling phenomenon according to which the main thermodynamic variable is not
the number N of particles but the ratio N/T. This indicates that condensation
of magnons can be observed at relatively low magnon densities. The roles played
by the shape of the spectrum and film thickness are analyzed.",2007-01-18T09:28:13Z
Unified model for network dynamics exhibiting nonextensive statistics,"We introduce a dynamical network model which unifies a number of network
families which are individually known to exhibit $q$-exponential degree
distributions. The present model dynamics incorporates static (non-growing)
self-organizing networks, preferentially growing networks, and (preferentially)
rewiring networks. Further, it exhibits a natural random graph limit. The
proposed model generalizes network dynamics to rewiring and growth modes which
depend on internal topology as well as on a metric imposed by the space they
are embedded in. In all of the networks emerging from the presented model we
find q-exponential degree distributions over a large parameter space. We
comment on the parameter dependence of the corresponding entropic index q for
the degree distributions, and on the behavior of the clustering coefficients
and neighboring connectivity distributions.",2007-01-02T14:09:49Z
Transport of interface states in the Heisenberg chain,"We demonstrate the transport of interface states in the one-dimensional
ferromagnetic Heisenberg model by a time dependent magnetic field. Our analysis

calculate the adiabatic constant as a function of the strength of the magnetic
field and the anisotropy of the interaction.",2007-02-02T23:16:00Z
"Oxygen isotope effect on the superconductivity and stripe phase in
  La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$","The oxygen isotope effect on the superconductivity, stripe phase and
structure transition is systematically investigated in
La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ with static stripe phase. Substitution of
$^{16}$O by $^{18}$O leads to a decrease in superconducting transition
temperature T$_C$, while enhances the temperature of the structural transition
from low-temperature-orthorhombic (LTO) phase to low-temperature-tetragonal
(LTT) phase. Compared to the Nd free sample, a larger isotope effect on $T_C$
is observed in La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$. These results indicate
that the distortion of CuO$_2$ plane suppresses the superconductivity, giving a
direct evidence for the competing of stripe phase and superconductivity because
the distortion of CuO$_2$ plane enhances the stripe phase.",2007-03-25T13:41:28Z
Polygraphs for termination of left-linear term rewriting systems,"We present a methodology for proving termination of left-linear term
rewriting systems (TRSs) by using Albert Burroni's polygraphs, a kind of
rewriting systems on algebraic circuits. We translate the considered TRS into a
polygraph of minimal size whose termination is proven with a polygraphic
interpretation, then we get back the property on the TRS. We recall Yves
Lafont's general translation of TRSs into polygraphs and known links between
their termination properties. We give several conditions on the original TRS,
including being a first-order functional program, that ensure that we can
reduce the size of the polygraphic translation. We also prove sufficient
conditions on the polygraphic interpretations of a minimal translation to imply
termination of the original TRS. Examples are given to compare this method with
usual polynomial interpretations.",2007-02-07T10:18:09Z
Sr_2 Ru O_4 : Broken Time-Reversal Symmetry in the Superconducting state,"Using a phenomenological two-fluid model we derive the Kerr rotation of the
polarization direction of reflected light from the surface of a superconductor
in a state breaking time-reversal symmetry. We argue that this effect found
recently in the superconducting state of $Sr_2RuO_4$ by Xia et al
(Phys.Rev.Lett. {\bf 97}, 167002 (2006)) originates from the spontaneous
magnetization in this superconductor. The temperature and the frequency
dependencies of the effect are established. It is shown that the effect is
determined by one of two mechanisms depending on the frequency of light that is
larger or smaller than the plasma frequency. The mechanism originating from the
gradient of chemical potential created by the electric field of light
penetrating into the skin layer and important at frequencies larger than the
plasma frequency was missed in the preliminary version of this paper
(V.P.Mineev, arXiv:cond-mat/0703624v2).",2007-03-23T15:34:42Z
"Anisotropic Electron Spin Lifetime in (In,Ga)As/GaAs (110) Quantum Wells","Anisotropic electron spin lifetimes in strained undoped (In,Ga)As/GaAs (110)
quantum wells of different width and height are investigated by time-resolved
Faraday rotation and time-resolved transmission and are compared to the
(001)-orientation. From the suppression of spin precession, the ratio of
in-plane to out-of-plane spin lifetimes is calculated. Whereas the ratio

Instabilities in the vortex matter and the peak effect phenomenon,"In single crystals of 2H-NbSe2, we identify for the first time a crossover
from weak collective to strong pinning regime in the vortex state which is not
associated with the peak effect phenomenon. Instead, we find the crossover is
associated with anomalous history dependent magnetization response. In the
field (Bdc) - temperature (T) vortex matter phase diagram we demarcate this
pinning crossover boundary. We also delineate another boundary which separates
the strong pinning region from a thermal fluctuation dominated regime, and find
that PE appears on this boundary.",2007-01-05T13:25:16Z
"Resolution in Focused Electron- and Ion-Beam Induced Chemical Vapor
  Deposition","The key physical processes governing resolution of focused electron-beam and

model. We quantify for the first time how the balance of molecule depletion and
replenishment determines the resolution inside the locally irradiated area.
Scaling laws are derived relating the resolution of the deposits to molecule

Quantum confinement effects in InAs-InP core-shell nanowires,"We report the detection of quantum confinement in single InAs-InP core-shell
nanowires. The wires having an InAs core with ~25 nm diameter are characterized
by emission spectra in which two peaks are identified under high excitation
intensity conditions. The peaks are caused by emission from the ground and
excited quantized levels, due to the quantum confinement in the plane
perpendicular to the nanowire axis. We have identified in the emission spectra
different energy contributions related to the wurtzite structure of the wires,
the strain between the wurtzite core and shell, and the confinement energy of
the InAs core. Calculations based on 6-band strain-dependent k.p theory allow
the theoretical estimation of the confined energy states in such materials and
we found these results to be in good agreement with those from the
photoluminescence studies.",2007-01-04T17:57:24Z
From density-matrix renormalization group to matrix product states,"In this paper we give an introduction to the numerical density matrix

general matrix product state (MPS) formulation. We cover in detail the
differences between the original DMRG formulation and the MPS approach,
demonstrating the additional flexibility that arises from constructing both the
wavefunction and the Hamiltonian in MPS form. We also show how to make use of
global symmetries, for both the Abelian and non-Abelian cases.",2007-01-18T14:02:08Z
Are magnetic hot stars intrinsic X-ray sources ?,"Context: X-ray surveys carried out with the Einstein and ROSAT satellites
have resulted in rather unexpected detections of X-ray emission from late
B-type and early A-type stars. These stars possess neither winds like
early-type stars nor convective envelopes as late-type stars, so that the
origin and production mechanism of this X-emission is unclear. Aims: We
investigate whether the presence of large magnetic fields is related to the
observed X-ray emission. Methods: We carried out Chandra high-angular
resolution observations of a sample of late B-type and A-type stars with
measured magnetic fields in the range from 0.2 - 17 kG. Out of the selected 10
sample stars, 6 objects had been previously detected as X-ray sources, some of
them, however, with high positional uncertainty and a low signal-to-noise
ratio, while 4 of our sample stars do have large magnetic fields but no
previous detections of X-ray emission. Results: Our Chandra data confirm all
previous ROSAT detections with an extremely high significance, and the limits
of the offsets between X-ray and optical positions are greatly improved. In
particular, HD 215441, known as Babcock's star with the strongest magnetic
field by far (17 kG) of our sample stars, a rather faint and somewhat marginal
ROSAT source, can clearly be detected. However, none of the 4 ROSAT
non-detections could be detected with the new Chandra observations.
Conclusions: The pure existence of a magnetic field of kiloGauss strength on a
late B-type or A-type star is therefore not necessarily a prerequisite for
finding X-ray emission among these stars. Understanding the observed X-ray
emission from Babcock's star is a challenge for observational and theoretical
astrophysics.",2007-03-20T11:23:52Z
"Charge transport in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid: effects of pumping and
  bias","We study the current produced in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by an applied
bias and by weak, point-like impurity potentials which are oscillating in time.
We use bosonization to perturbatively calculate the current up to second order
in the impurity potentials. In the regime of small bias and low pumping
frequency, both the DC and AC components of the current have power law
dependences on the bias and pumping frequencies with an exponent 2K - 1 for
spinless electrons, where K is the interaction parameter. For K < 1/2, the
current becomes large for special values of the bias. For non-interacting
electrons with K = 1, our results agree with those obtained using Floquet
scattering theory for Dirac fermions. We also discuss the cases of extended
impurities and of spin-1/2 electrons.",2007-02-19T08:38:55Z
"Thermodynamic Properties of the Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on a
  Railroad-Trestle Lattice with Asymmetric Leg Interactions","Using an approximation method for eigenvalue distribution functions, we study
the temperature dependence of specific heat of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
model on the asymmetric railroad-trestle lattice. This model contains both the
sawtooth-lattice and Majumdar-Ghosh models as special cases. Making
extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit using finite size data up to 28
spins, it is found that specific heat of the Majumdar-Ghosh model has a
two-peak structure in its temperature dependence and those of systems near the
sawtooth-lattice point have a three-peak structure.",2007-03-10T07:26:45Z
Thermodynamics of a Bose-Einstein Condensate with Weak Disorder,"We consider the thermodynamics of a homogeneous superfluid dilute Bose gas in
the presence of weak quenched disorder. Following the zero-temperature approach
of Huang and Meng, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian of a dilute Bose gas in an
external random delta-correlated potential by means of a Bogoliubov
transformation. We extend this approach to finite temperature by combining the
Popov and the many-body T-matrix approximations. This approach permits us to
include the quasi-particle interactions within this temperature range. We
derive the disorder-induced shifts of the Bose-Einstein critical temperature
and of the temperature for the onset of superfluidity by approaching the
transition points from below, i.e., from the superfluid phase. Our results lead
to a phase diagram consistent with that of the finite-temperature theory of
Lopatin and Vinokur which was based on the replica method, and in which the
transition points were approached from above.",2007-02-05T23:54:09Z

  equations by T.D. Frank","The purpose of this comment is to correct mistaken assumptions and claims
made in the paper Stochastic feedback, nonlinear families of Markov processes,
and nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations by T. D. Frank. Our comment centers on
the claims of a nonlinear Markov process and a nonlinear Fokker-Planck
equation. First, memory in transition densities is misidentified as a Markov
process. Second, Frank assumes that one can derive a Fokker-Planck equation
from a Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, but no proof was given that a
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation exists for memory-dependent processes. A nonlinear
Markov process is claimed on the basis of a nonlinear diffusion pde for a
1-point probability density. We show that, regardless of which initial value
problem one may solve for the 1-point density, the resulting stochastic
process, defined necessarily by the transition probabilities, is either an
ordinary linearly generated Markovian one, or else is a linearly generated
nonMarkovian process with memory. We provide explicit examples of diffusion
coefficients that reflect both the Markovian and the memory-dependent cases. So
there is neither a nonlinear Markov process nor nonlinear Fokker-Planck
equation for a transition density. The confusion rampant in the literature
arises in part from labeling a nonlinear diffusion equation for a 1-point
probability density as nonlinear Fokker-Planck, whereas neither a 1-point
density nor an equation of motion for a 1-point density defines a stochastic
process, and Borland misidentified a translation invariant 1-point density
derived from a nonlinear diffusion equation as a conditional probability
density. In the Appendix we derive Fokker-Planck pdes and Chapman-Kolmogorov
eqns. for stochastic processes with finite memory.",2007-01-24T11:11:32Z
"Quantum phases in a doped Mott insulator on the Shastry-Sutherland
  lattice","We propose the projected BCS wave function as the ground state for the doped
Mott insulator SrCu2(BO3)2 on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. At half filling
this wave function yields the exact ground state. Adding mobile charge
carriers, we find a strong asymmetry between electron and hole doping. Upon
electron doping an unusual metal with strong valence bond correlations forms.
Hole doped systems are d-wave RVB superconductors in which superconductivity is
strongly enhanced by the emergence of inhomogeneous plaquette bond order.",2007-02-05T21:42:24Z
"Regular second order perturbations of extreme mass ratio black hole
  binaries","We report on the first results of self-consistent second order metric
perturbations produced by a point particle moving in the Schwarzschild
spacetime. The second order waveforms satisfy a wave equation with an effective
source term build up from products of first order metric perturbations and its
derivatives. We have explicitly regularized this source term at the particle
location as well as at the horizon and at spatial infinity.",2007-01-05T20:49:25Z
RPAE versus RPA for the Tomonaga model with quadratic energy dispersion,"Recently the damping of the collective charge (and spin) modes of interacting
fermions in one spatial dimension was studied. It results from the nonlinear
correction to the energy dispersion in the vicinity of the Fermi points. To
investigate the damping one has to replace the random phase approximation (RPA)
bare bubble by a sum of more complicated diagrams. It is shown here that a
better starting point than the bare RPA is to use the (conserving) linearized
time dependent Hartree-Fock equations, i.e. to perform a random phase
approximation (with) exchange
  (RPAE) calculation. It is shown that the RPAE equation can be solved
analytically for the special form of the two-body interaction often used in the
Luttinger liquid framework. While (bare) RPA and RPAE agree for the case of a
strictly linear disperson there are qualitative differences for the case of the
usual nonrelativistic quadratic dispersion.",2007-02-21T10:34:57Z
"Domain structure sequence in ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 thin film on
  MgO","The structural evolution of a polydomain ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 film
was studied by temperature dependent X-ray diffraction. Two critical
temperatures were evidenced: T*=740K, corresponding to a change in the domain
structure (a/c/a/c to a1/a2/a1/a2), and Tc_film = 825K where the film undergoes
a ferroelectricparaelectric phase transition. The films remains tetragonal on
the whole range of temperature investigated. The evolutions of the domain
structure and lattice parameters were found to be in very good agreement with
the calculated domain stability map and theoretical temperature-misfit strain
phase diagram respectively.",2007-03-23T13:09:50Z
Nonlinear Energy Response of Glass Forming Materials,"A theory for the nonlinear energy response of a system subjected to a heat
bath is developed when the temperature of the heat bath is modulated
sinusoidally. The theory is applied to a model glass forming system, where the
landscape is assumed to have 20 basins and transition rates between basins obey
a power law distribution. It is shown that the statistics of eigenvalues of the
transition rate matrix, the glass transition temperature $T_g$, the
Vogel-Fulcher temperature $T_0$ and the crossover temperature $T_x$ can be
determined from the 1st- and 2nd-order ac specific heats, which are defined as
coefficients of the 1st- and 2nd-order energy responses. The imaginary part of
the 1st-order ac specific heat has a broad peak corresponding to the
distribution of the eigenvalues. When the temperature is decreased below $T_g$,
the frequency of the peak decreases and the width increases. Furthermore, the
statistics of eigenvalues can be obtained from the frequency dependence of the
1st-order ac specific heat. The 2nd-order ac specific heat shows extrema as a
function of the frequency. The extrema diverge at the Vogel-Fulcher temperature
$T_0$. The temperature dependence of the extrema changes significantly near
$T_g$ and some extrema vanish near $T_x$.",2007-01-27T16:51:52Z
"Dissipation peak as an indicator of sample inhomogeneity in solid $^4$He
  oscillator experiments","A simple phenomenological model is developed for the recent torsional
oscillator experiments on solid $^4$He. Within this model, for a homogeneous
sample there is a specific quantitative relation between the change in the
oscillator's frequency and its maximum damping at the apparent supersolid
transition. Much of the published data do not satisfy this relation, indicating
that the dissipation peaks in those samples are strongly inhomogeneously
broadened.",2007-02-09T15:14:31Z
"Critical temperature modification of low dimensional superconductors by
  spin doping","Ion implantation of Fe and Mn into Al thin films was used for effective
modification of Al superconductive properties. Critical temperature of the
transition to superconducting state was found to decrease gradually with
implanted Fe concentration. it was found that suppression by Mn implantation
much stronger compared to Fe. At low concentrations of implanted ions,
suppression of the critical temperature can be described with reasonable
accuracy by existing models, while at concentrations above 0.1 at.% a
pronounced discrepancy between the models and experiments is observed.",2007-03-14T11:49:19Z
"A time-dependent density functional theory scheme for efficient
  calculations of dynamic (hyper)polarizabilities","We present an efficient perturbative method to obtain both static and dynamic
polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities of complex electronic systems. This
approach is based on the solution of a frequency dependent Sternheimer
equation, within the formalism of time-dependent density functional theory, and
allows the calculation of the response both in resonance and out of resonance.
Furthermore, the excellent scaling with the number of atoms opens the way to
the investigation of response properties of very large molecular systems. To
demonstrate the capabilities of this method, we implemented it in a real-space
(basis-set free) code, and applied it to benchmark molecules, namely CO, H2O,
and paranitroaniline (PNA). Our results are in agreement with experimental and
previous theoretical studies, and fully validate our approach.",2007-01-25T19:05:59Z
"Theory of conserved spin current and its application to two dimensional
  hole gas","We present a detailed microscopic theory of the conserved spin current which
is introduced by us [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{96}, 196602 (2006)] and satisfies
the spin continuity equation even for spin-orbit coupled systems. The spin
transport coefficients $\sigma_{\mu\nu}^{s}$ as a response to the electric
field are shown to consist of two parts, i.e., the conventional part
$\sigma_{\mu\nu}^{s0}$ and the spin torque dipole correction $\sigma_{\mu\nu
}^{s\tau}$. As one key result, an Onsager relation between $\sigma_{\mu\nu
}^{s}$ and other kinds of transport coefficients are shown. The expression for
$\sigma_{\mu\nu}^{s}$ in terms of single-particle Bloch states are derived, by
use of which we study the conserved spin Hall conductivity in the two
dimensional hole gas modeled by a combined Luttinger and SIA Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. It is shown that the two components in spin Hall conductivity usually
have the opposite contributions. While in the absence of Rashba spin splitting,
the spin Hall transport is dominated by the conventional contribution, the
presence of Rashba spin splitting stirs up a large enhancement of the spin
torque dipole correction, leading to an overall sign change for the total spin
Hall conductivity. Furthermore, an approximate two-band calculation and the
subsequent comparison with the exact four-band results are given, which reveals
that the coupling between the heavy hole and light hole bands should be taken
into account for strong Rashba spin splitting.",2007-01-13T06:48:50Z
No hair theorems for positive Λ,"We extend all known black hole no-hair theorems to space-times endowed with a
positive cosmological constant $\Lambda.$ Specifically, we prove that static
spherical black holes with $\Lambda>0$ cannot support scalar fields in convex
potentials and Proca-massive vector fields in the region between black hole and
cosmic horizons. We also demonstrate the existence of at least one type of
quantum hair, and of exactly one charged solution for the Abelian Higgs model.
Our method of proof can be applied to investigate other types of quantum or
topological hair on black holes in the presence of a positive $\Lambda.$",2007-02-01T12:12:13Z
Novel metallic and insulating states at a bent quantum Hall junction,"A non-planar geometry for the quantum Hall (QH) effect is studied, whereby
two quantum Hall (QH) systems are joined at a sharp right angle. When both
facets are at equal filling factor nu the junction hosts a channel with
non-quantized conductance, dependent on nu. The state is metallic at nu = 1/3,
with conductance along the junction increasing as the temperature T drops. At
nu = 1, 2 it is strongly insulating, and at nu = 3, 4 shows only weak T
dependence. Upon applying a dc voltage bias along the junction, the
differential conductance again shows three different behaviors. Hartree
calculations of the dispersion at the junction illustrate possible
explanations, and differences from planar QH structures are highlighted.",2007-01-13T13:21:11Z
Microwave-Induced Cooling of a Superconducting Qubit,"We demonstrated microwave-induced cooling in a superconducting flux qubit.
The thermal population in the first-excited state of the qubit is driven to a
higher-excited state by way of a sideband transition. Subsequent relaxation
into the ground state results in cooling. Effective temperatures as low as
Teff~ 3 millikelvin are achieved for bath temperatures Tbath = 30 - 400
millikelvin, a cooling factor between 10 and 100. This demonstration provides
an analog to optical cooling of trapped ions and atoms and is generalizable to
other solid-state quantum systems. Active cooling of qubits, applied to quantum
information science, provides a means for qubit-state preparation with improved
fidelity and for suppressing decoherence in multi-qubit systems.",2007-02-08T01:14:40Z
"Orbital contribution to the magnetic properties of iron as a function of
  dimensionality","The orbital contribution to the magnetic properties of Fe in systems of
decreasing dimensionality (bulk, surfaces, wire and free clusters) is
investigated using a tight-binding hamiltonian in an $s, p,$ and $d$ atomic
orbital basis set including spin-orbit coupling and intra-atomic electronic
interactions in the full Hartree-Fock (HF) scheme, i.e., involving all the
matrix elements of the Coulomb interaction with their exact orbital dependence.
Spin and orbital magnetic moments and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy
(MAE) are calculated for several orientations of the magnetization. The results
are systematically compared with those of simplified hamiltonians which give
results close to those obtained from the local spin density approximation. The
full HF decoupling leads to much larger orbital moments and MAE which can reach
values as large as 1$\mu_B$ and several tens of meV, respectively, in the
monatomic wire at the equilibrium distance. The reliability of the results
obtained by adding the so-called Orbital Polarization Ansatz (OPA) to the
simplified hamiltonians is also discussed. It is found that when the spin
magnetization is saturated the OPA results for the orbital moment are in
qualitative agreement with those of the full HF model. However there are large
discrepancies for the MAE, especially in clusters. Thus the full HF scheme must
be used to investigate the orbital magnetism and MAE of low dimensional
systems.",2007-03-22T10:20:08Z
The source coding game with a cheating switcher,"Berger's paper `The Source Coding Game', IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 1971,
considers the problem of finding the rate-distortion function for an
adversarial source comprised of multiple known IID sources. The adversary,
called the `switcher', was allowed only causal access to the source
realizations and the rate-distortion function was obtained through the use of a
type covering lemma. In this paper, the rate-distortion function of the
adversarial source is described, under the assumption that the switcher has
non-causal access to all source realizations. The proof utilizes the type
covering lemma and simple conditional, random `switching' rules. The
rate-distortion function is once again the maximization of the R(D) function
for a region of attainable IID distributions.",2007-01-05T05:38:13Z
"Exploiting Locally Imposed Anisotropies in (Ga,Mn)As: a Non-volatile
  Memory Device","Progress in (Ga,Mn)As lithography has recently allowed us to realize
structures where unique magnetic anisotropy properties can be imposed locally
in various regions of a given device. We make use of this technology to
fabricate a device in which we study transport through a constriction
separating two regions whose magnetization direction differs by 90 degrees. We
find that the resistance of the constriction depends on the flow of the
magnetic field lines in the constriction region and demonstrate that such a
structure constitutes a non-volatile memory device.",2007-01-19T13:46:17Z
"String excitations of a hole in a quantum antiferromagnet and
  photoelectron spectrospopy","The aim of the present paper is twofold. The first goal is to show that high
resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectra from cuprates indicate the
presence of string-like excitations of the quasihole excitation in a quantum
antiferromagnet. In order to compare with the experimental intensity plots, we
calculate the spectral function of the t-J and the t-t'-t""-J models within the
self-consistent Born approximation for widely accepted values of the parameters
of these models. The main features of the high resolution photoelectron spectra
are in general agreement with the results based on the above models and can be
understood by considering not only the lowest energy quasiparticle peak but,
also, the higher energy string-like excitations of the hole. The second goal of
the present paper is to make the case that a proper analysis of both the
numerical results obtained from these models and of the experimental results,
suggests a theoretical picture for the internal structure of the
hole-quasiparticle and a string-exchange pairing mechanism due to strong
antiferromagnetic correlations among the background spins. We find that, using
a simple model in which the Hilbert space is restricted to states of only
unbroken strings attached to the holes and in which the holes are connected
with unbroken strings, we can provide a good quantitative description of the
most accurate numerical results. We find that the holes experience an effective
interaction due to a string-exchange mechanism which is characterized by a
rather large string tension and this can provide pairing energy scales much
larger that those suggested by spin-fluctuation mediated pairing models. In
addition, it is argued that such string-exchange interaction tends to bind
holes in a bound state with the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry.",2007-02-12T20:38:14Z
"Quantum criticality and minimal conductivity in graphene with long-range
  disorder","We consider the conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ of graphene with negligible
intervalley scattering at half filling. We derive the effective field theory,
which, for the case of a potential disorder, is a symplectic-class
$\sigma$-model including a topological term with $\theta=\pi$. As a
consequence, the system is at a quantum critical point with a universal value
of the conductivity of the order of $e^2/h$. When the effective time reversal
symmetry is broken, the symmetry class becomes unitary, and $\sigma_{xx}$
acquires the value characteristic for the quantum Hall transition.",2007-02-05T20:39:18Z
"Effects of Disorder on Charge Orderings and Superconductivity in the
  System of Coexisting Itinerant Electrons and Local Pairs","We study the phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of a system of
coexisting itinerant electrons and local pairs (LP), in the presence of
diagonal disorder. The model considered takes into account both the charge
exchange couplings, responsible for superconducting orderings, and the
density-density interactions, which can stabilize charge ordered states in the
system. Depending on the strength of the random on-site potential, the
interactions and the particle concentrations the model is found to exhibit
several various phases, including the homogeneous ones: superconducting (SC),
charge density wave (CDW) and nonordered (NO), as well as the phase separated
states (CDW-SC and CDW-NO).",2007-02-21T09:42:32Z
Strong Correlation Effects in the Fullerene C20,"The smallest fullerene, dodecahedral C20, is studied using a one band Hubbard
model parameterized by U/t. Results are obtained using exact diagonalization of
matrices with linear dimensions as large as 5.7 x 10^9, supplemented by quantum
Monte Carlo. We report the magnetic and spectral properties of C20 as a
function of U/t and investigate electronic pair binding. Solid forms of C20 are
studied using cluster perturbation theory and evidence is found for a
metal-insulator transition at U ~ 4t. We also investigate the relevance of
strong correlations to the Jahn-Teller effect in C20.",2007-01-29T21:02:07Z
Single molecule pulling with large time steps,"Recently, we presented a generalisation of the Jarzynski non-equilibrium work
theorem for phase space mappings. The formalism shows that one can determine
free energy differences from approximate trajectories obtained from molecular
dynamics simulations in which very large timesteps are used. In this work we
test the method by simulating the force induced unfolding of a deca-alanine
helix in vacuum. The excellent agreement between results obtained with a small,
conservative time step of 0.5 fs and results obtained with a time step of 3.2
fs (i.e., close to the stability limit) indicates that the large time step
approach is practical for such complex biomolecules. We further adapt the
method of Hummer and Szabo for the simulation of single-molecule force
spectroscopy experiments to the large time step method. While trajectories
generated with large steps are approximate and may be unphysical - in the
simulations presented here we observe a violation of the equipartition theorem
- the computed free energies are exact in principle. In terms of efficiency,
the optimum time step for the unfolding simulations lies in the range 1-3 fs.",2007-01-30T12:26:02Z
"On the checkerboard pattern and the autocorrelation of photoemission
  data in high temperature superconductors","In the pseudogap state the spectrum of the autocorrelation of angle resolved
photoemission (AC-ARPES) data of Bi2212 presents non-dispersive peaks in
momentum space which compare well with those responsible of the checkerboard
pattern found in the density of states by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. This
similarity suggests that the checkerboard pattern originates from peaks in the
joint density of states, as the dispersive peaks found in the superconducting
state do. Here we show that the experimental AC-ARPES spectrum can be
reproduced within a model for the pseudogap with no charge-ordering or symmetry
breaking. We predict that, because of the competition of superconductivity and
pseudogap, in the superconducting state, the AC-ARPES data of underdoped
cuprates will present both dispersive and non-dispersive peaks and they will be
better observed in cuprates with low critical temperature. We finally argue
that the AC-ARPES data is a complementary and convenient way to measure the arc
length.",2007-02-05T16:29:26Z
"Classical and quantum two-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg
  antiferromagnets","The classical and the quantum, spin $S=1/2, versions of the uniaxially
anisotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice in a field parallel
to the easy axis are studied using Monte Carlo techniques. For the classical
version, attention is drawn to biconical structures and fluctuations at low
temperatures in the transition region between the antiferromagnetic and
spin-flop phases. For the quantum version, the previously proposed scenario of
a first-order transition between the antiferromagnetic and spin-flop phases
with a critical endpoint and a tricritical point is scrutinized.",2007-03-05T20:32:57Z
"Conjugate Gradient Projection Approach for Multi-Antenna Gaussian
  Broadcast Channels","It has been shown recently that the dirty-paper coding is the optimal
strategy for maximizing the sum rate of multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian
broadcast channels (MIMO BC). Moreover, by the channel duality, the nonconvex
MIMO BC sum rate problem can be transformed to the convex dual MIMO
multiple-access channel (MIMO MAC) problem with a sum power constraint. In this
paper, we design an efficient algorithm based on conjugate gradient projection
(CGP) to solve the MIMO BC maximum sum rate problem. Our proposed CGP algorithm
solves the dual sum power MAC problem by utilizing the powerful concept of
Hessian conjugacy. We also develop a rigorous algorithm to solve the projection
problem. We show that CGP enjoys provable convergence, nice scalability, and
great efficiency for large MIMO BC systems.",2007-01-09T05:15:56Z
Dissipation can enhance quantum effects,"Usually one finds that dissipation tends to make a quantum system more
classical in nature. In this paper we study the effect of momentum dissipation
on a quantum system. The momentum of the particle is coupled bilinearly to the
momenta of a harmonic oscillator heat bath. For a harmonic oscillator system we
find that the position and momentum variances for momentum coupling are
respectively identical to momentum and position variances for spatial friction.
This implies that momentum coupling leads to an increase in the fluctuations in
position as the temperature is lowered, exactly the opposite of the classical
like localization of the oscillator, found with spatial friction. For a
parabolic barrier, momentum coupling causes an {\it increase} in the unstable
normal mode barrier frequency, as compared to the lowering of the barrier
frequency in the presence of purely spatial coupling. This increase in the
frequency leads to an enhancement of the thermal tunneling flux, which below
the crossover temperature becomes exponentially large. The crossover
temperature between tunneling and thermal activation {\it increases} with
momentum friction so that quantum effects in the escape are relevant at higher
temperatures.",2007-02-08T12:25:13Z
Thermodynamic Entropy and Chaos in a Discrete Hydrodynamical System,"We show that the thermodynamic entropy density is proportional to the largest
Lyapunov ex- ponent (LLE) of a discrete hydrodynamical system, a deterministic
two-dimensional lattice gas automaton. The definition of the LLE for cellular
automata is based on the concept of Boolean derivatives and is formally
equivalent to that of continuous dynamical systems. This relation is jus-
tified using a Markovian model. In an irreversible process with an initial
density difference between both halves of the system, we find that Boltzmann's
H function is linearly related to the expansion factor of the LLE, although the
latter is more sensitive to the presence of traveling waves.",2007-02-04T10:45:26Z
Negative refraction in nonlinear wave systems,"People have been familiar with the phenomenon of wave refraction for several
centuries. Recently, a novel type of refraction, i.e., negative refraction,
where both incident and refractory lines locate on the same side of the normal
line, has been predicted and realized in the context of linear optics in the
presence of both right- and left-handed materials. In this work, we reveal, by
theoretical prediction and numerical verification, negative refraction in
nonlinear oscillatory systems. We demonstrate that unlike what happens in
linear optics, negative refraction of nonlinear waves does not depend on the
presence of the special left-handed material, but depends on suitable physical
condition. Namely, this phenomenon can be observed in wide range of oscillatory
media under the Hopf bifurcation condition. The complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation and a chemical reaction-diffusion model are used to demonstrate the
feasibility of this nonlinear negative refraction behavior in practice.",2007-01-05T12:27:18Z
On the parameters of the Kerr-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter space-time,"Different forms of the metric for the Kerr-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter space-time
are being widely used in its extension to higher dimensions. The purpose of
this note is to relate the parameters that are being used to the physical
parameters (mass, rotation, NUT and cosmological constant) in the basic four
dimensional situation.",2007-02-07T14:35:36Z
"A thin disk in higher dimensional space-time and dark matter
  interpretation","We find a family of exact solutions of Einstein equations describing the
field of a static axisymmetric thin disk living in six-dimensional space-time.
In particular, we study the disks constructed (by cutting out the central part
of the spacetime) from the conventional Schwarzschild and Chazy-Curzon
solutions with simple extensions in the extra 2 dimensions. The disks are
interpreted in terms of two counter-rotating streams of particles on free
circular orbits. Two extra parameters -- the constants of motion resulting from
projections of the particle-velocities' extra components -- are constrained by
the requirement that the orbits within the disk be stable. The requirement is
met just in cases when the radial profile of the disk orbital speed fits the
rotation curves of many spiral galaxies. It thus turns out that the effective
modification of the gravity law by extra dimensions could explain the observed
flatness of these curves equally well as the usually given dark-matter
interpretation. In the second part of the paper we show that the inclusion of
extra dimensions also leads to better fits of the gravitational-lensing data
for galaxy clusters, without changing results obtained in solar-system scales.
Finally, we discuss whether the effect of extra dimensions could also be
translated as following from the occurrence of extra matter (""Kaluza-Klein
particles""). A comment on possible properties of such particles and a chance to
detect them at LHC is given in the appendix.",2007-03-18T16:14:15Z
Upper limits to the water abundance in starburst galaxies,"We have searched for emission from the 557 GHz ortho-water line in the
interstellar medium of six nearby starburst galaxies. We used the Odin
satellite to observe the 1_10-1_01 transition of o-H2O in the galaxies NGC253,
IC342, M82, NGC4258, CenA, and M51. None of the galaxies in our sample was
detected. We derive three sigma upper limits to the H2O abundance relative to
H2 ranging from 2e-9 to 1e-8. The best of these upper limits are comparable to
the measured abundance of H$_2$O in the Galactic star forming region W3.
However, if only 10% of the molecular gas is in very dense cores, then the
water abundance limits in the cores themselves would be larger by a factor of
10 i.e. 2e-8 to 1e-7. These observations suggest that detections of H2O
emission in galaxies with the upcoming Herschel Space Observatory are likely to
require on-source integration times of an hour or more except in the very
brightest extragalactic targets such as M82 and NGC253.",2007-03-24T21:23:21Z
"Exciton Ionization, Franz-Keldysh and Stark Effects in Carbon Nanotubes","We calculate the optical properties of carbon nanotubes in an external static
electric field directed along the tube axis. We predict strong Franz-Keldysh
oscillations in the first and second band-to-band absorption peaks, quadratic
Stark effect of the first two excitons, and the field dependence of the bound
exciton ionization rate for a wide range of tube chiralities. We find that the
phonon assisted mechanism dominates the dissociation rate in electro-optical
devices due to the hot optical phonons. We predict a quadratic dependence of
the Sommerfeld factor on the electric field and its increase up to 2000% at the
critical field of the full exciton dissociation.",2007-01-29T22:00:50Z

Pseudo-codeword Landscape,"We discuss the performance of Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes decoded
by means of Linear Programming (LP) at moderate and large
Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNR). Utilizing a combination of the previously
introduced pseudo-codeword-search method and a new ""dendro"" trick, which allows
us to reduce the complexity of the LP decoding, we analyze the dependence of
the Frame-Error-Rate (FER) on the SNR. Under Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP)
decoding the dendro-code, having only checks with connectivity degree three,
performs identically to its original code with high-connectivity checks. For a
number of popular LDPC codes performing over the Additive-White-Gaussian-Noise
(AWGN) channel we found that either an error-floor sets at a relatively low
SNR, or otherwise a transient asymptote, characterized by a faster decay of FER
with the SNR increase, precedes the error-floor asymptote. We explain these
regimes in terms of the pseudo-codeword spectra of the codes.",2007-01-12T23:17:17Z
"Torsional Strain of TaS$_3$ Whiskers on the Charge-Density Waves
  Depinning","We find that electric current $I$ exceeding the threshold value results in
torsion deformation of o-TaS$_3$ samples with one contact freely suspended. The
rotation angle, $\delta \phi$, of the free end achieves several degrees and
exhibits hysteresis as a function of $I$. The sign of $\delta \phi$ depends on
the $I$ polarity; a polar axis along the conducting chains (the {\it c}-axis)
is pointed out. We associate the effect with surface shear of the
charge-density waves (CDW) coupled to the crystal shear. The current-induced
torsional strain could be treated in terms of enormous piezoelectric
coefficients ($>10^{-4}$ cm/V) corresponding to shear. In essence, TaS$_3$
appears to be a ready torsional actuator based on the unique intrinsic property
of the CDW.",2007-02-07T14:28:29Z
0.7 Structure and Zero Bias Anomaly in Ballistic Hole Quantum Wires,"We study the anomalous conductance plateau around $G = 0.7(2e^{2}/h)$ and the
zero-bias anomaly in ballistic hole quantum wires with respect to in-plane
magnetic fields applied parallel $B_{\parallel}$ and perpendicular $B_{\perp}$
to the quantum wire. As seen in electron quantum wires, the magnetic fields
shift the 0.7 structure down to $G = 0.5(2e^{2}/h)$ and simultaneously quench
the zero bias anomaly. However, these effects are strongly dependent on the
orientation of the magnetic field, owing to the highly anisotropic effective
Land\'{e} \emph{g}-factor $g^{*}$ in hole quantum wires. Our results highlight
the fundamental role that spin plays in both the 0.7 structure and zero bias
anomaly.",2007-02-08T13:58:45Z
Tradeoff between decoding complexity and rate for codes on graphs,"We consider transmission over a general memoryless channel, with bounded
decoding complexity per bit under message passing decoding. We show that the
achievable rate is bounded below capacity if there is a finite success in the
decoding in a specified number of operations per bit at the decoder for some
codes on graphs. These codes include LDPC and LDGM codes. Good performance with
low decoding complexity suggests strong local structures in the graphs of these
codes, which are detrimental to the code rate asymptotically. The proof method
leads to an interesting necessary condition on the code structures which could
achieve capacity with bounded decoding complexity. We also show that if a code
sequence achieves a rate epsilon close to the channel capacity, the decoding
complexity scales at least as O(log(1/epsilon).",2007-02-13T03:39:56Z
The main- interpulse interaction of PSR B1702-19,"This paper reports on single-pulse radio observations of PSR B1702-19 and
their implications for pulsar emission theories. These observations were made
with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at 1380 and 328 MHz. The PA-swing
is used to constrain possible geometries of the pulsar and the single-pulse
data is analysed for subpulse modulation correlations between the main pulse
and interpulse. We confirm earlier conclusions that the dipole axis of this
pulsar is almost perpendicular to its rotation axis, and report that both its
main pulse and interpulse are modulated with a periodicity around 10.4 times
the pulsar's rotation. Allowing for the half-period delay between main pulse
and interpulse the modulation is found to be precisely in phase. Despite small
secular variations in the periodicity, the phase-locking continues over all
timescales ranging up to several years. The precision of the phase locking is
difficult for current emission theories to explain if the main pulse and
interpulse originate from opposing magnetic poles. We therefore also explore
the possibility of a bidirectional model, in which all the modulated emission
comes from one pole, but is seen from two sides and slightly displaced by
aberration and time-delay. In this model the unmodulated emission is directed
to us from the opposite pole, requiring the emission of the main pulse to
originate from two different poles. This is difficult to reconcile with the
observed smooth PA-swing. Whichever model turns out to be correct, the answer
will have important implications for emission theories.",2007-03-07T11:03:42Z
"Enhanced magneto-transport at high bias in quasi-magnetic tunnel
  junctions with EuS spin-filter barriers","In quasi-magnetic tunnel junctions (QMTJs) with a EuS spin filter tunnel
barrier between Al and Co electrodes, we observed large magnetoresistance (MR).
The bias dependence shows an abrupt increase of MR ratio in high bias voltage,
which is contrary to conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). This
behavior can be understood as due to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling through the
fully spin-polarized EuS conduction band. The I-V characteristics and bias
dependence of MR calculated using tunneling theory shows excellent agreement
with experiment.",2007-03-12T10:23:26Z
"Optimal Order of Decoding for Max-Min Fairness in $K$-User Memoryless
  Interference Channels","A $K$-user memoryless interference channel is considered where each receiver
sequentially decodes the data of a subset of transmitters before it decodes the
data of the designated transmitter. Therefore, the data rate of each
transmitter depends on (i) the subset of receivers which decode the data of
that transmitter, (ii) the decoding order, employed at each of these receivers.
In this paper, a greedy algorithm is developed to find the users which are
decoded at each receiver and the corresponding decoding order such that the
minimum rate of the users is maximized. It is proven that the proposed
algorithm is optimal.",2007-01-18T20:54:03Z
"Angle-resolved photoemission studies of lattice polaron formation in the
  cuprate Ca2CuO2Cl2","To elucidate the nature of the single-particle excitations in the undoped
parent cuprates, we have performed a detailed study of Ca2CuO2Cl2 using
photoemission spectroscopy. The photoemission lineshapes of the lower Hubbard
band are found to be well-described by a polaron model. By comparing the
lineshape and temperature dependence of the lower Hubbard band with additional
O 2p and Ca 3p states, we conclude that the dominant broadening mechanism
arises from the interaction between the photohole and the lattice. The strength
of this interaction was observed to be strongly anisotropic and may have
important implications for the momentum dependence of the first doped hole
states.",2007-02-23T20:04:36Z
Limits on coupling between dark components,"DM--DE coupling can be a phenomenological indication of a common origin of
the dark cosmic components. In this work we outline a new constraint to
coupled--DE models: the coupling can partially or totally suppress the Meszaros
effect, yielding transfered spectra with quite a soft bending above
$k_{hor,eq}$. Models affected by this anomaly do not show major variation in
the CMB anisotropy spectrum and it is herefore hard to reconcile them with both
CMB and deep sample data, through the same value of the primeval spectral
index.",2007-03-13T11:17:48Z
"Random Matrices, the Ulam Problem, Directed Polymers & Growth Models,
  and Sequence Matching","In these lecture notes I will give a pedagogical introduction to some common
aspects of 4 different problems: (i) random matrices (ii) the longest
increasing subsequence problem (also known as the Ulam problem) (iii) directed
polymers in random medium and growth models in (1+1) dimensions and (iv) a
problem on the alignment of a pair of random sequences. Each of these problems
is almost entirely a sub-field by itself and here I will discuss only some
specific aspects of each of them. These 4 problems have been studied almost
independently for the past few decades, but only over the last few years a
common thread was found to link all of them. In particular all of them share
one common limiting probability distribution known as the Tracy-Widom
distribution that describes the asymptotic probability distribution of the
largest eigenvalue of a random matrix. I will mention here, without
mathematical derivation, some of the beautiful results discovered in the past
few years. Then, I will consider two specific models (a) a ballistic deposition
growth model and (b) a model of sequence alignment known as the Bernoulli
matching model and discuss, in some detail, how one derives exactly the
Tracy-Widom law in these models. The emphasis of these lectures would be on how
to map one model to another. Some open problems are discussed at the end.",2007-01-10T09:17:10Z
"The slow dynamics of glassy materials: Insights from computer
  simulations","The physics of glasses can be studied from many viewpoints, from material
scientists interested in the development of new materials to statistical
physicists inventing new theoretical tools to deal with disordered systems. In
these lectures I described a variety of physical phenomena observed in actual
glassy materials, from disordered magnetic systems to soft gels. Despite the
very large gap between experimental and numerical time windows, I showed that
computer simulations represent an efficient theoretical tool which can shed
light on the microscopic origins of glassy dynamics.",2007-03-02T13:21:10Z
"On the artificial nature of aperiodic variability in XMM-Newton
  observations of M31 X-ray sources and the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 4559
  ULX-7","Context: Power density spectra (PDS) that are characteristic of low mass
X-ray binaries (LMXBs) have been previously reported for M31 X-ray sources,
observed by XMM-Newton. However, we have recently discovered that these PDS
result from the improper addition/subtraction of non-simultaneous lightcurves.
Aims: To understand the properties and origins of the artefact. Methods: We
re-analysed our XMM-Newton observations of M31 with non-simultaneous and
simultaneous lightcurves, then combined simulated lightcurves at various
intensities with various offsets and found that the artefact is more dependent
on the offset than the intensity. Results: The lightcurves produced by the
XMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (SAS) are non-synchronised by default.
This affects not only the combination of lightcurves from the three EPIC
detectors (MOS1, MOS2 and pn), but also background subtraction in the same CCD.
It is therefore imperative that all SAS-generated lightcurves are synchronised
by time filtering, even if the whole observation is to be used. We also find
that the reported timing behaviour for NGC 4559 ULX-7 was also contaminated by
the artefact; there is no significant variability in the correctly-combined
lightcurves of NGC 4559 ULX-7. Hence, the classification of this source as an
intermediate-mass black hole is no longer justified. Conclusions: While
previous timing results from M31 have been proven wrong, and also the broken
power law PDS in NGC 4559 ULX-7, XMM-Newton was able to detect aperiodic
variability in just 3 ks of observations of NGC 5408 ULX1. Hence XMM-Newton
remains a viable tool for analysing variability in extra-galactic X-ray
sources.",2007-03-06T17:14:59Z
So you want to stop time,"A model of a stasis chamber, slowing the passage of time in its interior down
to arbitrarily small rates relative to the outside world, is considered within
classical general relativity. Since the model is adapted from the
Majumdar-Papapetrou spacetime, interior spatial volumes are expanded by the
same factor (cubed) as the rate of time is reduced. Real and apparent
(gravitational) forces as perceived by an interior observer are altered, but in
opposite ways. Comparison with special-relativistic time dilation shows the use
of such a static stasis chamber to be economical only when the most drastic
slowing of time relative to the outside world is desired (d(tau)/dt < 10^{-20})
or when one wants to avoid spending the time needed to accelerate to
relativistic speeds.",2007-01-16T16:55:00Z
Absence of low temperature anomaly on the melting curve of $^4$He,"We have measured the melting pressure and pressure in the liquid at constant
density of ultra-pure $^4$He (0.3 ppb of $^3$He impurities) with the accuracy
of about 0.5 $\mu$bar in the temperature range from 10 to 320 mK. Our
measurements show that the anomaly on the melting curve below 80 mK which we
have recently observed is entirely due to an anomaly in the elastic modulus of
Be-Cu from which our pressure gauge is made of. We thus conclude that the
melting pressure of $^4$He follows the $T^4$ law due to phonons in the whole
temperature range from 10 to 320 mK without any sign of a supersolid
transition.",2007-03-28T06:47:45Z
Crossover in the Slow Decay of Dynamic Correlations in the Lorentz Model,"The long-time behavior of transport coefficients in a model for spatially
heterogeneous media in two and three dimensions is investigated by Molecular
Dynamics simulations. The behavior of the velocity auto-correlation function is
rationalized in terms of a competition of the critical relaxation due to the
underlying percolation transition and the hydrodynamic power-law anomalies. In
two dimensions and in the absence of a diffusive mode, another power law
anomaly due to trapping is found with an exponent -3 instead of -2. Further,
the logarithmic divergence of the Burnett coefficient is corroborated in the
dilute limit; at finite density, however, it is dominated by stronger
divergences.",2007-01-26T16:23:38Z
On the Hydrodynamic Boundary Condition for Superfluid Flow,"We discuss the hydrodynamic boundary condition for a superfluid moving
tangentially to a rough surface. Specifically, we argue that the scattering of
quantum fluctuations off surface roughness affects the nature of the boundary
condition, and that this has important consequences including a new theorized
critical speed and the presence of normal fluid at any nonzero speed, even if
the boundary is held at zero temperature. This hydrodynamic boundary condition
is relevant not only for superfluid helium experiments but also for experiments
with trapped dilute Bose-Einstein condensates, in particular those involving
atomic waveguides near surfaces.",2007-02-28T02:50:34Z
H-H dipole interactions in fcc metals,"It is observed that interstitial hydrogen nucleii on a metallic lattice are
strongly coupled to their near neighbours by the unscreened electromagnetic
field mediating transitions between low-lying states. It is shown that the
dominant interaction is of dipole-dipole character. By means of numerical
calculations based upon published data, it is then shown that in stoichiometric
PdD, in which essentially all interstitial sites are occupied by a deuteron,
certain specific superpositions of many-site product states exist that are
lower in energy than the single-site ground state, suggesting the existence of
a new low temperature phase. Finally, the modified behaviour of the
two-particle wavefunction at small separations is investigated and prelimary
results suggesting a radical narrowing of the effective Coulomb barrier are
presented.",2007-03-27T14:47:21Z
2H-NMR studies of supercooled and glassy aspirin,"Acetyl salicylic acid, deuterated at the methyl group, was investigated using
2H-NMR in its supercooled and glassy states. Just above the glass transition
temperature the molecular reorientations were studied using stimulated-echo
spectroscopy and demonstrated a large degree of similarity with other glass
formers. Deep in the glassy phase the NMR spectra look similar to those
reported for the crystal [A. Detken, P. Focke, H. Zimmermann, U. Haeberlen, Z.
Olejniczak, Z. T. Lalowicz, Z. Naturforsch. A 50 (1995) 95] and below 20 K they
are indicative for rotational tunneling with a relatively large tunneling
frequency. Measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation times for temperatures
below 150 K reveal a broad distribution of correlation times in the glass. The
dominant energy barrier characterizing the slow-down of the methyl group is
significantly smaller than the well defined barrier in the crystal.",2007-01-10T13:06:05Z
The Sun-like activity of the solar twin 18 Scorpii,"We present the results of 10 yr of complementary spectroscopic and
photometric observations of the solar twin 18 Scorpii. We show that over the
course of its ~7 year chromospheric activity cycle, 18 Sco's brightness varies
in the same manner as the Sun's and with a likely brightness variation of
0.09%, similar to the 0.1% decadal variation in the total solar irradiance.",2007-03-16T17:17:01Z
How Overlap Determines the Macronuclear Genes in Ciliates,"Formal models for gene assembly in ciliates have been developed, in
particular the string pointer reduction system (SPRS) and the graph pointer
reduction system (GPRS). The reduction graph is a valuable tool within the
SPRS, revealing much information about how gene assembly is performed for a
given gene. The GPRS is more abstract than the SPRS and not all information
present in the SPRS is retained in the GPRS. As a consequence the reduction
graph cannot be defined for the GPRS in general, but we show that it can be
defined (in an equivalent manner as defined for the SPRS) if we restrict
ourselves to so-called realistic overlap graphs. Fortunately, only these graphs
correspond to genes occurring in nature. Defining the reduction graph within
the GPRS allows one to carry over several results within the SPRS that rely on
the reduction graph.",2007-02-28T15:51:26Z
Firebird Database Backup by Serialized Database Table Dump,"This paper presents a simple data dump and load utility for Firebird
databases which mimics mysqldump in MySQL. This utility, fb_dump and fb_load,
for dumping and loading respectively, retrieves each database table using
kinterbasdb and serializes the data using marshal module. This utility has two
advantages over the standard Firebird database backup utility, gbak. Firstly,
it is able to backup and restore single database tables which might help to
recover corrupted databases. Secondly, the output is in text-coded format (from
marshal module) making it more resilient than a compressed text backup, as in
the case of using gbak.",2007-02-13T11:13:29Z
"Integral method for flows down an incline: viscous, turbulent and
  granular cases","The integral method can be used to model accurately flows down an inclined
plane. Such a method consists in projecting the full 3D equations on a lower
dimensional representation. The vertical velocity profiles have their
functional form fixed, based from the exact solution of homogeneous steady
flows. This projection is achieved by integration of the momentum equation over
the flow depth -- Saint-Venant approach. Here we generalize the viscous case to
two non-newtonian constitutive relations: a Prandtl-like turbulent closure and
a local granular rheology. We discuss one application in each case: the
formation of anti-dunes in viscous streams, the transverse velocity profile in
turbulent channels and the Kapitza instability in dense granular flows. They
demonstrate the usefulness of this approach to get a model qualitatively
correct, quantitatively reasonable and in which the dynamical mechanisms at
work can be easily identified.",2007-01-13T15:42:20Z
"Alternative approach to all-angle negative refraction in two-dimensional
  photonic crystals","We show that with an appropriate surface modification, a slab of photonic
crystal can be made to allow wave transmission within the band gap.
Furthermore, negative refraction and all-angle-negative-refraction (AANR) can
be achieved by this surface modification in frequency windows that were not
realized before in two-dimensional photonic crystals [C. Luo et al, Phys. Rev.
B 65, 201104 (2002)]. This approach to AANR leads to new applications in flat
lens imaging. Previous flat lens using photonic crystals requires object-image
distance u+v less than or equal to the lens thickness d, u+v d. Our approach
can be used to design flat lens with u+v=sd with s>>1, thus being able to image
large and/or far away objects. Our results are confirmed by FDTD simulations.",2007-03-27T23:24:50Z
"Wind-wind collision in the eta Carinae binary system - III. The HeII
  4686 line profile","We modeled the HeII 4686 line profiles observed in the eta Carinae binary
system close to the 2003.5 spectroscopic event, assuming that they were formed
in the shocked gas that flows at both sides of the contact surface formed by
wind-wind collision. We used a constant flow velocity and added turbulence in
the form of a gaussian velocity distribution. We allowed emission from both the
primary and secondary shocks but introduced infinite opacity at the contact
surface, implying that only the side of the contact cone visible to the
observer contributed to the line profile. Using the orbital parameters of the
binary system derived from the 7 mm light curve during the last spectroscopic
event (Paper II) we were able to reproduce the line profiles obtained with the
HST at different epochs, as well as the line mean velocities obtained with
ground based telescopes. A very important feature of our model is that the line
profile depends on the inclination of the orbital plane; we found that to
explain the latitude dependent mean velocity of the line, scattered into the
line of sight by the Homunculus, the orbit inclination should be close to 90
degrees, meaning that it does not lie in the Homunculus equatorial plane, as
usually assumed. This inclination, together with the relative position of the
stars during the spectroscopic events, allowed us to explain most of the
observational features, like the variation of the Purple Haze with the orbital
phase, and to conciliate the X-ray absorption with the postulated shell effect
used to explain the optical and UV light curves.",2007-03-27T18:13:33Z
"MRI Investigations of Particle Motion within a Three-Dimensional
  Vibro-Fluidized Granular Bed","The unique ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide spatial and
temporal information from optically opaque systems, in three dimensions, make
it an ideal tool to study the internal motion of rapid granular flows. This
paper will focus on the use of ultra-fast velocity compensated MRI measurements
to study particle velocity and density distributions in a granular gas,
produced by vibrating vertically a bed of mustard seeds at 40 Hz. Specifically,
a velocity compensated, double spin-echo, triggered, one-dimensional MRI
profiling pulse sequence was developed. This gives an MRI temporal resolution
of approximately 2 ms and also minimises MRI velocity artefacts. 12 phase
measurements per vibration cycle were used. The data can be used to extract
values of the mustard seed average velocity and velocity propagators
(probability distributions functions) as a function of the phase of the
vibration cycle and vertical height within the cell. The data show strong
transient effects during the impact phase of the vibration. A detailed
discussion of the temporal passage of the individual phase resolved, height
resolved velocity distributions, along with seed velocity propagators at a fix
height from the vibrating base is presented.",2007-02-08T11:22:49Z
"Origin of long-ranged attraction between like-charged particles at
  water-air interface","The nature of electrostatic interaction between like-charged particles at
water-air interface is analyzed in this paper. We show that long-ranged
electrostatic dipolar attraction between these objects generally exists. Our
result provides a natural mechanism to explain the experimental observations of
attraction between like-charge species trapped at water-air interface. We
speculate that a similar (but presumably weaker) mechanism also exists for
particles near water-solid interface.",2007-03-26T09:09:33Z
"Solving the De Prony's Problem of Separation of the Overlapping

"Thermoelectric phenomena in a quantum dot asymmetrically coupled to
  external leads","We study thermoelectric phenomena in a system consisting of strongly
correlated quantum dot coupled to external leads in the Kondo regime. We
calculate linear and nonlinear electrical and thermal conductance and
thermopower of the quantum dot and discuss the role of asymmetry in the
couplings to external electrodes. In the linear regime electrical and thermal
conductances are modified, while thermopower remains unchanged. In the
nonlinear regime the Kondo resonance in differential conductance develops at
non-zero source-drain voltage, which has important consequences on
thermoelectric properties of the system and the thermopower starts to depend on
the asymmetry. We also discuss Wiedemann-Franz relation, thermoelectric figure
of merit and validity of the Mott formula for thermopower.",2007-03-16T18:22:07Z
Crystals of Na+ ions at the surface of a silica hydrosol,"I used x-ray grazing incidence diffraction to measure the spatial
correlations between sodium ions adsorbed with Bjerrum's density at the surface
of a monodispersed 22-nm-particle colloidal silica solution stabilized by NaOH
with a total bulk concentration mol/L. My findings show that the surface
compact layer is in a two-dimensional crystalline state (symmetry p2), with

"Study of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth in the cuprate
  superconductor Ca_2-xNa_xCuO_2Cl_2: role of the apical sites","A study of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_ab in a series of
the cuprate superconductors Ca_2-xNa_xCuO_2Cl_2 (Na-CCOC) with Na content
x=0.11, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, and 0.19 is reported. The zero temperature values of
\lambda_ab(0) were obtained by means of the muon-spin rotation technique, as
well as from measurements of the intrinsic susceptibility \chi^int(0) by using
the procedure developed by Kanigel et al. [Phys.Rev.B 71, 224511 (2005)].
\lambda_ab at T=0K was found to increase with decreasing doping from
\lambda_ab(0)=316(19)nm for the x=0.19 sample to \lambda_ab(0)=430(26)nm for
the x=0.11 one. From a comparison of the present Na-CCOC data with those of
Bi2201 and La214 cuprate superconductors it is concluded that substitution of
the apical oxygen by chlorine decreases the coupling between the
superconducting CuO_2 planes, leading to an enhancement of the two-dimensional
properties of Na-CCOC.",2007-03-27T18:54:10Z
Ultrafast Enhancement of Ferromagnetism via Photoexcited Holes in GaMnAs,"We report on the observation of ultrafast photo-enhanced ferromagnetism in
GaMnAs. It is manifested as a transient magnetization increase on a 100-ps time
scale, after an initial sub-ps demagnetization. The dynamic magnetization
enhancement exhibits a maximum below the Curie temperature Tc and dominates the
demagnetization component when approaching Tc. We attribute the observed
ultrafast collective ordering to the p-d exchange interaction between
photoexcited holes and Mn spins, leading to a correlation-induced peak around
20K and a transient increase in Tc.",2007-02-19T14:19:26Z
"Cross-Matching Multiple Spatial Observations and Dealing with Missing
  Data","Cross-match spatially clusters and organizes several astronomical
point-source measurements from one or more surveys. Ideally, each object would
be found in each survey. Unfortunately, the observation conditions and the
objects themselves change continually. Even some stationary objects are missing
in some observations; sometimes objects have a variable light flux and
sometimes the seeing is worse. In most cases we are faced with a substantial
number of differences in object detections between surveys and between
observations taken at different times within the same survey or instrument.
Dealing with such missing observations is a difficult problem. The first step
is to classify misses as ephemeral - when the object moved or simply
disappeared, masked - when noise hid or corrupted the object observation, or
edge - when the object was near the edge of the observational field. This
classification and a spatial library to represent and manipulate observational
footprints help construct a Match table recording both hits and misses.
Transitive closure clusters friends-of-friends into object bundles. The bundle
summary statistics are recorded in a Bundle table. This design is an evolution
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey cross-match design that compared overlapping

"Intrinsic Tunneling Spectra of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$ near
  Optimal Doping","We report tunneling spectra of near optimally doped
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ intrinsic Josephson junctions with area of
0.09 $\mu$m$^2$, which avoid some fundamental difficulties in the previous
tunneling experiments and allow a stable temperature-dependent measurement. A
d-wave Eliashberg analysis shows that the spectrum at 4.2 K can be well fitted
by considering electron couplings to a bosonic magnetic resonance mode and a
broad high-energy continuum. Above $T_c$, the spectra show a clear pseudogap
that persists up to 230 K, and a crossover can be seen indicating two different
pseudogap phases existing above $T_c$. The intrinsic electron tunneling nature
is discussed in the analysis.",2007-03-07T09:56:19Z
"Theory of Layered Iron Oxide on Frustrated Geometry: Electric
  Polarization, Magnetoelectric Effect and Orbital State","A layered iron oxide \rfeo ($R$: rare-earth elements) is an exotic dielectric
material with charge-order (CO) driven electric polarization and
magnetoelectric effect caused by spin-charge coupling. In this paper, a theory
of electronic structure and dielectric property in \rfeo is presented. Charge
frustration in paired-triangular lattices allows a charge imbalance without
inversion symmetry. Spin frustration induces reinforcement of this polar CO by
a magnetic ordering. We also analyze an orbital model for the Fe ion which does
not show a conventional long-range order.",2007-02-05T05:32:53Z
Rashba quantum wire: exact solution and ballistic transport,"The effect of Rashba spin-orbit interaction in quantum wires with hard-wall
boundaries is discussed. The exact wave function and eigenvalue equation are
worked out pointing out the mixing between the spin and spatial parts. The
spectral properties are also studied within the perturbation theory with
respect to the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and diagonalization
procedure. A comparison is done with the results of a simple model, the
two-band model, that takes account only of the first two sub-bands of the wire.
Finally, the transport properties within the ballistic regime are analytically
calculated for the two-band model and through a tight-binding Green function
for the entire system. Single and double interfaces separating regions with
different strengths of spin-orbit interaction are analyzed injecting carriers
into the first and the second sub-band. It is shown that in the case of a
single interface the spin polarization in the Rashba region is different from
zero, and in the case of two interfaces the spin polarization shows
oscillations due to spin selective bound states.",2007-01-21T20:11:53Z
Projection operator formalism and entropy,"The entropy definition is deduced by means of (re)deriving the generalized
non-linear Langevin equation using Zwanzig projector operator formalism. It is
shown to be necessarily related to an invariant measure which, in classical
mechanics, can always be taken to be the Liouville measure. It is not true that
one is free to choose a ``relevant'' probability density independently as is
done in other flavors of projection operator formalism. This observation
induces an entropy expression which is valid also outside the thermodynamic
limit and in far from equilibrium situations. The Zwanzig projection operator
formalism therefore gives a deductive derivation of non-equilibrium, and
equilibrium, thermodynamics. The entropy definition found is closely related to
the (generalized) microcanonical Boltzmann-Planck definition but with some
subtle differences. No ``shell thickness'' arguments are needed, nor desirable,
for a rigorous definition. The entropy expression depends on the choice of
macroscopic variables and does not exactly transform as a scalar quantity. The
relation with expressions used in the GENERIC formalism are discussed.",2007-03-26T11:26:34Z
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging with 90 nm Resolution,"Magnetic resonance imaging, based on the manipulation and detection of
nuclear spins, is a powerful imaging technique that typically operates on the
scale of millimeters to microns. Using magnetic resonance force microscopy, we
have demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging of nuclear spins can be
extended to a spatial resolution better than 100 nm. The two-dimensional
imaging of 19F nuclei was done on a patterned CaF2 test object, and was enabled
by a detection sensitivity of roughly 1200 nuclear spins. To achieve this
sensitivity, we developed high-moment magnetic tips that produced field
gradients up to 1.4x10^6 T/m, and implemented a measurement protocol based on
force-gradient detection of naturally occurring spin fluctuations. The
resulting detection volume of less than 650 zl represents 60,000x smaller
volume than previous NMR microscopy and demonstrates the feasibility of pushing
magnetic resonance imaging into the nanoscale regime.",2007-02-27T23:05:15Z
"High-rate, Multi-Symbol-Decodable STBCs from Clifford Algebras","It is well known that Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) obtained from Orthogonal
Designs (ODs) are single-symbol-decodable (SSD) and from Quasi-Orthogonal
Designs (QODs) are double-symbol decodable. However, there are SSD codes that
are not obtainable from ODs and DSD codes that are not obtainable from QODs. In
this paper a method of constructing $g$-symbol decodable ($g$-SD) STBCs using
representations of Clifford algebras are presented which when specialized to
$g=1,2$ gives SSD and DSD codes respectively. For the number of transmit
antennas $2^a$ the rate (in complex symbols per channel use) of the $g$-SD
codes presented in this paper is $\frac{a+1-g}{2^{a-g}}$. The maximum rate of
the DSD STBCs from QODs reported in the literature is $\frac{a}{2^{a-1}}$ which
is smaller than the rate $\frac{a-1}{2^{a-2}}$ of the DSD codes of this paper,
for $2^a$ transmit antennas. In particular, the reported DSD codes for 8 and 16
transmit antennas offer rates 1 and 3/4 respectively whereas the known STBCs
from QODs offer only 3/4 and 1/2 respectively. The construction of this paper
is applicable for any number of transmit antennas.",2007-02-04T13:07:47Z
Effective forces induced by fluctuating interface: exact results,"We present exact derivations of the effective capillary wave fluctuation

ferromagnet calculations based on the transfer matrix approach give an
attractive force decaying as 1/r for large distances. In three dimensions
mapping of the body-centered solid-on-solid model onto the 6-vertex model
allows for exact solution using the bosonization analysis of the equivalent XXZ
Heisenberg quantum chain. The exact result gives the attractive force which
decays asymptotically as 1/(r\log r).",2007-03-30T12:34:22Z
"Fast initialization of a high-fidelity quantum register using optical
  superlattices","We propose a method for the fast generation of a quantum register of
addressable qubits consisting of ultracold atoms stored in an optical lattice.
Starting with a half filled lattice we remove every second lattice barrier by
adiabatically switching on a superlattice potential which leads to a long
wavelength lattice in the Mott insulator state with unit filling. The larger
periodicity of the resulting lattice could make individual addressing of the
atoms via an external laser feasible. We develop a Bose-Hubbard-like model for
describing the dynamics of cold atoms in a lattice when doubling the lattice
periodicity via the addition of a superlattice potential. The dynamics of the
transition from a half filled to a commensurately filled lattice is analyzed
numerically with the help of the Time Evolving Block Decimation algorithm and
analytically using the Kibble-Zurek theory. We show that the time scale for the
whole process, i.e. creating the half filled lattice and subsequent doubling of
the lattice periodicity, is significantly faster than adiabatic direct quantum
freezing of a superfluid into a Mott insulator for large lattice periods. Our
method therefore provides a high fidelity quantum register of addressable
qubits on a fast time scale.",2007-02-27T16:07:17Z
Generation of Correlated Binary Sequence from White Noise,"We suggest a method for generation of random binary sequences with prescribed
correlation properties. It is based on a kind of modification of the widely
used convolution method of constructing continuous random processes. Apart from
the theoretical interest, this method can be used in various applications such
as the design of one-dimensional devices giving rise to selective transport
properties.",2007-02-09T03:30:46Z
"Interaction Between Motor Domains Can Explain the Complex Dynamics of
  Heterodimeric Kinesins","Motor proteins are active enzyme molecules that play a crucial role in many
biological processes. They transform the chemical energy into the mechanical
work and move unidirectionally along rigid cytoskeleton filaments.
Single-molecule experiments suggest that motor proteins, consisting of two
motor domains, move in a hand-over-hand mechanism when each subunit changes
between trailing and leading positions in alternating steps, and these subunits
do not interact with each other. However, recent experiments on heterodimeric
kinesins suggest that the motion of motor domains is not independent, but
rather strongly coupled and coordinated, although the mechanism of these
interactions are not known. We propose a simple discrete stochastic model to
describe the dynamics of homodimeric and heterodimeric two-headed motor
proteins. It is argued that interactions between motor domains modify free
energy landscapes of each motor subunit, and motor proteins still move via the
hand-over-hand mechanism but with different transitions rates. Our calculations
of biophysical properties agree with experimental observations. Several ways to
test the theoretical model are proposed.",2007-03-22T15:23:22Z
"Asymptotic Analysis of Amplify and Forward Relaying in a Parallel MIMO
  Relay Network","This paper considers the setup of a parallel MIMO relay network in which $K$
relays, each equipped with $N$ antennas, assist the transmitter and the
receiver, each equipped with $M$ antennas, in the half-duplex mode, under the
assumption that $N\geq{M}$. This setup has been studied in the literature like
in \cite{nabar}, \cite{nabar2}, and \cite{qr}. In this paper, a simple scheme,
the so-called Incremental Cooperative Beamforming, is introduced and shown to
achieve the capacity of the network in the asymptotic case of $K\to{\infty}$
with a gap no more than $O(\frac{1}{\log(K)})$. This result is shown to hold,
as long as the power of the relays scales as $\omega(\frac{\log^9(K)}{K})$.
Finally, the asymptotic SNR behavior is studied and it is proved that the
proposed scheme achieves the full multiplexing gain, regardless of the number
of relays.",2007-03-30T06:47:21Z
"Thermopower of Kondo Effect in Single Quantum Dot Systems with Orbital
  at Finite Temperatures","We investigate the thermopower due to the orbital Kondo effect in a single
quantum dot system by means of the noncrossing approximation. It is elucidated
how the asymmetry of tunneling resonance due to the orbital Kondo effect
affects the thermopower under gate-voltage and magnetic-field control.",2007-01-22T21:02:29Z
Enhanced Weiss oscillations in graphene,"The magneto-conductivity of a single graphene layer where the electrons are
described by the Dirac Hamiltonian weakly modulated by a periodic potential is
calculated. It is shown that Weiss oscillations periodic in the inverse
magnetic field appear, that are more pronounced and less damped with the
increment of temperature as compared with the same oscillations in a typical
two-dimensional electron system with a standard parabolic energy spectrum.",2007-01-09T14:29:06Z
Quantum Radiation from Quantum Gravitational Collapse,"We study quantum radiation emitted during the collapse of a quantized,
gravitating, spherical domain wall. The amount of radiation emitted during
collapse now depends on the wavefunction of the collapsing wall and the
background spacetime. If the wavefunction is initially in the form of a sharp
wavepacket, the expectation value of the particle occupation number is
determined as a function of time and frequency. The results are in good
agreement with our earlier semiclassical analysis and show that the quantum
radiation is non-thermal and evaporation accompanies gravitational collapse.",2007-01-16T21:11:04Z
"Heteropolymer Sequence Design and Preferential Solvation of Hydrophilic
  Monomers: One More Application of Random Energy Model","In this paper, we study the role of surface of the globule and the role of
interactions with the solvent for designed sequence heteropolymers using random
energy model (REM). We investigate the ground state energy and surface monomer
composition distribution. By comparing the freezing transition in random and
designed sequence heteropolymers, we discuss the effects of design. Based on
our results, we are able to show under which conditions solvation effect
improves the quality of sequence design. Finally, we study sequence space
entropy and discuss the number of available sequences as a function of imposed
requirements for the design quality.",2007-01-24T04:43:59Z
"Analytic theory of pair distribution functions in symmetric
  electron-electron and electron-hole bilayers","We present a self-consistent analytic theory of the intra-layer and
inter-layer pair correlation functions in electron-electron and electron-hole
fluid bilayer systems. Our approach involves the solution of a zero-energy
scattering Schroedinger equation with an effective potential which includes a
Bose-like term from Jastrow-Feenberg correlations and a Fermi term from kinetic
energy and exchange, tailored to yield the Hartree-Fock limit at high carrier
density. The theory is also shown to satisfy the plasmon sum rule and the
charge neutrality condition. We obtain good agreement with the available
Quantum Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) data in symmetric bilayers over a wide
range of carrier density and layer spacing, and stress the role of three-body
correlation terms in yielding fully quantitative agreement at strong coupling.
Signals of impending transitions to density-modulated states at strong coupling
and low layer spacing appear in the calculated pair correlations through
inter-layer in-phase oscillations for electron-hole bilayers and out-of-phase
oscillations for electron-electron bilayers, in agreement with the DMC
findings.",2007-02-14T10:51:24Z
Organic Spintronics,"In this paper we review the recent field of organic spintronics, where
organic materials are applied as a medium to transport and control
spin-polarized signals. The contacts for injecting and detecting spins are
formed by metals, oxides, or inorganic semiconductors. First, the basic
concepts of spintronics and organic electronics are addressed and phenomena
which are in particular relevant for organic spintronics are highlighted.
Experiments using different organic materials, including carbon nanotubes,
organic thin films, self-assembled monolayers and single molecules are then
reviewed. Observed magnetoresistance points toward successful spin injection
and detection, but spurious magnetoresitance effects can easily be confused
with spin accumulation. A few studies report long spin relaxation times and
lengths, which forms a promising basis for further research. We conclude with
discussing outstanding questions and problems.",2007-03-19T11:48:06Z
Spin-2 particles in gravitational fields,"We give a solution of the wave equation for massless, or massive spin-2
particles propagating in a gravitational background. The solution is covariant,
gauge-invariant and exact to first order in the background gravitational field.
The background contribution is confined to a phase factor from which
geometrical and physical optics can be derived. The phase also describes
Mashhoon's spin-rotation coupling and, in general, the spin-gravity
interaction.",2007-02-01T15:57:49Z
Multiparticle tunneling in diffusive superconducting junctions,"We formulate a theoretical framework to describe multiparticle current
transport in planar superconducting tunnel junctions with diffusive electrodes.
The approach is based on direct solving of quasiclassical Keldysh-Green
function equations for nonequilibrium superconductors, and consists of a
combination of a circuit theory analysis and improved perturbation expansion.
The theory predicts much greater scaling parameter for the subharmonic gap
structure of the tunnel current in diffusive junctions compared to the one in
ballistic junctions and mesoscopic constrictions with the same barrier
transparency.",2007-01-09T14:28:21Z
The Helium abundance and Delta Y / Delta Z in Lower Main Sequence stars,"We use nearby K dwarf stars to measure the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio,
a diagnostic of the chemical history of the Solar Neighbourhood. Our sample of
K dwarfs has homogeneously determined effective temperatures, bolometric
luminosities and metallicities, allowing us to fit each star to the appropriate
stellar isochrone and determine its helium content indirectly. We use a newly
computed set of Padova isochrones which cover a wide range of helium and metal
content. Our theoretical isochrones have been checked against a congruous set
of main sequence binaries with accurately measured masses, to discuss and
validate their range of applicability. We find that the stellar masses deduced
from the isochrones are usually in excellent agreement with empirical
measurements. Good agreement is also found with empirical mass-luminosity
relations. Despite fitting the masses of the stars very well, we find that
anomalously low helium content (lower than primordial helium) is required to
fit the luminosities and temperatures of the metal poor K dwarfs, while more
conventional values of the helium content are derived for the stars around
solar metallicity. We have investigated the effect of diffusion in stellar
models and LTE assumption in deriving metallicities. Neither of these is able
to resolve the low helium problem alone and only marginally if the cumulated
effects are included, unless we assume a mixing-length which is strongly
decreasing with metallicity. Further work in stellar models is urgently needed.
The helium-to-metal enrichment ratio is found to be Delta Y / Delta Z = 2.1 +/-
0.9 around and above solar metallicity, consistent with previous studies,
whereas open problems still remain at the lowest metallicities. Finally, we
determine the helium content for a set of planetary host stars.",2007-03-29T16:18:55Z
"Fluctuation and gauge effects on the critical behavior of
  superconductors","Gauge effects on the fluctuation properties of the normal-to-superconducting
phase transition in bulk and thin film superconductors are reviewed. Similar
problems in the description of other natural systems (liquid crystals, quantum
field theory, early universe) are also discussed. The relatively strong gauge
effects on the fluctuations of the ordering field at low spatial dimensionality
$D$ and, in particular, in thin (quasi-2D) films are considered in details. A
special attention is paid to the fluctuations of the gauge field. It is shown
that the mechanism, in which these gauge fluctuations affect the phase
transition order and other phase transition properties varies with the
variation of spatial dimensionality $D$. The problem for the experimental
confirmation of theoretical predictions about the order of phase transitions in
gauge systems is discussed. Related topics: gauge effects on the critical
behavior of unconventional superconductors, disorder, quantum fluctuations in a
close vicinity of ultra-low phase transition temperatures, are also briefly
discussed.",2007-01-12T09:52:45Z
"Peak Luminosities of the Hard States of GX 339-4: Implications for the
  Accretion Geometry, Disk Mass, and Black Hole Mass","We have analyzed observations of the black hole transient {GX 339$-$4} made
with the {\it Rossi} X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the Burst and Transient
Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory (CGRO). We
have found a nearly linear relation between the peak flux during the low/hard
(LH) state that occurs at the beginning of an outburst and the time since the
flux peak of the latest LH state identified in the previous outburst. Assuming
that the rate at which mass accumulates in the accretion disk between these
peaks is constant and that any mass that remains in the disk after an outburst
has a negligible effect on the next outburst, this nearly linear relation
suggests that the peak flux during the LH state that occurs at the beginning of
an outburst is related to the mass in the disk, and thus that the entire disk
is probably involved in powering these LH states. We have also found a positive
correlation between the peak luminosities of the LH state in the three recent
outbursts of {GX 339$-$4} and the peak luminosities of the following HS state.
This correlation is similar to the correlations reported previously for {Aql
X$-$1}, {4U 1705$-$44}, and {XTE J1550$-$564}, providing further support that
the accretion flow that powers the LH state is related to the accretion flow
that powers the following HS state. Although the luminosity of the LH-to-HS
transition varies by up to an order of magnitude, the neutron stars and the
black holes are distinguishable in the state transition luminosity. We discuss
the implications for the mass determination of the compact stars in the
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs).",2007-03-15T06:31:30Z
"Supporting Finite Element Analysis with a Relational Database Backend,
  Part I: There is Life beyond Files","In this paper, we show how to use a Relational Database Management System in
support of Finite Element Analysis. We believe it is a new way of thinking
about data management in well-understood applications to prepare them for two
major challenges, - size and integration (globalization). Neither extreme size
nor integration (with other applications over the Web) was a design concern 30
years ago when the paradigm for FEA implementation first was formed. On the
other hand, database technology has come a long way since its inception and it
is past time to highlight its usefulness to the field of scientific computing
and computer based engineering. This series aims to widen the list of
applications for database designers and for FEA users and application
developers to reap some of the benefits of database development.",2007-01-25T23:02:32Z
"Direct measurement of the effective charge in nonpolar suspensions by
  optical tracking of single particles","We demonstrate a novel technique for the measurement of the charge carried by
a colloidal particle. The technique uses the phenomenon of the resonance of a
particle held in an optical tweezers trap and driven by a sinusoidal electric
field. The trapped particle forms a strongly damped harmonic oscillator whose
fluctuations are a function of $\gamma$, the ratio of the root-mean square
average of the electric and thermal forces on the particle. At low applied
fields, where $\gamma \ll 1$, the particle is confined to the optical axis
while at high fields ($\gamma \gg 1$) the probability distribution of the
particle is double-peaked. The periodically-modulated thermal fluctuations are
measured with nanometer sensitivity using an interferometric position detector.
Charges, as low as a few elementary charges, can be measured with an
uncertainty of about 0.25 $e$. This is significantly better than previous
techniques and opens up new possibilities for the study of nonpolar
suspensions.",2007-01-26T13:05:14Z
Reasoning from a schema and from an analog in software code reuse,"The activity of design involves the decomposition of problems into
subproblems and the development and evaluation of solutions. In many cases,
solution development is not done from scratch. Designers often evoke and adapt
solutions developed in the past. These solutions may come from an internal
source, i.e. the memory of the designers, and/or from an external source. The
goal of this paper is to analyse the characteristics of the cognitive
mechanisms, the knowledge and the representations involved in the code reuse
activity performed by experienced programmers. More generally, the focus is the
control structure of the reuse activity. Data collected in an experiment in
which programmers had to design programs are analyzed. Two code reuse
situations are distinguished depending on whether or not the processes involved
in reuse start before the elaboration of what acts as a source-solution. Our
analysis highlights the use of reasoning from a schema and from an analog in
the code reuse activity.",2007-01-31T16:41:02Z
Kallen-Lehman approach to 3D Ising model,"A ""Kallen-Lehman"" approach to Ising model, inspired by quantum field theory a
la Regge, is proposed. The analogy with the Kallen-Lehman representation leads
to a formula for the free-energy of the 3D model with few free parameters which
could be matched with the numerical data. The possible application of this
scheme to the spin glass case is shortly discussed.",2007-01-08T22:06:59Z
"Extraction of cartographic objects in high resolution satellite images
  for object model generation","The aim of this study is to detect man-made cartographic objects in
high-resolution satellite images. New generation satellites offer a sub-metric
spatial resolution, in which it is possible (and necessary) to develop methods
at object level rather than at pixel level, and to exploit structural features
of objects. With this aim, a method to generate structural object models from
manually segmented images has been developed. To generate the model from
non-segmented images, extraction of the objects from the sample images is
required. A hybrid method of extraction (both in terms of input sources and
segmentation algorithms) is proposed: A region based segmentation is applied on
a 10 meter resolution multi-spectral image. The result is used as marker in a
""marker-controlled watershed method using edges"" on a 2.5 meter resolution
panchromatic image. Very promising results have been obtained even on images
where the limits of the target objects are not apparent.",2007-03-12T15:57:23Z
"Scaling behavior of the energy gap of spin-1/2 AF-Heisenberg chain in
  both uniform and staggered fields","We have studied the energy gap of the 1D AF-Heisenberg model in the presence
of both uniform ($H$) and staggered ($h$) magnetic fields using the exact
diagonalization technique. We have found that the opening of the gap in the
presence of a staggered field scales with $h^{\nu}$, where $\nu=\nu(H)$ is the
critical exponent and depends on the uniform field. With respect to the range
of the staggered magnetic field, we have identified two regimes through which
the $H$-dependence of the real critical exponent $\nu(H)$ can be numerically
calculated. Our numerical results are in good agreement with the results
obtained by theoretical approaches.",2007-01-17T07:35:57Z
Feedback cooling of a cantilever's fundamental mode below 5 mK,"We cool the fundamental mechanical mode of an ultrasoft silicon cantilever
from a base temperature of 2.2 K to 2.9 +/- 0.3 mK using active optomechanical
feedback. The lowest observed mode temperature is consistent with limits
determined by the properties of the cantilever and by the measurement noise.
For high feedback gain, the driven cantilever motion is found to suppress or
""squash"" the optical interferometer intensity noise below the shot noise level.",2007-02-20T00:49:26Z
"Confined photon modes with triangular symmetry in hexagonal
  microcavities in 2D photonic Crystals","We present theoretical and experimental studies of the size and thickness
dependencies of the optical emission spectra from microcavities with hexagonal
shape in films of two-dimensional photonic crystal. A semiclassical plane-wave
model, which takes into account the electrodynamic properties of quasi-2D
planar photonic microcavity, is developed to predict the eigenfrequencies of
the confined photon modes as a function of both the hexagon-cavity size and the
film thickness. Modes with two different symmetries, triangular and hexagonal,
are critically analyzed. It is shown that the model of confined photon modes
with triangular symmetry gives a better agreement between the predicted
eigenmodes and the observed resonances.",2007-02-18T22:10:01Z
Quantum Turbulence in a Trapped Bose-Einstein Condensate,"We study quantum turbulence in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates by
numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Combining rotations around
two axes, we successfully induce quantum turbulent state in which quantized
vortices are not crystallized but tangled. The obtained spectrum of the
incompressible kinetic energy is consistent with the Kolmogorov law, the most
important statistical law in turbulence.",2007-03-23T06:18:35Z
Fluctuation theorems for stochastic dynamics,"Fluctuation theorems make use of time reversal to make predictions about
entropy production in many-body systems far from thermal equilibrium. Here we
review the wide variety of distinct, but interconnected, relations that have
been derived and investigated theoretically and experimentally. Significantly,
we demonstrate, in the context of Markovian stochastic dynamics, how these
different fluctuation theorems arise from a simple fundamental time-reversal
symmetry of a certain class of observables. Appealing to the notion of Gibbs
entropy allows for a microscopic definition of entropy production in terms of
these observables. We work with the master equation approach, which leads to a
mathematically straightforward proof and provides direct insight into the
probabilistic meaning of the quantities involved. Finally, we point to some
experiments that elucidate the practical significance of fluctuation relations.",2007-02-23T16:02:00Z
"A robust lower limit on the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the
  universe from cluster abundance and weak lensing","Cluster abundance measurements are among the most sensitive probes of the
amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe, which in turn can help
constrain other cosmological parameters, like the dark energy equation of state
or neutrino mass. However, difficulties in calibrating the relation between the
cluster observable and halo mass, and the lack of completeness information,
make this technique particularly susceptible to systematic errors. Here we
argue that a cluster abundance analysis using statistical weak lensing on the
stacked clusters leads to a robust lower limit on the amplitude of
fluctuations. The method compares the average weak lensing signal measured
around the whole cluster sample to a theoretical prediction, assuming that the
clusters occupy the centers of all of the most massive halos above some minimum
mass threshold. If the amplitude of fluctuations is below a certain limiting
value, there are too few massive clusters in this model and the theoretical
prediction falls below the observations. Since any effects that modify the
model assumptions can only decrease the theoretical prediction, the limiting
amplitude becomes a robust lower limit. Here, we apply it to a volume limited
sample of 16,000 group/cluster candidates identified from isolated luminous red
galaxies (LRGs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find $\sigma_8
(\Omega_m/0.25)^{0.5}>0.62$ at the 95% c.l. after taking into account
observational errors in the lensing analysis. While this is a relatively weak
constraint, both the scatter in the LRG luminosity-halo mass relation and the
lensing errors are large; the constraints could improve considerably in the
future with more sophisticated cluster identification algorithms and smaller
errors in the lensing analysis. [Abridged]",2007-03-06T12:48:13Z
"GRB 060505: A possible short-duration gamma-ray burst in a star forming
  region at redshift of 0.09","On 2006 May 5, a four second duration, low energy, ~10^49 erg, Gamma-Ray
Burst (GRB) was observed, spatially associated with a z=0.0894 galaxy. Here, we
report the discovery of the GRB optical afterglow and observations of its
environment using Gemini-south, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Chandra, Swift
and the Very Large Array. The optical afterglow of this GRB is spatially
associated with a prominent star forming region in the Sc-type galaxy 2dFGRS
S173Z112. Its proximity to a star forming region suggests that the progenitor
delay time, from birth to explosion, is smaller than about 10 Myr. Our HST deep
imaging rules out the presence of a supernova brighter than an absolute
magnitude of about -11 (or -12.6 in case of ``maximal'' extinction) at about
two weeks after the burst, and limits the ejected mass of radioactive Nickel 56
to be less than about 2x10^-4 solar mass (assuming no extinction). Although it
was suggested that GRB 060505 may belong to a new class of long-duration GRBs
with no supernova, we argue that the simplest interpretation is that the
physical mechanism responsible for this burst is the same as for short-duration
GRBs.",2007-03-08T21:00:03Z
Scale-free random branching tree in supercritical phase,"We study the size and the lifetime distributions of scale-free random
branching tree in which $k$ branches are generated from a node at each time
step with probability $q_k\sim k^{-\gamma}$. In particular, we focus on
finite-size trees in a supercritical phase, where the mean branching number
$C=\sum_k k q_k$ is larger than 1. The tree-size distribution $p(s)$ exhibits a
crossover behavior when $2 < \gamma < 3$; A characteristic tree size $s_c$
exists such that for $s \ll s_c$, $p(s)\sim s^{-\gamma/(\gamma-1)}$ and for $s
\gg s_c$, $p(s)\sim s^{-3/2}\exp(-s/s_c)$, where $s_c$ scales as $\sim
(C-1)^{-(\gamma-1)/(\gamma-2)}$. For $\gamma > 3$, it follows the conventional
mean-field solution, $p(s)\sim s^{-3/2}\exp(-s/s_c)$ with $s_c\sim (C-1)^{-2}$.
The lifetime distribution is also derived. It behaves as $\ell(t)\sim
t^{-(\gamma-1)/(\gamma-2)}$ for $2 < \gamma < 3$, and $\sim t^{-2}$ for $\gamma
> 3$ when branching step $t \ll t_c \sim (C-1)^{-1}$, and $\ell(t)\sim
\exp(-t/t_c)$ for all $\gamma > 2$ when $t \gg t_c$. The analytic solutions are
corroborated by numerical results.",2007-02-01T02:30:44Z
"Energy level alignment at Alq3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 interface for organic
  spintronic devices","The electronic structure of the interface between Tris
(8-hydroxyquinolino)-aluminum (Alq3) and La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 manganite (LSMO) was
investigated by means of photoelectron spectroscopy. As demonstrated recently
this interface is characterized by efficient spin injection in organic
spintronic devices. We detected a strong interface dipole of about 0.9 eV that
shifts down the whole energy diagram of the Alq3 with respect to the vacuum
level. This modifies the height of the barriers for the holes injection to 1.7
eV, indicating that hole injection from LSMO into Alq3 is more difficult than
it was expected as the energy level matched by vacuum levels. We believe the
interface dipole is due to the intrinsic dipole moment characteristic for Alq3
layer. An additional weak interaction is observed between the two materials
influencing the N 1s core levels of the organic semiconductor. The presented
data are of greatest importance for both qualitative and quantitative
description of the organic spin valves.",2007-02-14T15:18:53Z
Resumming Cosmic Perturbations,"Renormalization Group (RG) techniques have been successfully employed in
quantum field theory and statistical physics. Here we apply RG methods to study
the non-linear stages of structure formation in the Universe. Exact equations
for the power spectrum, the bispectrum, and all higher order correlation
functions can be derived for any underlying cosmological model.
  A remarkable feature of the RG flow is the emergence of an intrinsic UV
cutoff, due to dark matter velocity dispersion, which improves the convergence
of the equations at small scales. As a consequence, the method is able to
follow the non-linear evolution of the power-spectrum down to zero redshift and
to length-scales where perturbation theory fails.
  Our predictions accurately fit the results of $N$-body simulations in
reproducing the ``Baryon Acoustic Oscillations'' features of the
power-spectrum, which will be accurately measured in future galaxy surveys and
will provide a probe to distinguish among different dark energy models.",2007-03-21T16:02:44Z
Mixed-State Dissipation in Zero Temperature Limit in $MgB_2$ Thin Films,"We have studied mixed-state dissipation in epitaxial MgB$_2$ thin films by
measurements of resistive transition, current-voltage characteristics, Hall
effect, and point-contact tunnelling spectrum. We found that unlike single gap
superconductors with negligible vortex quantum fluctuations in which vortices
are frozen at T=0 K, finite zero-temperature dissipation due to vortex motion
exists in MgB$_2$ over a wide magnetic field range. This dissipation was found
to be associated with proliferation of quasiparticles from the $\pi$-band of
MgB$_2$. The result shows that the vortex fluctuations are enhanced by two-band
superconductivity in MgB$_2$ and we suggest that the vortex quantum fluctuation
is a possible cause of the non-vanishing zero-temperature dissipation.",2007-03-24T03:40:29Z
"Kinematics of gas and stars in the circumnuclear starforming ring of NGC
  3351","We have measured gas and stellar velocity dispersions in 5 circumnuclear
starforming regions (CNSFRs) and the nucleus of the barred spiral galaxy NGC
3351. The stellar dispersions have been obtained from high resolution spectra
of the CaT lines at $\lambda\lambda$ 8494, 8542, 8662 \AA, while the gas
velocity dispersions have been measured by Gaussian fits to the H$\beta$
$\lambda$ 4861 \AA line on high dispersion spectra.
  The CNSFRs, with sizes of about 100 to 150 pc in diameter, are seen to be
composed of several individual star clusters with sizes between 1.7 and 4.9 pc
on an HST image. Using the stellar velocity dispersions, we have derived
dynamical masses for the entire starforming complexes and for the individual
star clusters. Values of the stellar velocity dispersions are between 39 and 67
km s$^{-1}$. Dynamical masses for the whole CNSFRs are between 4.9 $\times$
10$^6$ and 4.3 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ and between 1.8 and 8.7 $\times$
10$^6$ M$_\odot$ for the individual star clusters.
  Stellar and gas velocity dispersions are found to differ by about 20 km
s$^{-1}$ with the H$\beta$ lines being narrower than both the stellar lines and
the [O{\sc iii}] $\lambda$ 5007 \AA lines. We have found indications for the
presence of two different kinematical components in the ionised gas of the
regions. The radial velocity curve shows deviation from circular motions for
the ionised hydrogen consistent with its infall towards the central regions of
the galaxy at a velocity of about 25 km s$^{-1}$. To disentangle the origin of
these two components it will be necessary to map these regions with high
spectral and spatial resolution and much better S/N in particular for the
O$^{2+}$ lines.",2007-03-07T10:25:16Z
Fourier method in the determination of rotational velocities in OB stars,"We present a comprehensive study that applies the Fourier transform to a
sample of O and early B-type stars (either dwarfs, giants, or supergiants) to
determine their projected rotational velocities, compare with previous values
obtained with other methods, and seek for evidence of extra broadening in the
spectral lines
  The Fourier technique, extensively used in the study of cooler stars, has
remained only marginally applied for the case of early-type stars. The
comparison of \vsini values obtained through the \ft and \fwhm methods shows
that the \fwhm technique must be used with care in the analysis of OB giants
and supergiants, and when it is applied to \ion{He}{i} lines. Contrarily, the
\ft method appears to be a powerful tool to derive reliable projected
rotational velocities, and separate the effect of rotation from other
broadening mechanisms present in these stars.
  The analysis of the sample of OB stars shows that while dwarfs and giants
display a broad range of projected rotational velocities, from less than 30 up
to 450 \kms, supergiants have in general values close to or below 100 \kms. The
analysis has also definitely shown that while the effect of extra broadening is
negligible in OB dwarfs, it is clearly present in supergiants. When examining
the behavior of the projected rotational velocities with the stellar parameters
and across the HR diagram, we conclude, in agreement with previous researchers,
that the rotational velocity should decrease when the stars evolve. On the
contrary, macroturbulence may be constant, resulting therefore in an increasing
importance as compared to rotation when the stars evolve.",2007-03-09T19:08:02Z
Quark core formation in spinning-down pulsars,"Pulsars spin-down due to magnetic torque reducing its radius and increasing
the central energy density. Some pulsar which are born with central densities
close to the critical value of quark deconfinement may undergo a phase
transition and structural re-arrengement. This process may excite oscillation
modes and emmit gravitational waves. We determine the rate of quark core
formation in neutron stars using a realistic population synthesis code.",2007-03-19T21:00:32Z
"Electronic structure and the minimum conductance of a graphene layer on
  SiO2 from density-functional methods.","The effect of the SiO$_2$ substrate on a graphene film is investigated using
realistic but computationally convenient energy-optimized models of the
substrate supporting a layer of graphene. The electronic bands are calculated
using density-functional methods for several model substrates. This provides an
estimate of the substrate-charge effects on the behaviour of the bands near
$E_F$, as well as a variation of the equilibrium distance of the graphene
sheet. A model of a wavy graphene layer is examined as a possible candidate for
understanding the nature of the minimally conducting states in graphene.",2007-03-03T18:55:43Z
Stokes diagnostics of simulated solar magneto-convection,"We present results of synthetic spectro-polarimetric diagnostics of radiative
MHD simulations of solar surface convection with magnetic fields. Stokes
profiles of Zeeman-sensitive lines of neutral iron in the visible and infrared
spectral ranges emerging from the simulated atmosphere have been calculated in
order to study their relation to the relevant physical quantities and compare
with observational results. We have analyzed the dependence of the Stokes-I
line strength and width as well as of the Stokes-V signal and asymmetries on
the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we have evaluated the correspondence
between the actual velocities in the simulation with values determined from the
Stokes-I (Doppler shift of the centre of gravity) and Stokes-V profiles
(zero-crossing shift). We confirm that the line weakening in strong magnetic
fields results from a higher temperature (at equal optical depth) in the
magnetic flux concentrations. We also confirm that considerable Stokes-V
asymmetries originate in the peripheral parts of strong magnetic flux
concentrations, where the line of sight cuts through the magnetopause of the
expanding flux concentration into the surrounding convective donwflow.",2007-03-19T15:54:42Z
"Comparison of chain versus sheet crystal structures for cyanides $M$CN
  ($M$ = Cu-Au) and dicarbides $M$C$_2$ ($M$ = Be-Ba; Zn-Hg). Alternatives to
  graphene ?","The cyanides $M$CN, $M$=Cu, Ag, Au, have experimentally a structure with
hexagonally packed, infinite -$M$-CN-$M$-CN- chains. Following our earlier
study for AuCN, we now predict that all three $M$CN could have an alternative
$M_3$C$_3$N$_3$ sheet structure of comparable energy with the known one. The
valence isoelectronic systems $M$C$_2$ versus $M_3$C$_6$, $M$=Be-Ba; Zn-Hg are
also studied. Now, the known dicarbides have the CaC$_2$ or MgC$_2$ chain
structures. The predicted sheets lie energetically below the chains for $M$ =
Zn, Cd, and Hg. All these systems are experimentally unknown. Indeed, they are
clearly endothermic, compared to the elements. For some sheet structures the
densities of states suggests rather small band gaps and even metallic
character. When available, the experimental geometries agree well with the
calculated ones for both cyanides and dicarbides.",2007-01-26T18:48:45Z
"DFT investigation of 3d transition metal NMR shielding tensors in
  diamagnetic systems using the gauge-including projector augmented-wave method","We present a density functional theory based method for calculating NMR
shielding tensors for 3d transition metal nuclei using periodic boundary
conditions. Calculations employ the gauge-including projector augmented-wave
pseudopotentials method. The effects of ultrasoft pseudopotential and induced
approximations on the second-order magnetic response are intensively examined.
The reliability and the strength of the approach for 49Ti and 51V nuclei is
shown by comparison with traditional quantum chemical methods, using benchmarks
of finite organometallic systems. Application to infinite systems is validated
through comparison to experimental data for the 51V nucleus in various vanadium
oxide based compounds. The successful agreement obtained for isotropic chemical
shifts contrasts with full estimation of the shielding tensor eigenvalues,
revealing the limitation of pure exchange-correlation functionals compared to
their exact-exchange corrected analogues.",2007-03-21T15:24:14Z
Bond Stiffening in Nanoclusters and its Consequences,"We have used density functional perturbation theory to investigate the
stiffness of interatomic bonds in small clusters of Si, Sn and Pb. As the
number of atoms in a cluster is decreased, there is a marked shortening and
stiffening of bonds. The competing factors of fewer but stiffer bonds in
clusters result in softer elastic moduli but higher (average) frequencies as
size is decreased, with clear signatures of universal scaling relationships. A
significant role in understanding trends is played by the coordination number
of the bulk structure: the higher this is, the lesser is the relative softening
of elastic constants, and the greater the relative damping of vibrational
amplitudes, for clusters compared to the bulk. Our results could provide a
framework for understanding recent reports that some clusters remain solid
above the bulk melting temperature.",2007-02-28T12:17:23Z
Electronic structure of spheroidal fullerenes,"Graphite is an example of a layered material that can be bent to form
fullerenes which promise important applications in electronic nanodevices. The
spheroidal geometry of a slightly elliptically deformed sphere was used as a
possible approach to fullerenes. We assumed that for a small deformation the
eccentricity of the spheroid is much more smaller then one. We are interested
in the elliptically deformed fullerenes C70 as well as in C60 and its spherical
generalizations like big C240 and C540 molecules. In the next study the
expanded field-theory model was proposed to study the electronic states near
the Fermi energy in spheroidal fullerenes. The low energy electronic wave
functions obey a two-dimensional Dirac equation on a spheroid with two kinds of
gauge fluxes taken into account. We shown exactly how a small deformation of
spherical fullerenes provokes an appearance of fine structure in the electronic
energy spectrum as compared to the spherical case. The effect of a weak uniform
magnetic field on the electronic structure of slightly deformed fullerene
molecules was also studied. We shown that the fine structure of the electronic
energy spectrum is very sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field. We
found that the magnetic field pointed in the x direction does not influence the
first electronic level whereas it causes a splitting of the second energy
level.",2007-03-22T13:13:40Z
"Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals studied by the
  multi d-orbital tight-binding model","To elucidate the origin of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnetic
transition metals, we study the intrinsic AHE based on a multi-orbital
(xz,yz)-tight-binding model. We find that a large anomalous velocity comes from
the off-diagonal (inter-orbital) hopping. By this reason, the present model
shows a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) which is compatible
with typical experimental values in ferromagnets [100-1000 [1/\Omega cm]],
without necessity to assume a special band structure at the Fermi level. In
good metals where resistivity \rho is small, the intrinsic AHC is constant
(dissipation-less) as found by Karplus and Luttinger. In bad metals, however,
we find that the AHC is proportional to \rho^{-2} when \hbar/2\tau is larger
than the minimum band-splitting measured from the Fermi level. This crossover
behavior of the intrinsic AHE, which was first derived in J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 63
(1994) 2627, is recently observed in various ferromagnetic metals universally
by A. Asamitsu et al. We also stress that the present (xz,yz)-tight binding
model shows a huge spin Hall effect in a paramagnetic state.",2007-01-29T04:27:41Z
"Simultaneous photon absorption as a probe of molecular interaction and
  hydrogen-bond correlation in liquids","We have investigated the simultaneous absorption of near-infrared photons by
pairs of neighboring molecules in liquid methanol. Simultaneous absorption by
two OH-stretching modes is found to occur at an energy higher than the sum of
the two absorbing modes. This frequency shift arises from interaction between
the modes, and its value has been used to determine the average coupling
between neighboring methanol molecules. We find a rms coupling strength of
46+/-1 cm-1, much larger than can be explained from transition-dipole coupling,
suggesting that hydrogen-bond mediated interactions between neighboring
molecules play an important role in liquid methanol. The most important aspect
of simultaneous vibrational absorption is that it allows for a quantitative
investigation of hydrogen-bond cooperativity. We derive the extent to which the
hydrogen-bond strengths of neighboring molecules are correlated by comparing
the line shape of the absorption band caused by simultaneous absorption with
that of the fundamental transition. Surprisingly, neighboring hydrogen bonds in
methanol are found to be strongly correlated, and from the data we obtain a
hydrogen-bond correlation coefficient of 0.69+/-0.12.",2007-03-06T15:53:03Z
Metastable tight knots in a worm-like polymer,"Based on an estimate of the knot entropy of a worm-like chain we predict that
the interplay of bending energy and confinement entropy will result in a
compact metastable configuration of the knot that will diffuse, without
spreading, along the contour of the semi-flexible polymer until it reaches one
of the chain ends. Our estimate of the size of the knot as a function of its
topological invariant (ideal aspect ratio) agrees with recent experimental
results of knotted dsDNA. Further experimental tests of our ideas are proposed.",2007-02-07T00:00:23Z
"Two-phase coexistence is tunable and is not the equilibrium state in
  half-doped manganites","We discuss our very interesting experimental observation that the
low-temperature two-phase coexistence in half-doped manganites is multi-valued
(at any field) in that we can tune the coexisting
antiferromagnetic-insulating(AF-I) and the ferromagnetic-metallic(FM-M)
phase-fractions by following different paths in (H,T) space. We have shown
experimentally that the phase-fraction, in this two-phase coexistence, can take
continuous infinity of values. All but one of these are metastable, and
two-phase coexistence is not an equilibrium state.",2007-03-06T05:24:26Z
"Quantum spin nematics, dimerization, and deconfined criticality in
  quasi-one dimensional spin-1 magnets","We study theoretically the destruction of spin nematic order due to quantum
fluctuations in quasi-one dimensional spin-1 magnets. If the nematic ordering
is disordered by condensing disclinations then quantum Berry phase effects
induce dimerization in the resulting paramagnet. We develop a theory for a
Landau-forbidden second order transition between the spin nematic and dimerized
states found in recent numerical calculations. Numerical tests of the theory
are suggested.",2007-01-16T04:04:57Z
Density of near-extreme events,"We provide a quantitative analysis of the phenomenon of crowding of
near-extreme events by computing exactly the density of states (DOS) near the
maximum of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables.
We show that the mean DOS converges to three different limiting forms depending
on whether the tail of the distribution of the random variables decays slower
than, faster than, or as a pure exponential function. We argue that some of
these results would remain valid even for certain {\em correlated} cases and
verify it for power-law correlated stationary Gaussian sequences. Satisfactory
agreement is found between the near-maximum crowding in the summer temperature
reconstruction data of western Siberia and the theoretical prediction.",2007-01-16T13:33:05Z
Assessing the Value of Coooperation in Wikipedia,"Since its inception six years ago, the online encyclopedia Wikipedia has
accumulated 6.40 million articles and 250 million edits, contributed in a
predominantly undirected and haphazard fashion by 5.77 million unvetted
volunteers. Despite the apparent lack of order, the 50 million edits by 4.8
million contributors to the 1.5 million articles in the English-language
Wikipedia follow strong certain overall regularities. We show that the
accretion of edits to an article is described by a simple stochastic mechanism,
resulting in a heavy tail of highly visible articles with a large number of
edits. We also demonstrate a crucial correlation between article quality and
number of edits, which validates Wikipedia as a successful collaborative
effort.",2007-02-23T17:59:06Z
"Nanoscale Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for Molecules and Mesoscopic
  Devices in the Strong-Correlation Regime","We develop a nanoscale dynamical mean-field theory (nano-DMFT) to deal with
strong Coulomb interaction effects in physical systems that are intermediate in
size between atoms and bulk materials, taking into account the tunneling into
nearby electrodes. Focusing on a simplified treelike geometry, the usual DMFT
loop simply stops when the finite lattice is fully covered, starting with an
initial seed provided by the electronic environment at the boundary. To
illustrate this nano-DMFT, we investigate the disappearance of the
quasiparticle weight in a correlated nano object near the Mott transition. In
contrast to thermally driven classical phase transitions, quantum effects lead
to unexpected oscillations of the order parameter, related to the interference
of coherent renormalized quasiparticles. This behavior also implies a spatially
inhomogeneous Mott localization process at the nanoscale.",2007-01-29T21:00:08Z
"A signature of quantum gravity at the source of the seeds of cosmic
  structure?","This article reviews a recent work by a couple of colleagues and myself about
the shortcomings of the standard explanations of the quantum origin of cosmic
structure in the inflationary scenario, and a proposal to address them. The
point it that in the usual accounts the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of our
universe seem to emerge from an exactly homogeneous and isotropic initial state
through processes that do not break those symmetries. We argued that some novel
aspect of physics must be called upon to able to address the problem in a fully
satisfactory way. The proposed approach is inspired on Penrose's ideas
regarding an quantum gravity induced, real and dynamical collapse of the wave
function.",2007-01-13T00:28:21Z
Quantum fluctuation-induced uniaxial and biaxial spin nematics,"It is shown that zero point quantum fluctuations (ZPQFs) completely lift the
accidental continuous degeneracy that is found in mean field analysis of
quantum spin nematic phases of hyperfine spin 2 cold atoms. The result is two
distinct ground states which have higher symmetries: a uniaxial spin nematic
and a biaxial spin nematic with dihedral symmetry ${Dih}_4$. There is a novel
first order quantum phase transition between the two phases as atomic
scattering lengths are varied. We find that the ground state of $^{87}Rb$ atoms
should be a uniaxial spin nematic. We note that the energy barrier between the
phases could be observable in dynamical experiments.",2007-02-02T19:36:58Z
On the evolution of tachyonic perturbations at super-Hubble scales,"In the slow-roll inflationary scenario, the amplitude of the curvature
perturbations approaches a constant value soon after the modes leave the Hubble
radius. However, relatively recently, it was shown that the amplitude of the
curvature perturbations induced by the canonical scalar field can grow at
super-Hubble scales if there is either a transition to fast roll inflation or
if inflation is interrupted for some period of time. In this work, we extend
the earlier analysis to the case of a non-canonical scalar field described by
the Dirac-Born-Infeld action. With the help of a specific example, we show that
the amplitude of the tachyonic perturbations can be enhanced or suppressed at
super-Hubble scales if there is a transition from slow roll to fast roll
inflation. We also illustrate as to how the growth of the entropy perturbations
during the fast roll regime proves to be responsible for the change in the
amplitude of the curvature perturbations at super-Hubble scales. Furthermore,
following the earlier analysis for the canonical scalar field, we show that the
power spectrum evaluated in the long wavelength approximation matches the exact
power spectrum obtained numerically very well. Finally, we briefly comment on
an application of this phenomenon.",2007-03-29T14:34:12Z
Efficient First-Order Temporal Logic for Infinite-State Systems,"In this paper we consider the specification and verification of
infinite-state systems using temporal logic. In particular, we describe
parameterised systems using a new variety of first-order temporal logic that is
both powerful enough for this form of specification and tractable enough for
practical deductive verification. Importantly, the power of the temporal
language allows us to describe (and verify) asynchronous systems, communication
delays and more complex properties such as liveness and fairness properties.
These aspects appear difficult for many other approaches to infinite-state
verification.",2007-02-06T15:10:51Z
"GMRT and VLA observations at 49cm and 20cm of the HII region near
  l=24.4d, b=0.1d","We report multifrequency radio continuum and hydrogen radio recombination
line observations of HII regions near l=24.8d b=0.1d using the Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 1.28 GHz (n=172), 0.61 GHz (n=220) and the Very Large
Array (VLA) at 1.42 GHz (n=166). The region consists of a large number of
resolved HII regions and a few compact HII regions as seen in our continuum
maps, many of which have associated infrared (IR) point sources. The largest
HII region at l=24.83d and b=0.1d is a few arcmins in size and has a shell-type
morphology. It is a massive HII region enclosing ~ 550 solar mass with a linear
size of 7 pc and an rms electron density of ~ 110 cm^-3 at a kinematic distance
of 6 kpc. The required ionization can be provided by a single star of spectral
type O5.5.
  We also report detection of hydrogen recombination lines from the HII region
at l=24.83d and b=0.1d at all observed frequencies near Vlsr=100 km/s. We model
the observed integrated line flux density as arising in the diffuse HII region
and find that the best fitting model has an electron density comparable to that
derived from the continuum. We also report detection of hydrogen recombination
lines from two other HII regions in the field.",2007-03-09T09:55:40Z
"BKT-like transition in the Potts model on an inhomogeneous annealed
  network","We solve the ferromagnetic q-state Potts model on an inhomogeneous annealed
network which mimics a random recursive graph. We find that this system has the
inverted Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) phase transition for any $q
\geq 1$, including the values $q \geq 3$, where the Potts model normally shows
a first order phase transition. We obtain the temperature dependences of the
order parameter, specific heat, and susceptibility demonstrating features
typical for the BKT transition. We show that in the entire normal phase, both
the distribution of a linear response to an applied local field and the
distribution of spin-spin correlations have a critical, i.e. power-law, form.",2007-01-08T22:34:07Z
A slow-to-start traffic model related to a M/M/1 queue,"We consider a system of ordered cars moving in $\R$ from right to left.
  Each car is represented by a point in $\R$; two or more cars can occupy the
same point but cannot overpass. Cars have two possible velocities: either 0 or
1. An unblocked car needs an exponential random time of mean 1 to pass from
speed 0 to speed 1 (\emph{slow-to-start}). Car $i$, say, travels at speed 1
until it (possibly) hits the stopped car $i-1$ to its left. After the departure
of car $i-1$, car $i$ waits an exponential random time to change its speed to
1, travels at this speed until it hits again stopped car $i-1$ and so on.
Initially cars are distributed in $\R$ according to a Poisson process of
parameter $\lambda<1$. We show that every car will be stopped only a finite
number of times and that the final relative car positions is again a Poisson
process with parameter $\lambda$. To do that, we relate the trajectories of the
cars to a $M/M/1$ stationary queue as follows. Space in the traffic model is
time for the queue. The initial positions of the cars coincide with the arrival
process of the queue and the final relative car positions match the departure
process of the queue.",2007-03-27T11:55:19Z

"Pairing Gaps, Pseudogaps, and Phase Diagrams for Cuprate Superconductors","We use a symmetry-constrained variational procedure to construct a
generalization of BCS to include Cooper pairs with non-zero momentum and
angular momentum. The resulting gap equations are solved at zero and finite
temperature, and the doping-dependent solutions are used to construct gap and
phase diagrams. We find a pseudogap terminating at a critical doping that may
be interpreted in terms of both competing order and preformed pairs. The strong
similarity between observation and predicted gap and phase structure suggests
that this approach may provide a unified description of the complex structure
observed for cuprate superconductors.",2007-02-21T16:16:35Z
Spectral Function and Kinetic Equation for Normal Fermi Liquid,"On the basis of the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) varient of the time dependent Green's
function method a new ansatz for the approximation of a spectral function is
offered. The ansatz possesses all the advantages of quasiparticle (QP) and
extended quasiparticle (EQP) approximations and satisfies the KB equation for a
spectral function in the case of slightly nonequilibrium system when
disturbances in space and time are taken into consideration in the gradient
approximation. This feature opens new opportunities for the microscopic
derivation of the Landau kinetic equation for the quasiparticle distribution
function of the normal fermi liquid and provides the widening of these
equation's temperature rang of validity.",2007-01-13T06:43:00Z
"The influence of a single quantum dot state on the characteristics of a
  microdisk laser","We report a quantum dot microcavity laser with a cw sub-microwatt lasing
threshold, where a significant reduction of the lasing threshold is observed
when a single quantum dot (QD) state is aligned with a cavity mode. The quality
factor exceeds 15 000 before the system lases. When no QD states are resonant,
below threshold the cavity mode initially degrades with increasing pump power,
after which saturation occurs and then the cavity mode recovers. We associate
the initial cavity mode spoiling with QD state broadening that occurs with
increasing pump power.",2007-02-23T21:41:10Z

"A hybrid method coupling fluctuating hydrodynamics and molecular
  dynamics for the simulation of macromolecules","We present a hybrid computational method for simulating the dynamics of
macromolecules in solution which couples a mesoscale solver for the fluctuating
hydrodynamics (FH) equations with molecular dynamics to describe the
macromolecule. The two models interact through a dissipative Stokesian term
first introduced by Ahlrichs and D\""unweg [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 111}, 8225
(1999)]. We show that our method correctly captures the static and dynamical
properties of polymer chains as predicted by the Zimm model. In particular, we
show that the static conformations are best described when the ratio
$\frac{\sigma}{b}=0.6$, where $\sigma$ is the Lennard-Jones length parameter
and $b$ is the monomer bond length. We also find that the decay of the Rouse
modes' autocorrelation function is better described with an analytical
correction suggested by Ahlrichs and D\""unweg. Our FH solver permits us to
treat the fluid equation of state and transport parameters as direct simulation
parameters. The expected independence of the chain dynamics on various choices
of fluid equation of state and bulk viscosity is recovered, while excellent
agreement is found for the temperature and shear viscosity dependence of centre
of mass diffusion between simulation results and predictions of the Zimm model.
We find that Zimm model approximations start to fail when the Schmidt number
$Sc \lessapprox 30$. Finally, we investigate the importance of fluid
fluctuations and show that using the preaveraged approximation for the
hydrodynamic tensor leads to around 3% error in the diffusion coefficient for a
polymer chain when the fluid discretization size is greater than $50\AA$.",2007-03-04T21:01:59Z
"Density-functional theory study of half-metallic heterostructures:
  interstitial Mn in Si","Using density-functional theory within the generalized gradient
approximation, we show that Si-based heterostructures with 1/4 layer
$\delta$-doping of {\em interstitial} Mn (Mn$_{\mathrm int}$) are
half-metallic. For Mn$_{\mathrm int}$ concentrations of 1/2 or 1 layer, the
states induced in the band gap of $\delta$-doped heterostructures still display
high spin polarization, about 85% and 60%, respectively. The proposed
heterostructures are more stable than previously assumed $\delta$-layers of
{\em substitutional} Mn. Contrary to wide-spread belief, the present study
demonstrates that {\em interstitial} Mn can be utilized to tune the magnetic
properties of Si, and thus provides a new clue for Si-based spintronics

"Spin-Torque Ferromagnetic Resonance Measurements of Damping in
  Nanomagnets","We measure the magnetic damping parameter a in thin film CoFeB and permalloy

microwave frequency spin-transfer torque. We obtain $\alpha_{CoFeB} = 0.014 \pm
0.003$ and $\alpha_{Py}=0.010 \pm 0.002$, values comparable to measurements for
extended thin films, but significantly less than the effective damping
determined previously for similar nanomagnets by fits to time-domain studies of
large-angle magnetic excitations and magnetic reversal. The greater damping
found for the large amplitude nanomagnet dynamics is attributed to the

Diffusion in Modulated Media,"We study the motion of Brownian particle in modulated media in the strong

from localise to diffusive behavior. By using model potential we have seen the
localised behavior when the number of minima of the potential is finite in the
asymptotic time limit. In the limit of infinite number of minima we have seen

"Exact solution of the mixed-spin Ising model on a decorated square
  lattice with two different kinds of decorating spins on horizontal and
  vertical bonds","The mixed spin-(1/2, S_B, S_C) Ising model on a decorated square lattice with
two different kinds of decorating spins S_B and S_C placed on its horizontal
and vertical bonds, respectively, is exactly solved by establishing a precise
mapping relationship with the corresponding spin-1/2 Ising model on an
anisotropic square (rectangular) lattice. The effect of uniaxial single-ion
anisotropy acting on both types of decorating spins S_B and S_C is examined in
particular. If decorating spins S_B and S_C are integer and half-odd-integer,
respectively, or if the reverse is the case, the model under investigation
displays a very peculiar critical behavior beared on the spontaneously ordered
'quasi-1D' spin system, which appears as a result of the single-ion anisotropy
strengthening. We have found convincing evidence that this remarkable
spontaneous ordering virtually arises even though all integer-valued decorating
spins tend towards their 'non-magnetic' spin state S=0 and the system becomes
disordered only upon further increase of the single-ion anisotropy. The
single-ion anisotropy parameter is also at an origin of various temperature

"Comment on ""Prediction of lattice constant in cubic perovskites""","In a recent work by Jiang et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Solids 67 (2006) 1531-1536],
the interrelationship between lattice constant, ionic radii and tolerance
factor of cubic perovskites has been established and an empirical equation was
obtained. However, the assumption of incorrect ionic coordination led to an
incorrect mathematical expression even though the average relative errors
between predicted and observed lattice constants of 132 materials were below
1%. Here, corrected coefficients for that empirical expression are obtained,
which would likely be useful for investigation of general perovskite materials.",2007-03-16T21:46:13Z
"Non-left-handed transmission and bianisotropic effect in a [pi]-shaped
  metallic metamaterials","A [pi]-shaped metallic metamaterial (geometrically, a combination medium of
C-shaped resonators and continuous wires) is proposed to numerically
investigate its transmission band near the resonant frequency, where otherwise
it should be a negative-permeability (or negative-permittivity) stop band if
either the C-shaped or continuous-wire constituent is separately considered.
However, in contrast to the left-handed materials (LHMs)composed of split-ring
resonators and wires as well as other metallic LHMs, this resonant transmission
is a non-left-handed one as a result of the intrinsic bianisotropic effect
attributed to the electrically asymmetric configuration of this [pi]-shaped
metamaterial.",2007-02-23T13:40:43Z
Correlation effects in the transport through quantum dots,"We study the charge and heat transport through the correlated quantum dot
with a finite value of the charging energy U \neq \infty . The Kondo resonance
appearing at temperatures below T_K is responsible for several qualitative
changes of the electric and thermal transport. We show that under such
conditions the semiclassical Mott relation between the thermopower and electric
conductivity is violated. We also analyze the other transport properties where
a finite charging energy U has a significant influence. They are considered
here both, in the limit of small and for arbitrarily large values of the
external voltage eV and/or temperature difference. In particular, we check
validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law and the semiclassical Mott relation.",2007-01-10T17:52:47Z
Charge-stripe order in the electronic ferroelectric LuFe2O4,"The structural features of the charge ordering states in LuFe2O4 are
characterized by in-situ cooling TEM observations from 300K down to 20K. Two
distinctive structural modulations, a major q1= (1/3, 1/3, 2) and a weak
q2=q1/10 + (0, 0, 3/2), have been well determined at the temperature of 20K.
Systematic analysis demonstrates that the charges at low temperatures are well
crystallized in a charge stripe phase, in which the charge density wave
behaviors in a non-sinusoidal fashion resulting in elemental electric dipoles
for ferroelectricity. It is also noted that the charge ordering and
ferroelectric domains often change markedly with lowering temperatures and
yields a rich variety of structural phenomena.",2007-02-26T09:23:39Z
Orthogonal Codes for Robust Low-Cost Communication,"Orthogonal coding schemes, known to asymptotically achieve the capacity per
unit cost (CPUC) for single-user ergodic memoryless channels with a zero-cost
input symbol, are investigated for single-user compound memoryless channels,
which exhibit uncertainties in their input-output statistical relationships. A
minimax formulation is adopted to attain robustness. First, a class of
achievable rates per unit cost (ARPUC) is derived, and its utility is
demonstrated through several representative case studies. Second, when the
uncertainty set of channel transition statistics satisfies a convexity
property, optimization is performed over the class of ARPUC through utilizing
results of minimax robustness. The resulting CPUC lower bound indicates the
ultimate performance of the orthogonal coding scheme, and coincides with the
CPUC under certain restrictive conditions. Finally, still under the convexity
property, it is shown that the CPUC can generally be achieved, through
utilizing a so-called mixed strategy in which an orthogonal code contains an
appropriate composition of different nonzero-cost input symbols.",2007-02-19T19:06:56Z
Vertex corrections in localized and extended systems,"Within many-body perturbation theory we apply vertex corrections to various
closed-shell atoms and to jellium, using a local approximation for the vertex
consistent with starting the many-body perturbation theory from a DFT-LDA
Green's function. The vertex appears in two places -- in the screened Coulomb
interaction, W, and in the self-energy, \Sigma -- and we obtain a systematic
discrimination of these two effects by turning the vertex in \Sigma on and off.
We also make comparisons to standard GW results within the usual random-phase
approximation (RPA), which omits the vertex from both. When a vertex is
included for closed-shell atoms, both ground-state and excited-state properties
demonstrate only limited improvements over standard GW. For jellium we observe
marked improvement in the quasiparticle band width when the vertex is included
only in W, whereas turning on the vertex in \Sigma leads to an unphysical
quasiparticle dispersion and work function. A simple analysis suggests why
implementation of the vertex only in W is a valid way to improve quasiparticle
energy calculations, while the vertex in \Sigma is unphysical, and points the
way to development of improved vertices for ab initio electronic structure
calculations.",2007-02-13T10:25:36Z
"Weak coupling d-wave BCS superconductivity and unpaired electrons in
  overdoped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} single crystals","The low-temperature specific heat (SH) of overdoped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}
single crystals (0.178=<x=<0.290) has been measured. For the superconducting
samples (0.178=<x=<0.238), the derived gap values (without any adjusting
parameters) approach closely onto the theoretical prediction
\Delta_{0}=2.14k_{B}T_{c} for the weak-coupling d-wave BCS superconductivity.
In addition, the residual term \gamma(0) of SH at H=0 increases with x
dramatically when beyond x~0.22, and finally evolves into the value of a
complete normal metallic state at higher doping levels, indicating growing
amount of unpaired electrons. We argue that this large \gamma(0) cannot be
simply attributed to the pair breaking induced by the impurity scattering,
instead the phase separation is possible.",2007-03-18T02:49:27Z
New ID Based Multi-Proxy Multi-Signcryption Scheme from Pairings,"This paper presents an identity based multi-proxy multi-signcryption scheme

proxy agent by the coopration of all members in the original signcryption
group. Then the proxy signcryption can be generated by the cooperation of all
the signcrypters in the authorized proxy signcrypter group on the behalf of the

"Investigation of the chemical vicinity of crystal defects in
  ion-irradiated Mg and AZ31 with coincident Doppler broadening spectroscopy","Crystal defects in magnesium and magnesium based alloys like AZ31 are of
major importance for the understanding of their macroscopic properties. We have
investigated defects and their chemical surrounding in Mg and AZ31 on an atomic
scale with Doppler broadening spectroscopy of the positron annihilation
radiation. In these Doppler spectra the chemical information and the defect
contribution have to be thoroughly separated. For this reason samples of
annealed Mg were irradiated with Mg-ions in order to create exclusively
defects. In addition Al- and Zn-ion irradiation on Mg-samples was performed in
order to create samples with defects and impurity atoms. The ion irradiated
area on the samples was investigated with laterally and depth resolved positron
Doppler broadening spectroscopy (DBS) and compared with preceding
SRIM-simulations of the vacancy distribution, which are in excellent agreement.
The investigation of the chemical vicinity of crystal defects in AZ31 was
performed with coincident Doppler broadening spectroscopy (CDBS) by comparing
Mg-ion irradiated AZ31 with Mg-ion irradiated Mg. No formation of
solute-vacancy complexes was found due to the ion irradiation, despite the high
defect mobility.",2007-03-20T17:51:26Z
"Non-Destructive Mechanical Characterization of Sic Fibers by Raman
  Spectroscopy","The paper provides a comprehensive study on Raman spectroscopy versatility as
a fast and non destructive tool for the prediction of the mechanical properties
of SiC fibers derived from a polymeric precursor (NLM, Hi, Hi-S, SA and
Sylramic grades) or produced by CVD (SCS-6 fiber), including in situ analysis
in CMCs or MMCs. We show how the results of very simple spectra fitting are
correlated with Young's modulus, tensile strength and micro-hardness. The
reason why such a correlation exists, the common dependency of Raman signal and
mechanical behavior to the micro/nanostructure of ceramics, is discussed.",2007-01-15T16:55:16Z
Phase transitions induced by confinement of ferroic nanoparticles,"General approach for consideration of primary ferroic (ferroelectric,
ferromagnetic, ferroelastic) nanoparticles phase transitions was proposed in
phenomenological theory framework. The surface stress, order parameter
gradient, striction as well as depolarization and demagnetization effects were
included into the free energy. The strong intrinsic surface stress under the
curved nanoparticle surface was shown to play the important role in the shift
of transition temperature (if any) up to the appearance of new ordered phase
absent in the bulk ferroic. The approximate analytical expression for the
size-induced ferroelectric transition temperature dependence on cylindrical or
spherical nanoparticle sizes, polarization gradient coefficient, correlation
radius, intrinsic surface stress and electrostriction coefficient was derived.
It was shown that the transition temperature of nanoparticle could be higher
than the one of the bulk material. The best conditions of ferroelectric
properties conservation and enhancement in nanowires correspond to the radius
5-50nm and compressive surface stress. Under the favorable conditions size
effects (spatial confinement) induces ferroelectric phase in incipient
ferroelectrics nanowires and nanospheres. The prediction of size-induced
ferroelectricity in KTaO3 nanorods with radius less then 5-20 nm at room
temperatures could be important for the next step of device miniaturization
based on 3D nanostructures.",2007-03-25T19:07:02Z
"Roundoff-induced attractors and reversibility in conservative
  two-dimensional maps","We numerically study two conservative two-dimensional maps, namely the baker
map (whose Lyapunov exponent is known to be positive), and a typical one
(exhibiting a vanishing Lyapunov exponent) chosen from the generalized shift
family of maps introduced by C. Moore [Phys Rev Lett {\bf 64}, 2354 (1990)] in
the context of undecidability. We calculated the time evolution of the entropy
$S_q \equiv \frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^Wp_i^q}{q-1}$ ($S_1=S_{BG}\equiv
-\sum_{i=1}^Wp_i \ln p_i$), and exhibited the dramatic effect introduced by
numerical precision. Indeed, in spite of being area-preserving maps, they
present, {\it well after} the initially concentrated ensemble has spread
virtually all over the phase space, unexpected {\it pseudo-attractors}
(fixed-point like for the baker map, and more complex structures for the Moore
map). These pseudo-attractors, and the apparent time (partial) reversibility
they provoke, gradually disappear for increasingly large precision. In the case
of the Moore map, they are related to zero Lebesgue-measure effects associated
with the frontiers existing in the definition of the map. In addition to the
above, and consistently with the results by V. Latora and M. Baranger [Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 82}, 520 (1999)], we find that the rate of the
far-from-equilibrium entropy production of baker map, numerically coincides
with the standard Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of this strongly chaotic system.",2007-02-23T20:40:42Z
"Quantum Mechanical Treatment of the Problem of Constraints in
  Nonextensive Formalism Revisited","The purity of Werner state in nonextensive formalism associated with two
different constraints has been calculated in a previous paper by G. B. Bagci et
al. [G. B. Bagci et al., Int. J. Mod. Phys. 20, 2085 (2006)]. Two different
results have been obtained corresponding to ordinary probability and escort
probability whereas the former has been shown to result in negative values
thereby leading authors to deduce the advantage of escort probabilities over
ordinary probabilities. However, this results have been only for a limited
interval of q values which lie between 0 and 1. In this paper, we solve the
same problem for all values of nonextensive index q by using a perturbative
approach and show that the simultaneous use of both types of constraint is
necessary in order to obtain the solution for whole spectrum of nonextensive
index. In this sense, the existence of these different constraints in
nonextensive formalism must not be seen as a deficiency in the formalism but
rather must be welcomed as a means of providing solution for all values of
parameter q.",2007-01-30T12:17:53Z
Nonlinear response theories and effective pair potentials,"We present a general method based on nonlinear response theory to obtain
effective interactions between ions in an electron gas which can also be
applied to other systems where an adiabatic separation of time-scales is
possible. Nonlinear contributions to the interatomic potential are expressed in
terms of physically meaningful quantities, giving insight in the physical
properties of the system. The method is applied to various test cases and is
found to improve the standard linear and quadratic response approaches. It also
reduces the discrepancies previously observed between perturbation theory and
density-functional theory results for the proton-proton pair potentials in
metallic environments.",2007-03-06T00:50:36Z
"Polarization Screening Effect on Local Polarization Switching Mechanism
  and Hysteresis Loop Measurements in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy","Piezoresponse Force Spectroscopy (PFS) has emerged as a powerful tool for
probing polarization dynamics on the nanoscale. Application of a dc bias to a
nanoscale probe in contact with a ferroelectric surface results in the
nucleation and growth of a ferroelectric domain below the probe apex. The
latter affects local electromechanical response detected by the probe.
Resulting hysteresis loop contains information on local ferroelectric
switching. The self-consistent analysis of the PFS data requires (a) deriving
the thermodynamic parameters of domain nucleation and (b) establishing the
relationships between domain parameters and PFM signal. Here, we analyze the
effect of screening at the domain wall on local polarization reversal
mechanism. It is shown that the screening control both the domain nucleation
activation energy and hysteresis loop saturation rate.",2007-02-08T17:25:48Z
Stationary states in Langevin dynamics under asymmetric Lévy noises,"Properties of systems driven by white non-Gaussian noises can be very
different from these systems driven by the white Gaussian noise. We investigate
stationary probability densities for systems driven by $\alpha$-stable L\'evy
type noises, which provide natural extension to the Gaussian noise having
however a new property mainly a possibility of being asymmetric. Stationary
probability densities are examined for a particle moving in parabolic, quartic
and in generic double well potential models subjected to the action of
$\alpha$-stable noises. Relevant solutions are constructed by methods of
stochastic dynamics. In situations where analytical results are known they are
compared with numerical results. Furthermore, the problem of estimation of the
parameters of stationary densities is investigated.",2007-02-07T17:15:10Z
Contact lines for fluid surface adhesion,"When a fluid surface adheres to a substrate, the location of the contact line
adjusts in order to minimize the overall energy. This adhesion balance implies
boundary conditions which depend on the characteristic surface deformation
energies. We develop a general geometrical framework within which these
conditions can be systematically derived. We treat both adhesion to a rigid
substrate as well as adhesion between two fluid surfaces, and illustrate our
general results for several important Hamiltonians involving both curvature and
curvature gradients. Some of these have previously been studied using very
different techniques, others are to our knowledge new. What becomes clear in
our approach is that, except for capillary phenomena, these boundary conditions
are not the manifestation of a local force balance, even if the concept of
surface stress is properly generalized. Hamiltonians containing higher order
surface derivatives are not just sensitive to boundary translations but also
notice changes in slope or even curvature. Both the necessity and the
functional form of the corresponding additional contributions follow readily
from our treatment.",2007-03-01T10:02:48Z
Fermi-Bose mixture with tunable interactions,"We give an overview of recent experiments on an ultracold Fermi-Bose quantum

observation of Feshbach resonances in the K-Rb system we investigate, and their
accurate characterization. We then describe experiments in which Feshbach
resonances are exploited to study interaction effects and to associate weakly
bound KRb dimers.",2007-02-12T13:03:53Z
Optical phase shifts and diabolic topology in Mobius-type strips,"We compute the optical phase shifts between the left and the right-circularly
polarized light after it traverses non-planar cyclic paths described by the
boundary curves of closed twisted strips. The evolution of the electric field
along the curved path of a light ray is described by the Fermi-Walker transport
law which is mapped to a Schr\""{o}dinger equation. The effective quantum
Hamiltonian of the system has eigenvalues equal to $0, \pm \kappa$, where
$\kappa$ is the local curvature of the path. The inflexion points of the
twisted strips correspond to the vanishing of the curvature and manifest
themselves as the diabolic crossings of the quantum Hamiltonian. For the
M\""{o}bius loops, the critical width where the diabolic geometry resides also
corresponds to the characteristic width where the optical phase shift is
minimal. In our detailed study of various twisted strips, this intriguing
property singles out the M""{o}bius geometry.",2007-01-17T01:14:07Z
Bar-driven injection of intergalactic matter into galactic halos,"AIMS. The non-conservative gravitational potential of barred galaxies, or of
any other non-axisymmetric structure, produces a loss of energy in infalling
particles of the intergalactic medium into the galaxy, which are trapped in its
potential. This dynamical friction can contribute towards increasing the total
mass of barred galaxies.
  METHODS. Analytical calculations of the energy loss are carried out using the
orbits of the particles derived numerically. Theoretical predictions are
compared with observations through the statistical analysis of the rotation
curves of barred and non-barred galaxies, either in cluster or field galaxies.
  RESULTS. There is a net effect of accretion, but it is normally very low in
relative terms. It is only significant (>10% of the total mass of the dark
matter halo in the life of the galaxy) if the density of the intergalactic
medium is higher than ~3e13 Msun/Mpc^3 (or considerably lower in cases of
motions of the galaxies close to the IGM average motion, or perpendicular to
the plane of the galaxy, or when the halo mass is low).
  Data on rotation curves do not show clear trends towards higher halo mass for
barred galaxies, only slight trends for early-type spiral galaxies. In any
case, the statistical uncertainties are limited to the detection of differences
in masses >~20%, so the effect of bar-driven injection of intergalactic matter
into galactic halos might be present with relative contributions to the average
mass of these barred galaxies lower than 20%.",2007-03-15T16:13:13Z
Games on the Sperner Triangle,"We create a new two-player game on the Sperner Triangle based on Sperner's
lemma. Our game has simple rules and several desirable properties. First, the
game is always certain to have a winner. Second, like many other interesting
games such as Hex and Geography, we prove that deciding whether one can win our
game is a PSPACE-complete problem. Third, there is an elegant balance in the
game such that neither the first nor the second player always has a decisive
advantage. We provide a web-based version of the game, playable at:

"Theory of Nonequilibrium Spin Transport and Spin Transfer Torque in
  Superconducting-Ferromagnetic Nanostructures","Spin transport currents and the spin-transfer torques in voltage-biased
superconducting-ferromagnetic nanopillars (SFNFS point contacts) are computed.
We develop and implement an algorithm based on the Ricatti formulation of the
quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to solve the time-dependent boundary
conditions for the nonequilibrium Green's functions for spin transport through
the ferromagnetic interfaces. A signature of the nonequilibrium torque is a
component perpendicular to the plane spanned by the two ferromagnetic moments.
The perpendicular component is absent in normal-metal-ferromagnetic nanopillars
(NFNFN) contacts, but is shown to have the same order of magnitude as the
in-plane torque for non-equilibrium SFNFS contacts. The out-of-plane torque is
due to the rotation of quasiparticle spin by the exchange fields of the
ferromagnetic layers. In the ballistic limit the equilibrium torque is related
to the spectrum of spin-polarized Andreev bound states, while the {\sl ac}
component, for small bias voltages, is determined by the nearly adiabatic
dynamics of the Andreev bound states. The nonlinear voltage dependence of the
non-equilibrium torque, including the subharmonic gap structure and the
high-voltage asymptotics, is attributed to the interplay between multiple
Andreev reflections, spin filtering and spin mixing. These properties of spin
angular momentum transport may be exploited to control the state of
nanomagnets.",2007-02-15T20:50:22Z
Magnetothermopower in Nd1-xEuxNiO3 compounds,"We have measured magnetization M(T,H), electrical resistivity ro(T,H),
thermal conductivity k(T,H), and thermopower S(T,H) of polycrystalline samples
of Nd1-xEuxNiO3; 0 <= x <= 0.35; as a function of temperature and external
magnetic field. The data indicate a metal-insulator transition (MI) in a wide
range of temperature (200 < TMI < 325 K). The magnetic susceptibility X(T)
data, after the subtraction of the rare-earth contribution, exhibit a
Curie-Weiss like behavior at temperatures above TMI. Although a clear
antiferromagnetic AF transition of the Ni sub-lattice is observed at TN <= TMI,
X(T) still increases down to 5 K, suggesting a heterogeneous ground state. The
thermal conductivity of the NdNiO3 compound is not affected by an external
magnetic field of 90 kOe in a wide range of temperature, and its temperature
dependence below 15 K is approximately quadratic, strongly suggesting the
presence of disorder. S(T) is negative above TMI and varies linearly with
temperature. Below TMI, S(T) does not follow the expected behavior of
insulating compounds. There is a minimum close to 120 K, and S(T) changes its
sign at T ~ 30 K, indicating a competition between two types of charge
carriers. A pronounced peak in S(T) at TS ~ 20 K does not follow the expected
phonon-drag temperature dependence either above or below TS and the peak
remains unaltered under magnetic fields up to 90 kOe. However, its magnitude is
enhanced by ~ 25 % with applied magnetic field, exhibiting a clear
magnetothermopower effect. The combined results indicate a coexistence of
ordered and disordered phases below TN and that an applied magnetic field is
suitable for enhancing the thermoelectric properties close to TS.",2007-03-20T10:32:03Z
Exact Solutions of Regge-Wheeler Equation,"The Regge-Wheeler equation describes the axial perturbations of Schwarzschild

confluent Heun's functions, the basic properties of the general solution, novel
analytical approach and numerical techniques for study of different boundary
problems which correspond to quasi-normal modes of black holes and other simple
models of compact objects. We depict in more detail the exact solutions of

"Effects of diagonal disorder on Charge Density Wave and
  Superconductivity in local pair systems","We analyse the influence of diagonal disorder (random site energy) on Charge
Density Wave (CDW) and Superconductivity (SS) in local pair systems which are
described by the model of hard core charged bosons on a lattice. This problem
was previously studied within the mean field approximation for the case of half
filled band (n = 1). Here we extend that investigation to the case of arbitrary
particle concentration (0 < n < 2) and examine the phase diagrams of the model
and the behaviour of superfluid density as a function of n and the increasing
disorder. Depending on the strength of random on-site energies, the intersite
density-density repulsion and the concentration the model can exhibit several
various phases, including homogeneous phases: CDW, SS and Bose-glass (NO) as
well as the phase separated states: CDW-SS, CDW-NO and particle droplets. The
obtained results for SS phase are in qualitative agreement with the available
Monte Carlo calculations for two dimensional lattice. Also, in a definite range
of parameters the system exhibits the phenomena which we call a disorder
induced superconductivity and a disorder induced charge ordering.",2007-03-07T10:13:14Z
"A physics-based life prediction methodology for thermal barrier coating
  systems","A novel mechanistic approach is proposed for the prediction of the life of
thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems. The life prediction methodology is based
on a criterion linked directly to the dominant failure mechanism. It relies on
a statistical treatment of the TBC's morphological characteristics,
non-destructive stress measurements and on a continuum mechanics framework to
quantify the stresses that promote the nucleation and growth of microcracks
within the TBC. The last of these accounts for the effects of TBC constituents'
elasto-visco-plastic properties, the stiffening of the ceramic due to sintering
and the oxidation at the interface between the thermally insulating yttria
stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer and the metallic bond coat. The mechanistic
approach is used to investigate the effects on TBC life of the properties and
morphology of the top YSZ coating, metallic low-pressure plasma sprayed bond
coat and the thermally grown oxide. Its calibration is based on TBC damage
inferred from non-destructive fluorescence measurements using
piezo-spectroscopy and on the numerically predicted local TBC stresses
responsible for the initiation of such damage. The potential applicability of
the methodology to other types of TBC coatings and thermal loading conditions
is also discussed.",2007-03-02T16:15:58Z
"Measurement of mesoscopic High-$T_c$ superconductors using Si mechanical
  micro-oscillators","In a superconducting mesoscopic sample, with dimensions comparable to the
London penetration depth, some properties are qualitatively different to those
found in the bulk material. These properties include magnetization, vortex
dynamics and ordering of the vortex lattice. In order to detect the small
signals produced by this kind of samples, new instruments designed for the
microscale are needed. In this work we use micromechanical oscillators to study
the magnetic properties of a Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8 + \delta}$ disk with a
diameter of 13.5 microns and a thickness of 2.5 microns. The discussion of our

Collisional properties of sympathetically cooled $^{39}$K,"We report the experimental evidence of the sympathetic cooling of $^{39}$K

trap. This allowed us to perform the first direct measurement of the elastic
cross section of $^{39}$K below 50 $\mu$K. The result obtained for the triplet
scattering length, $a_T = -51(7)$ Bohr radii, agrees with previous results
derived from photoassociation spectra and from Feshbach spectroscopy of

  ZnCu_{3}(OH)_{6}Cl_{2}","ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$ ($S=1/2$) is a promising new candidate for an
ideal Kagom\'e Heisenberg antiferromagnet, because there is no magnetic phase
transition down to $\sim$50 mK. We investigated its local magnetic and lattice
environments with NMR techniques. We demonstrate that the intrinsic local spin
susceptibility {\it decreases} toward T=0, but that slow freezing of the
lattice near $\sim$50 K, presumably associated with OH bonds, contributes to a
large increase of local spin susceptibility and its distribution. Spin dynamics
near T=0 obey a power-law behavior in high magnetic fields.",2007-03-06T05:27:25Z
"Molecular model for de Vries type smectic A - smectic C phase transition
  in liquid crystals","We develop a theory of Smectic A - Smectic C phase transition with
anomalously weak smectic layer contraction. We construct a phenomenological
description of this transition by generalizing the Chen-Lubensky model. Using a
mean-field molecular model, we demonstrate that a relatively simple interaction

"Exact results on the Kitaev model on a hexagonal lattice: spin states,
  string and brane correlators, and anyonic excitations","In this work, we illustrate how a Jordan-Wigner transformation combined with
symmetry considerations enables a direct solution of Kitaev's model on the
honeycomb lattice. We (i) express the p-wave type fermionic ground states of
this system in terms of the original spins, (ii) adduce that symmetry alone
dictates the existence of string and planar brane type correlators and their
composites, (iii) compute the value of such non-local correlators by employing
the Jordan-Wigner transformation, (iv) affirm that the spectrum is
inconsequential to the existence of topological quantum order and that such
information is encoded in the states themselves, and (v) express the anyonic
character of the excitations in this system and the local symmetries that it
harbors in terms of fermions.",2007-03-24T01:36:56Z
Quantum gravity and cosmological observations,"Quantum gravity places entirely new challenges on the formulation of a
consistent theory as well as on an extraction of potentially observable
effects. Quantum corrections due to the gravitational field are commonly
expected to be tiny because of the smallness of the Planck length. However, a
consistent formulation now shows that key features of quantum gravity imply
magnification effects on correction terms which are especially important in
cosmology with its long stretches of evolution. After a review of the salient
features of recent canonical quantizations of gravity and their implications
for the quantum structure of space-time a new example for potentially
observable effects is given.",2007-01-26T19:27:17Z
A well-tempered density functional theory of electrons in molecules,"Reporting extensions of a recently developed approach to density functional
theory with correct long-range be-havior (Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 043002 (2005)).
The central quantities are a splitting functional gamma[n] and a complementary
exchange-correlation functional. We give a practical method for determining the
value of \gamma in molecules, assuming an approximation for XC energy is given.
The resulting theory shows good ability to reproduce the ionization potentials
for various molecules. However it is not of sufficient accuracy for forming a
satisfactory framework for studying molecular properties. A somewhat different
approach is then adopted, which depends on a density-independent \gamma and an
additional parameter w eliminating part of the local exchange functional. The
values of these two parameters are obtained by best-fitting to experimental
atomization energies and bond-lengths of the molecules in the G2(1) database.
The optimized values are gamma=0.5 a_0^{-1} and w=0.1 . We then examine the
performance of this slightly semi-empirical functional for a variety of
molecular properties, comparing to related works and to experiment. We show
that this approach can be used for describing in a satisfactory manner a broad
range of molecular properties, be they static or dynamic. Most satisfactory is

Statistical Cryptography using a Fisher-Schrödinger Model,"A principled procedure to infer a hierarchy of statistical distributions
possessing ill-conditioned eigenstructures, from incomplete constraints, is
presented. The inference process of the \textit{pdf}'s employs the Fisher
information as the measure of uncertainty, and, utilizes a semi-supervised
learning paradigm based on a measurement-response model. The principle
underlying the learning paradigm involves providing a quantum mechanical
connotation to statistical processes. The inferred \textit{pdf}'s constitute a
statistical host that facilitates the encryption/decryption of covert
information (code). A systematic strategy to encrypt/decrypt code via unitary
projections into the \textit{null spaces} of the ill-conditioned
eigenstructures, is presented. Numerical simulations exemplify the efficacy of
the model.",2007-01-15T07:48:41Z
An efficient PSF construction method,"Image computation is a fundamental tool for performance assessment of
astronomical instrumentation, usually implemented by Fourier transform
techniques. We review the numerical implementation, evaluating a direct
implementation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm, compared with
fast Fourier transform (FFT) tools. Simulations show that the precision is
quite comparable, but in the case investigated the computing performance is
considerably higher for DFT than FFT. The application to image simulation for
the mission Gaia and for Extremely Large Telescopes is discussed.",2007-03-05T08:49:03Z
"Four-spin-exchange- and magnetic-field-induced chiral order in two-leg
  spin ladders","We propose a mechanism of a vector chiral long-range order in two-leg
spin-1/2 and spin-1 antiferromagnetic ladders with four-spin exchanges and a
Zeeman term. It is known that for one-dimensional quantum systems, spontaneous
breakdown of continuous symmetries is generally forbidden. Any vector chiral
order hence does not appear in spin-rotationally [SU(2)]-symmetric spin
ladders. However, if a magnetic field is added along the S^z axis of ladders
and the SU(2) symmetry is reduced to the U(1) one, the z component of a vector
chiral order can emerge with the remaining U(1) symmetry unbroken. Making use
of Abelian bosonization techniques, we actually show that a certain type of
four-spin exchange can yield a vector chiral long-range order in spin-1/2 and
spin-1 ladders under a magnetic field. In the chiral-ordered phase, the Z_2
interchain-parity (i.e., chain-exchange) symmetry is spontaneously broken. We
also consider effects of perturbations breaking the parity symmetry.",2007-03-15T07:42:16Z
Gamma-Rays from Dark Matter Mini-Spikes in M31,"The existence of a population of wandering Intermediate Mass Black Holes
(IMBHs) is a generic prediction of scenarios that seek to explain the formation
of Supermassive Black Holes in terms of growth from massive seeds. The growth
of IMBHs may lead to the formation of DM overdensities called ""mini-spikes"",
recently proposed as ideal targets for indirect DM searches. Current
ground-based gamma-ray experiments, however, cannot search for these objects
due to their limited field of view, and it might be challenging to discriminate
mini-spikes in the Milky Way from the many astrophysical sources that GLAST is
expected to observe. We show here that gamma-ray experiments can effectively
search for IMBHs in the nearby Andromeda galaxy (also known as M31), where
mini-spikes would appear as a distribution of point-sources, isotropically
distributed in a \thickapprox 3^{\circ} circle around the galactic center. For
a neutralino-like DM candidate with a mass m_{\chi}=150 GeV, up to 20 sources
would be detected with GLAST (at 5\sigma, in 2 months). With Air Cherenkov
Telescopes such as MAGIC and VERITAS, up to 10 sources might be detected,
provided that the mass of neutralino is in the TeV range or above.",2007-03-29T13:23:00Z
Kapitza pendulum effect in a weakly disordered amorphous magnet,"Effect of the ""random anisotropy"" type disorder on orientation of the
magnetization in an amorphous magnet is considered. It is shown, that the
principal corrections to the free energy of the magnet originate from the
fluctuations of the order parameter in the direction of its degeneracy. The
types of disorder are found, which lift the continuous degeneracy and suppress
the Larkin-Imry-Ma mechanism of disruption of the long-range order in
continuously degenerate systems.",2007-02-25T20:28:01Z
"Ground state lost but degeneracy found: the effective thermodynamics of
  artificial spin ice","We analyze the rotational demagnetization of artificial spin ice, a recently
realized array of nanoscale single-domain ferromagnetic islands.
Demagnetization does not anneal this model system into its anti-ferromagnetic
ground state: the moments have a static disordered configuration similar to the
frozen state of the spin ice materials. We demonstrate that this athermal
system has an effective extensive degeneracy and we introduce a formalism that
can predict the populations of local states in this ice-like system with no
adjustable parameters.",2007-02-14T00:38:18Z
Flux-biased mesoscopic rings,"Kinetics of magnetic flux in a thin mesoscopic ring biased by a strong
external magnetic field is described equivalently by dynamics of a Brownian
particle in a tilted washboard potential. The 'flux velocity', i.e. the
averaged time derivative of the total magnetic flux in the ring, is a candidate
for a novel characteristics of mesoscopic rings. Its global properties reflect
the possibility of accommodating persistent currents in the ring.",2007-01-17T09:38:30Z
"Probability currents as principal characteristics in the statistical
  mechanics of non-equilibrium steady states","One of the key features of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) is the
presence of nontrivial probability currents. We propose a general
classification of NESS in which these currents play a central distinguishing
role. As a corollary, we specify the transformations of the dynamic transition
rates which leave a given NESS invariant. The formalism is most transparent
within a continuous time master equation framework since it allows for a
general graph-theoretical representation of the NESS. We discuss the
consequences of these transformations for entropy production, present several
simple examples, and explore some generalizations, to discrete time and
continuous variables.",2007-01-31T01:15:42Z
"Upper limits on the solar-neutron flux at the Yangbajing neutron monitor
  from BATSE-detected solar flares","The purpose of this work is to search the Yangbajing neutron monitor data
obtained between 1998 October and 2000 June for solar neutrons associated with
solar flares. Using the onset times of 166 BATSE-detected flares with the GOES
peak flux (1 -- 8 \AA) higher than $1.0 \times 10^{-5}$ $\mathrm{Wm^{-2}}$, we
prepare for each flare a light curve of the Yangbajing neutron monitor,
spanning $\pm$ 1.5 hours from the BATSE onset time. Based on the light curves,
a systematic search for solar neutrons in energies above 100 MeV from the 166
flares was performed. No statistically significant signals due to solar
neutrons were found in the present work. Therefore, we put upper limits on the
$>$ 100 MeV solar-neutron flux for 18 events consisting of 2 X and 16 M class
flares. The calculation assumed a power-law shaped neutron energy spectrum and
three types of neutron emission profiles at the Sun. Compared with the other
positive neutron detections associated with X-class flares, typical 95%
confidence level upper limits for the two X-class flares are found to be
comparable to the lowest and second lowest neutron fluxes at the top of the
atmosphere.In addition, the upper limits for M-class flares scatter in the
range of $10^{-2}$ to 1 neutrons $\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$. This provides the
first upper limits on the solar-neutron flux from M-class solar flares, using
space observatories as well as ground-based neutron monitors.",2007-03-16T07:06:11Z
"1/f fluctuations in spinning-particle motions around Schwarzschild black
  hole","We study the properties of chaos in the motions of a spinning test particle
in Schwarzschild spacetime. We characterize the chaos using the power spectrum
of the time series of $z$ components of the particle's position. It is found
that the pattern of the power spectrum shows not only white noise but also
$1/f$-type fluctuation, depending on the value of the total angular momentum
$J$ and the spin $S$ of the test particle. Therefore we succeed in classifying
the chaotic motions, which have been classified as simply chaotic ones in
former works, into the two distinct types. One is $1/f$, and the other is white
noise. Based on this classification, we plot, in the two-dimensional parameter
space $(J,S)$, the phase diagram for the properties of the chaos. This phase
diagram enables us in principle to guess the properties of the system $(J,S)$
by observing the dynamics of the test particle, even if the motion is chaotic.
Furthermore, we detect that the origin of the $1/f$ fluctuation is that the
particle motion stagnates around regular orbits (tori), while traveling back
and forth between them, which is called ``stagnant motion'' or ``sticky
motion'' in Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The point is that the difference of
the property of the chaos or the power spectra is due to the topological
structure of the phase space, which in turn is governed by the physical
parameter set $(J,S)$ of the system. From this point of view, the chaos we
found in this system is not always merely random.",2007-02-13T14:00:12Z
"Deformation of SU(4) singlet spin-orbital state due to Hund's rule
  coupling","We investigate the ground-state property and the excitation gap of a
one-dimensional spin-orbital model with isotropic spin and anisotropic orbital
exchange interactions, which represents the strong-coupling limit of a
two-orbital Hubbard model including the Hund's rule coupling ($J$) at quarter
filling, by using a density-matrix renormalization group method. At J=0, spin
and orbital correlations coincide with each other with a peak at $q=\pi/2$,
corresponding to the SU(4) singlet state. On the other hand, spin and orbital
states change in a different way due to the Hund's rule coupling. With
increasing $J$, the peak position of orbital correlation changes to $q=\pi$,
while that of spin correlation remains at $q=\pi/2$. In addition, orbital dimer
correlation becomes robust in comparison with spin dimer correlation,
suggesting that quantum orbital fluctuation is enhanced by the Hund's rule
coupling. Accordingly, a relatively large orbital gap opens in comparison with
a spin gap, and the system is described by an effective spin system on the
background of the orbital dimer state.",2007-01-05T07:16:18Z
Orbital fluctuations in the different phases of LaVO3 and YVO3,"We investigate the importance of quantum orbital fluctuations in the
orthorhombic and monoclinic phases of the Mott insulators LaVO3 and YVO3.
First, we construct ab-initio material-specific t2g Hubbard models. Then, by
using dynamical mean-field theory, we calculate the spectral matrix as a
function of temperature. Our Hubbard bands and Mott gaps are in very good
agreement with spectroscopy. We show that in orthorhombic LaVO3, quantum
orbital fluctuations are strong and that they are suppressed only in the
monoclinic 140 K phase. In YVO3 the suppression happens already at 300 K. We
show that Jahn-Teller and GdFeO3-type distortions are both crucial in
determining the type of orbital and magnetic order in the low temperature
phases.",2007-02-13T19:11:52Z
Slip avalanches in crystal plasticity: scaling of the avalanche cutoff,"Plastic deformation of crystals proceeds through a sequence of intermittent
slip avalanches with scale-free (power-law) size distribution. On macroscopic
scales, however, plastic flow is known to be smooth and homogeneous. In the
present letter we use a recently proposed continuum model of slip avalanches to
systematically investigate the nature of the cut-off which truncates scale-free
behavior at large avalanche sizes. The dependence of the cut-off on system
size, geometry, and driving mode, but also on intrinsic parameters such as the
strain hardening rate is established. Implications for the observability of
avalanche behavior in microscopic and macroscopic samples are discussed.",2007-01-27T17:57:43Z
"Properties and stability of freely propagating nonlinear density waves
  in accretion disks","In this paper, we study the propagation and stability of nonlinear sound
waves in accretion disks. Using the shearing box approximation, we derive the
form of these waves using a semi-analytic approach and go on to study their
stability. The results are compared to those of numerical simulations performed
using finite difference approaches such as employed by ZEUS as well as Godunov
methods. When the wave frequency is between Omega and two Omega (where Omega is
the disk orbital angular velocity), it can couple resonantly with a pair of
linear inertial waves and thus undergo a parametric instability. Neglecting the
disk vertical stratification, we derive an expression for the growth rate when
the amplitude of the background wave is small. Good agreement is found with the
results of numerical simulations performed both with finite difference and
Godunov codes. During the nonlinear phase of the instability, the flow remains
well organised if the amplitude of the background wave is small. However,
strongly nonlinear waves break down into turbulence. In both cases, the
background wave is damped and the disk eventually returns to a stationary
state. Finally, we demonstrate that the instability also develops when density
stratification is taken into account and so is robust. This destabilisation of
freely propagating nonlinear sound waves may be important for understanding the
complicated behaviour of density waves in disks that are unstable through the
effects of self-gravity or magnetic fields and is likely to affect the
propagation of waves that are tidally excited by objects such as a protoplanet
or companion perturbing a protoplanetary disk. The nonlinear wave solutions
described here as well as their stability properties were also found to be
useful for testing and comparing the performance of different numerical codes.",2007-03-13T08:16:14Z
"Quantum phase transitions and dimensional reduction in antiferromagnets
  with inter-layer frustration","For magnets with a fully frustrated inter-layer interaction, we argue that
the quantum phase transitions from a paramagnetic to an antiferromagnetic
ground state, driven by pressure or magnetic field, are asymptotically
three-dimensional, due to interaction-generated non-frustrated inter-layer
couplings. However, the relevant crossover scale is tiny, such that
two-dimensional behavior occurs in an experimentally relevant low-temperature
regime. In the pressure-driven case the phase transition may split, in which
case an Ising symmetry related to inter-layer bond order is broken before
magnetism occurs. We discuss the relation of our results to recent experiments
on BaCuSi2O6.",2007-02-07T09:53:43Z
Magnetic flux in mesoscopic rings: Quantum Smoluchowski regime,"Magnetic flux in mesoscopic rings under the quantum Smoluchowski regime is
investigated. Quantum corrections to the dissipative current are shown to form
multistable steady states and can result in statistical enhancement of the

the entropic criterion. A possible application for a qutrit architecture of
quantum information is proposed.",2007-01-05T09:16:41Z
"Detecting the dark matter via the proper motion of gamma-rays from
  microhalos","I discuss the prospects for detecting the dark matter via the proper motion
of sub-solar mass dark matter halos in the vicinity of the solar neighbourhood.
Microhalos that survive tidal disruption could exhibit proper motion of order
few arcminutes per year. For dark matter particles that couple to photons, such
as the lightest supersymmetric or Kaluza-Klein particles, microhalos could be
detected via their Gamma-ray photon emission from annihilations. A detection of
proper motion of a microhalo in the Gamma-ray part of the spectrum contains not
only information about the particle physics properties of the dark matter
particle, but also provides an insight into hierarchical structure formation at
very early times.",2007-03-29T21:54:56Z
"Dipole-induced vortex ratchets in superconducting films with arrays of
  micromagnets","We investigate the transport properties of superconducting films with
periodic arrays of in-plane magnetized micromagnets. Two different magnetic
textures are studied: a square array of magnetic bars and a close-packed array
of triangular microrings. As confirmed by MFM imaging, the magnetic state of
both systems can be adjusted to produce arrays of almost point-like magnetic
dipoles. By carrying out transport measurements with ac drive, we observed
experimentally a recently predicted ratchet effect induced by the interaction
between superconducting vortices and the magnetic dipoles. Moreover, we find
that these magnetic textures produce vortex-antivortex patterns, which have a
crucial role on the transport properties of this hybrid system.",2007-01-18T12:13:26Z
Ontology from Local Hierarchical Structure in Text,"We study the notion of hierarchy in the context of visualizing textual data
and navigating text collections. A formal framework for ``hierarchy'' is given
by an ultrametric topology. This provides us with a theoretical foundation for
concept hierarchy creation. A major objective is {\em scalable} annotation or
labeling of concept maps. Serendipitously we pursue other objectives such as
deriving common word pair (and triplet) phrases, i.e., word 2- and 3-grams. We
evaluate our approach using (i) a collection of texts, (ii) a single text
subdivided into successive parts (for which we provide an interactive
demonstrator), and (iii) a text subdivided at the sentence or line level. While
detailing a generic framework, a distinguishing feature of our work is that we
focus on {\em locality} of hierarchic structure in order to extract semantic
information.",2007-01-27T18:31:22Z
"Accurate Ritz wavelengths of parity-forbidden [Fe II], [Ti II] and [Cr
  II] infrared lines of astrophysical interest","With new astronomical infrared spectrographs the demands of accurate atomic
data in the infrared have increased. In this region there is a large amount of
parity-forbidden lines, which are of importance in diagnostics of low-density
astrophysical plasmas. We present improved, experimentally determined, energy
levels for the lowest even LS terms of Fe II, Ti II and Cr II, along with
accurate Ritz wavelengths for parity-forbidden transitions between and within
these terms. Spectra of Fe II, Ti II and Cr II have been produced in a hollow
cathode discharge lamp and acquired using high-resolution Fourier Transform
(FT) spectrometry. The energy levels have been determined by using observed
allowed ultraviolet transitions connecting the even terms with upper odd terms.
Ritz wavelengths of parity-forbidden lines have then been determined. Energy
levels of the four lowest Fe II terms (a$^{6}$D, a$^{4}$F, a$^{4}$D and
a$^{4}$P) have been determined, resulting in 97 different parity-forbidden
transitions with wavelengths between 0.74 and 87 micron. For Ti II the energy
levels of the two lowest terms (a$^{4}$F and b$^{4}$F) have been determined,
resulting in 24 different parity-forbidden transitions with wavelengths between
8.9 and 130 micron. Also for Cr II the energy levels of the two lowest terms
(a$^{6}$S and a$^{6}$D) have been determined, in this case resulting in 12
different parity-forbidden transitions with wavelengths between 0.80 and 140
micron.",2007-03-07T13:29:57Z
"Tagging, Folksonomy & Co - Renaissance of Manual Indexing?","This paper gives an overview of current trends in manual indexing on the Web.
Along with a general rise of user generated content there are more and more
tagging systems that allow users to annotate digital resources with tags
(keywords) and share their annotations with other users. Tagging is frequently
seen in contrast to traditional knowledge organization systems or as something
completely new. This paper shows that tagging should better be seen as a
popular form of manual indexing on the Web. Difference between controlled and
free indexing blurs with sufficient feedback mechanisms. A revised typology of
tagging systems is presented that includes different user roles and knowledge

detailed bibliography of current research in collaborative tagging is included.",2007-01-10T18:18:28Z
"Effect of chain length on fragility and thermodynamic scaling of the
  local segmental dynamics in poly(methylmethacrylate)","Local segmental relaxation properties of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) of
varying molecular weight are measured by dielectric spectroscopy, and analyzed
in combination the equation of state obtained from PVT measurements. The usual
variation of glass transition temperature and fragility with molecular weight
are observed. We also find, in accord with the general properties of
glass-forming materials, that a single molecular weight dependent scaling
exponent, g, is sufficient to define the mean segmental relaxation time,
tau_alpha, and its distribution. This exponent can be connected to the
Gruneisen parameter and related thermodynamic quantities, thus demonstrating
the interrelationship between dynamics and thermodynamics in PMMA. Changes in
the relaxation properties (""dynamic crossover"") are observed as a function of
both temperature and pressure, with tau_alpha serving as the control parameter
for the crossover. At longer tau_alpha another change in the dynamics is
apparent, associated with a decoupling of the local segmental process from
ionic conductivity.",2007-02-05T18:50:57Z
"Weak localization in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As nanostructures","We report on the observation of weak localization in arrays of (Ga,Mn)As

Chemical Liquid Phase Deposition of Thin Aluminum Oxide Films,"Thin aluminum oxide films were deposited by a new and simple physicochemical
method called chemical liquid phase deposition (CLD) on semiconductor
materials. Aluminum sulfate with crystallized water and sodium bicarbonate were
used as precursors for film growth, and the control of the system pH value
played an important role in this experiment. The growth rate is 12 nm/h at room
temperature. Post-growth annealing not only densifies and purifies the films,
but results in film crystallization as well. Excellent quality of Al2O3 films
in this work is supported by electron dispersion spectroscopy, Fourier

"Computation of inflationary cosmological perturbations in the power-law
  inflationary model using the phase-integral method","The phase-integral approximation devised by Fr\""oman and Fr\""oman, is used
for computing cosmological perturbations in the power-law inflationary model.
The phase-integral formulas for the scalar and tensor power spectra are
explicitly obtained up to ninth-order of the phase-integral approximation. We
show that, the phase-integral approximation exactly reproduces the shape of the
power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations as well as the spectral
indices. We compare the accuracy of the phase-integral approximation with the
results for the power spectrum obtained with the slow-roll and uniform
approximation methods.",2007-03-22T15:18:56Z
On the roughness of single- and bi-layer graphene membranes,"We present a detailed transmission electron microscopy and electron
diffraction study of the thinnest possible membrane, a single layer of carbon
atoms suspended in vacuum and attached only at its edges. Membranes consisting
of two graphene layers are also reported. We find that the membranes exhibit an
apparently random spontaneous curvature that is strongest in single-layer
membranes. A direct visualization of the roughness is presented for two-layer
membranes where we used the variation of diffracted intensities with the local
orientation of the membrane.",2007-03-01T19:09:40Z
Nature of well-defined conductance of amine anchored molecular junctions,"Amine terminated molecules show well behaved conductance in the scanning
tunneling microscope break-junction experimental measurements. We performed
density functional theory based electron transport calculations to explain the
nature of this phenomenon. We find that amines can be adsorbed only on apex Au
atom, while thiolate group can be attached equally well to undercoordinated and
clean Au surfaces. Our calculations show that only one adsorption geo metry is
sterically and energetically possible for amine anchored junction whereas three
different adsorption geometries with very distinct transport pro perties are
almost equally probable for thiolate anchored junction. We calculated the
conductance as a function of the junction stretching when the molecules are
pulled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip from the Au electrode. Our
calculations show that the stretching of the thiolate anchored junction during
its formation is accompanied by significant electrode geometry distortio n. The
amine anchored junctions exhibit very different behavior -- the electrode
remains intact when the scan ning tunneling microscope tip stretches the
junction.",2007-02-21T23:47:12Z
"A new measure of Delta alpha/alpha at redshift z = 1.84 from very high
  resolution spectra of Q1101-264","We probe the evolution of the fine-structure constant, alpha, with cosmic
time. Accurate positions of the FeII lines 1608, 2382,and 2600 A are measured
in the z = 1.84 absorption system from a high-resolution (FWHM = 3.8 km/s) and
high signal-to-noise (S/N >= 100) spectrum of the quasar Q1101-264 (z_em =
2.15, V = 16.0), integrated for 15.4 hours. The Single Ion Differential alpha
Measurement (SIDAM) procedure and the Delta chi^2 method are used to set
constraints on Delta alpha/alpha. We have found a relative radial velocity
shift between the 1608 A and 2382,2600 A lines of Delta v = -180 +/- 85 m/s
(both random and systematic errors are included), which, if real, would
correspond to Delta alpha/alpha = (5.4 +/- 2.5) 10^{-6} (1sigma C.L.).
Considering the strong implications of a such variability, additional
observations with comparable accuracy at redshift z ~ 1.8 are required to
confirm this result.",2007-03-02T09:30:59Z
Superconductivity in Heavy Alkaline-Earths Intercalated Graphites,"We report the discovery of superconductivity below 1.65(6) K in
Sr-intercalated graphite SrC6, by susceptibility and specific heat (Cp)
measurements. In comparison with CaC6, we found that the anisotropy of the
upper critical fields for SrC6 is much reduced. The Cp anomaly at Tc is smaller
than the BCS prediction indicating an anisotropic superconducting gap for SrC6
similar to CaC6. The significantly lower Tc of SrC6 as compared to CaC6 can be
understood in terms of ""negative"" pressure effects, which decreases the
electron-phonon coupling for both in-plane intercalant and the out-of-plane C

"Electrodynamics of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconducting
  state","We develop the Ginzburg-Landau theory of the vortex lattice in clean
isotropic three-dimensional superconductors at large Maki parameter, when
inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state is favored. We show that
diamagnetic superfluid currents mainly come from paramagnetic interaction of
electron spins with local magnetic field, and not from kinetic energy response
to the external field as usual. We find that the stable vortex lattice keeps
its triangular structure as in usual Abrikosov mixed state, while the internal
magnetic field acquires components perpendicular to applied magnetic field.
Experimental possibilities related to this prediction are discussed.",2007-03-05T15:20:10Z
"Simulation studies of permeation through two-dimensional ideal polymer
  networks","We study the diffusion process through an ideal polymer network, using
numerical methods. Polymers are modeled by random walks on the bonds of a
two-dimensional square lattice. Molecules occupy the lattice cells and may jump
to the nearest-neighbor cells, with probability determined by the occupation of
the bond separating the two cells. Subjected to a concentration gradient across
the system, a constant average current flows in the steady state. Its behavior
appears to be a non-trivial function of polymer length, mass density and

"Finite-well potential in the 3D nonlinear Schroedinger equation:
  Application to Bose-Einstein condensation","Using variational and numerical solutions we show that stationary
negative-energy localized (normalizable) bound states can appear in the
three-dimensional nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with a finite square-well
potential for a range of nonlinearity parameters. Below a critical attractive
nonlinearity, the system becomes unstable and experiences collapse. Above a
limiting repulsive nonlinearity, the system becomes highly repulsive and cannot
be bound. The system also allows nonnormalizable states of infinite norm at
positive energies in the continuum. The normalizable negative-energy bound

"Nuclear spin population and its control toward initialization using an

demonstrate its initialization using an all-electrical nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) device. In our device, nuclear spins are dynamically polarized
in a sub-micron scale region defined by split gates. The nuclear spin
populations under various polarization conditions are estimated from
resistively-detected pulsed NMR spectra. We find that nuclear spin populations
are determined by electron spin configurations. By applying radio frequency
pulses to the strongly polarized nuclear spins, we demonstrate the creation of
two-qubit effective pure states, which is a crucial step toward NMR quantum
computation.",2007-02-05T05:06:57Z
"Asymptotic near nucleus structure of the electron-interaction potential
  in local effective potential theories","In local effective potential theories of electronic structure, the electron
correlations due to the Pauli exclusion principle, Coulomb repulsion, and
correlation-kinetic effects, are all incorporated in the local
electron-interaction potential $v_{ee}({\bf r})$. In previous work, it has been
shown that for spherically symmetric or sphericalized systems, the asymptotic
near nucleus expansion of this potential is $v_{ee}(r) = v_{ee}(0) + \beta r +
O(r^2)$, with $v_{ee}(0)$ being finite. By assuming that the Schr\""odinger and
local effective potential theory wave functions are analytic near the nucleus
of atoms, we prove the following via Quantal density functional theory (Q-DFT):
(i) correlations due to the Pauli principle and Coulomb correlations do not
contribute to the linear structure; (ii) these Pauli and Coulomb correlations
contribute quadratically; (iii) the linear structure is {\em solely} due to
correlation-kinetic effects, the contributions of these effects being
determined analytically. We also derive by application of adiabatic coupling
constant perturbation theory via Q-DFT (iv) the asymptotic near nucleus
expansion of the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham theory exchange $v_x({\bf r})$ and
correlation $v_c({\bf r})$ potentials. These functions also approach the
nucleus linearly with the linear term of $v_x({\bf r})$ being {\em solely} due
to the lowest-order correlation kinetic effects, and the linear term of
$v_c({\bf r})$ being due {\em solely} to the higher-order correlation kinetic
contributions. The above conclusions are equally valid for systems of arbitrary

  scintillator host material, KMgF_3","The high-pressure structural behaviour of the fluoroperovskite KMgF_3 is
investigated by theory and experiment. Density functional calculations were
performed within the local density approximation and the generalized gradient
approximation for exchange and correlation effects, as implemented within the
full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method. In situ high-pressure powder
x-ray diffraction experiments were performed up to a maximum pressure of 40 GPa
using synchrotron radiation. We find that the cubic Pm\bar{3}m crystal symmetry
persists throughout the pressure range studied. The calculated ground state
properties -- the equilibrium lattice constant, bulk modulus and elastic
constants -- are in good agreement with experimental results. By analyzing the
ratio between the bulk and shear modulii, we conclude that KMgF_3 is brittle in
nature. Under ambient conditions, KMgF_3 is found to be an indirect gap
insulator with the gap increasing under pressure.",2007-03-23T14:57:18Z
Controlling surface morphologies by time-delayed feedback,"We propose a new method to control the roughness of a growing surface, via a
time-delayed feedback scheme. As an illustration, we apply this method to the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in 1+1 dimensions and show that the effective
growth exponent of the surface width can be stabilized at any desired value in
the interval [0.25,0.33], for a significant length of time. The method is quite
general and can be applied to a wide range of growth phenomena. A possible
experimental realization is suggested.",2007-01-09T13:10:41Z
Spatially resolved photo ionization of ultracold atoms on an atom chip,"We report on photo ionization of ultracold magnetically trapped Rb atoms on
an atom chip. The atoms are trapped at 5 $\mu $K in a strongly anisotropic
trap. Through a hole in the chip with a diameter of 150 $\mu $m two laser beams
are focussed onto a fraction of the atomic cloud. A first laser beam with a
wavelength of 778 nm excites the atoms via a two photon transition to the 5D
level. With a fiber laser at 1080 nm the excited atoms are photo ionized.
Ionization leads to depletion of the atomic density distribution observed by
absorption imaging. The resonant ionization spectrum is reported. The setup
used in this experiment is not only suitable to investigate BEC ion mixtures
but also single atom detection on an atom chip.",2007-02-08T16:09:58Z
Structure and Aggregation of a Helix-Forming Polymer,"We have studied the competition between helix formation and aggregation for a
simple polymer model. We present simulation results for a system of two such
polymers, examining the potential of mean force, the balance between inter and
intramolecular interactions, and the promotion or disruption of secondary
structure brought on by the proximity of the two molecules. In particular, we
demonstrate that proximity between two such molecules can stabilize secondary
structure. However, for this model, observed secondary structure is not stable
enough to prevent collapse of the system into an unstructured globule.",2007-02-15T10:58:36Z
"Invariant template matching in systems with spatiotemporal coding: a
  vote for instability","We consider the design of a pattern recognition that matches templates to
images, both of which are spatially sampled and encoded as temporal sequences.
The image is subject to a combination of various perturbations. These include
ones that can be modeled as parameterized uncertainties such as image blur,
luminance, translation, and rotation as well as unmodeled ones. Biological and
neural systems require that these perturbations be processed through a minimal
number of channels by simple adaptation mechanisms. We found that the most
suitable mathematical framework to meet this requirement is that of weakly
attracting sets. This framework provides us with a normative and unifying
solution to the pattern recognition problem. We analyze the consequences of its
explicit implementation in neural systems. Several properties inherent to the
systems designed in accordance with our normative mathematical argument
coincide with known empirical facts. This is illustrated in mental rotation,
visual search and blur/intensity adaptation. We demonstrate how our results can
be applied to a range of practical problems in template matching and pattern
recognition.",2007-02-14T07:01:56Z
"Observation of Spin Wave Soliton Fractals in Magnetic Film Active
  Feedback Rings","The manifestation of fractals in soliton dynamics has been observed for the
first time. The experiment utilized self-generated spin wave envelope solitons
in a magnetic film based active feedback ring. At high ring gain, the soliton
that circulates in the ring breathes in a fractal pattern. The corresponding
power frequency spectrum shows a comb structure, with each peak in the comb
having its own comb, and so on, to finer and finer scales.",2007-01-23T00:12:43Z
Suppression of spin relaxation in an InAs nanowire double quantum dot,"We investigate the triplet-singlet relaxation in a double quantum dot defined
by top-gates in an InAs nanowire. In the Pauli spin blockade regime, the
leakage current can be mainly attributed to spin relaxation. While at weak and
strong inter-dot coupling relaxation is dominated by two individual mechanisms,
the relaxation is strongly reduced at intermediate coupling and finite magnetic
field. In addition we observe a charateristic bistability of the spin-non
conserving current as a function of magnetic field. We propose a model where
these features are explained by the polarization of nuclear spins enabled by
the interplay between hyperfine and spin-orbit mediated relaxation.",2007-01-03T17:24:33Z
"A geometric growth model interpolating between regular and small-world
  networks","We propose a geometric growth model which interpolates between
one-dimensional linear graphs and small-world networks. The model undergoes a
transition from large to small worlds. We study the topological characteristics
by both theoretical predictions and numerical simulations, which are in good
accordance with each other. Our geometrically growing model is a
complementarity for the static WS model.",2007-01-11T07:49:31Z
Matter Wave Scattering and Guiding by Atomic Arrays,"We investigate the possibility that linear arrays of atoms can guide matter
waves, much as fiber optics guide light. We model the atomic line as a quasi-1D
array of s wave point scatterers embedded in 2D. Our theoretical study reveals
how matter wave guiding arises from the interplay of scattering phenomena with
bands and conduction along the array. We discuss the conditions under which a
straight or curved array of atoms can guide a beam focused at one end of the
array.",2007-03-07T15:00:09Z
Balls-in-boxes condensation on networks,"We discuss two different regimes of condensate formation in zero-range
processes on networks: on a q-regular network, where the condensate is formed
as a result of a spontaneous symmetry breaking, and on an irregular network,
where the symmetry of the partition function is explicitly broken. In the
latter case we consider a minimal irregularity of the q-regular network
introduced by a single Q-node with degree Q>q. The statics and dynamics of the
condensation depends on the parameter log(Q/q), which controls the exponential
fall-off of the distribution of particles on regular nodes and the typical time
scale for melting of the condensate on the Q-node which increases exponentially
with the system size $N$. This behavior is different than that on a q-regular
network where log(Q/q)=0 and where the condensation results from the
spontaneous symmetry breaking of the partition function, which is invariant
under a permutation of particle occupation numbers on the q-nodes of the
network. In this case the typical time scale for condensate melting is known to
increase typically as a power of the system size.",2007-01-23T14:07:08Z
"Mechanism of enhancement of electromagnetic properties of MgB2 by
  nano-SiC doping","A comparative study of pure, SiC, and C doped MgB2 wires has revealed that
the SiC doping allowed C substitution and MgB2 formation to take place
simultaneously at low temperatures. C substitution enhances Hc2, while the
defects, small grain size and nanoinclusions induced by C incorporation and low
temperature processing are responsible for the improvement in Jc. The
irreversibility field (Hirr) for the SiC doped sample reached the benchmarking
value of 10 T at 20 K, exceeding that of NbTi at 4.2 K. This dual reaction
model also enables us to predict desirable dopants for enhancing the
performance properties of MgB2.",2007-01-16T23:16:20Z
Byzantine Fault Tolerance for Nondeterministic Applications,"All practical applications contain some degree of nondeterminism. When such
applications are replicated to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), their
nondeterministic operations must be controlled to ensure replica consistency.
To the best of our knowledge, only the most simplistic types of replica
nondeterminism have been dealt with. Furthermore, there lacks a systematic
approach to handling common types of nondeterminism. In this paper, we propose
a classification of common types of replica nondeterminism with respect to the
requirement of achieving Byzantine fault tolerance, and describe the design and
implementation of the core mechanisms necessary to handle such nondeterminism
within a Byzantine fault tolerance framework.",2007-01-21T20:44:52Z
The QUEST Data Processing Software Pipeline,"A program that we call the QUEST Data Processing Software Pipeline has been
written to process the large volumes of data produced by the QUEST camera on
the Samuel Oschin Schmidt Telescope at the Palomar Observatory. The program
carries out both aperture and PSF photometry, combines data from different
repeated observations of the same portion of sky, and produces a Master Object
Catalog. A rough calibration of the data is carried out. This program, as well
as the calibration procedures and quality checks on the output are described.",2007-03-16T16:30:00Z
"Fluctuation effects in the theory of microphase separation of diblock
  copolymers in the presence of an electric field","We generalize the Fredrickson-Helfand theory of the microphase separation in
symmetric diblock copolymer melts by taking into account the influence of a
time-independent homogeneous electric field on the composition fluctuations
within the self-consistent Hartree approximation. We predict that electric
fields suppress composition fluctuations, and consequently weaken the
first-order transition. In the presence of an electric field the critical
temperature of the order-disorder transition is shifted towards its mean-field
value. The collective structure factor in the disordered phase becomes
anisotropic in the presence of the electric field. Fluctuational modulations of
the order parameter along the field direction are strongest suppressed. The
latter is in accordance with the parallel orientation of the lamellae in the
ordered state.",2007-02-19T13:47:44Z
"Coupled Effects in Quantum Dot Nanostructures with Nonlinear Strain and
  Bridging Modelling Scales","We demonstrate that the conventional application of linear models to the
analysis of optoelectromechanical properties of nanostructures in bandstructure
engineering could be inadequate. The focus of the present paper is on a model
based on the coupled Schrodinger-Poisson system where we account consistently
for the piezoelectric effect and analyze the influence of different nonlinear
terms in strain components. The examples given in this paper show that the
piezoelectric effect contributions are essential and have to be accounted for
with fully coupled models. While in structural applications of piezoelectric
materials at larger scales, the minimization of the full electromechanical
energy is now a routine in many engineering applications, in bandstructure
engineering conventional approaches are still based on linear models with
minimization of uncoupled, purely elastic energy functionals with respect to
displacements. Generalizations of the existing models for bandstructure
calculations are presented in this paper in the context of coupled effects.",2007-02-25T14:45:31Z
"Magnetic field induced Coulomb blockade in small disordered delta-doped
  heterostructures","At low densities, electrons confined to two dimensions in a delta-doped
heterostructure can arrange themselves into self-consistent droplets due to
disorder and screening effects. We use this observation to show that at low
temperatures, there should be resistance oscillations in low density two
dimensional electron gases as a function of the gate voltage, that are greatly
enhanced in a magnetic field. These oscillations are intrinsic to small samples
and give way to variable range hopping resistivity at low temperatures in
larger samples. We place our analysis in the context of recent experiments
where similar physical effects have been discussed from the point of view of a
Wigner crystal or charge density wave picture.",2007-02-13T18:25:11Z
Coherent acoustic vibration of metal nanoshells,"Using time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy we have performed the first
investigation of the vibrational modes of gold nanoshells. The fundamental
isotropic mode launched by a femtosecond pump pulse manifests itself in a
pronounced time-domain modulation of the differential transmission probed at
the frequency of nanoshell surface plasmon resonance. The modulation amplitude
is significantly stronger and the period is longer than in a gold nanoparticle
of the same overall size, in agreement with theoretical calculations. This
distinct acoustical signature of nanoshells provides a new and efficient method
for identifying these versatile nanostructures and for studying their
mechanical and structural properties.",2007-01-10T21:22:11Z
"Emergence of a negative charging energy in a metallic dot capacitively
  coupled to a superconducting island","We consider the hybrid setup formed by a metallic dot, capacitively coupled
to a superconducting island S connected to a bulk superconductor by a Josephson
junction. Charge fluctuations in S act as a dynamical gate and overscreen the
electronic repulsion in the metallic dot, producing an attractive interaction
between two additional electrons. As the offset charge of the metallic dot is
increased, the dot charging curve shows positive steps ($+2e$) followed by
negative ones ($-e$) signaling the occurrence of a negative differential
capacitance. A proposal for experimental detection is given, and potential
applications in nanoelectronics are mentioned.",2007-03-15T14:32:20Z
"Effective density of states profiles of heterogeneous microcrystalline
  silicon","The steady state photoconductivity as a function of temperature and light
intensity was measured on plasma deposited highly crystalline undoped
hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon films possessing different thicknesses
and microstructures. Different phototransport behaviors were observed
experimentally in films having dissimilar microstructural attributes. This has
been explained by numerical modeling to link these behaviors to different
features of the proposed density of states maps of the material.",2007-02-16T08:23:48Z
"Quasi-particle transitions in charge-phase qubits probed by rf
  oscillations","We investigated transitions in Al charge-phase qubits of SQUID-configuration
inductively coupled to an rf tank circuit that made it possible to read out the
state by measuring the inductance of the qubit. Depending on the flux and
charge bias and the amplitude of the rf oscillations we probed either the
ground state or a dynamic change of the qubit states which we attributed to
stochastic single quasi-particle tunneling onto and off the qubit island and
exchange of energy with the qubit. Within this model, a selection rule for
quasi-particle-induced transitions in the qubit is discussed.",2007-01-08T12:50:09Z
No-Go Theorem for Energy-Momentum Conservation in Curved Spacetime,"It is pointed out that in curved spacetime, one cannot define the sum of
energy-momemtum 4-vector over a space-like hypersurface. The difficulty in
finding satisfactory gravitational energy-momentum complex stems from
misunderstanding of this question. The law of conservation of energy-momentum
holds valid only approximately when spacetime is not seriously curved.",2007-02-10T04:16:18Z
Inverse slow relaxation in granular hopping systems,"We present experimental results that demonstrate a glassy behavior in the
conductance of quench condensed insulating granular metals that is different
from that observed in continuous disordered systems. Exciting the granular
system by biasing the sample with a high electric field results in a slow
conductance change both during the excitation and during the relaxation back to
its steady state. The time scales for these processes are many orders of
magnitudes longer than the typical hopping time. We find that, initially, this
conductance change has an opposite sign to that observed in similar experiments
performed on continuous films. Only after relatively long times this trend is
reversed and the samples exhibit conventional behavior. We suggest that the
granular systems exhibit a new glassy process related to charge redistribution
among the grains. This process combines with the relaxation processes that are
characteristic of disordered systems to give rise to a unique relaxation
profile.",2007-01-16T05:35:43Z
"Influence of structural disorder on low-temperature behavior of
  penetration depth in electron-doped high-T_C thin films","To probe the influence of structural disorder on low-temperature behavior of
magnetic penetration depth in electron-doped high-T_C superconductors, a
comparative study of high-quality Pr_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_4 (PCCO) and
Sm_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_4 (SCCO) thin films is presented. The obtained results
confirm a d-wave pairing mechanism in both samples, substantially modified by
impurity scattering (which is more noticeable in less homogeneous SCCO films)
at the lowest temperatures. The value of the extracted impurity scattering rate
correlates with the quality of our samples and is found to be much higher in
less homogeneous films with lower T_C.",2007-01-18T18:40:17Z
"Differential Geometry of Polymer Models: Worm-like Chains, Ribbons and
  Fourier Knots","We analyze several continuum models of polymers: worm-like chains, ribbons
and Fourier knots. We show that the torsion of worm-like chains diverges and
conclude that such chains can not be described by the Frenet-Serret (FS)
equation of space curves. While the same holds for ribbons as well, their rate
of twist is finite and, therefore, they can be described by the generalized FS
equation of stripes. Finally, Fourier knots have finite curvature and torsion
and, therefore, are sufficiently smooth to be described by the FS equation of
space curves.",2007-02-08T12:14:06Z
"Enhancing capacity of coherent optical information storage and transfer
  in a Bose-Einstein condensate","Coherent optical information storage capacity of an atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate is examined. Theory of slow light propagation in atomic clouds is
generalized to short pulse regime by taking into account group velocity
dispersion. It is shown that the number of stored pulses in the condensate can
be optimized for a particular coupling laser power, temperature and interatomic
interaction strength. Analytical results are derived for semi-ideal model of
the condensate using effective uniform density zone approximation. Detailed
numerical simulations are also performed. It is found that axial density
profile of the condensate protects the pulse against the group velocity
dispersion. Furthermore, taking into account finite radial size of the
condensate, multi-mode light propagation in atomic Bose-Einstein condensate is
investigated. The number of modes that can be supported by a condensate is
found. Single mode condition is determined as a function of experimentally
accessible parameters including trap size, temperature, condensate number
density and scattering length. Quantum coherent atom-light interaction schemes
are proposed for enhancing multi-mode light propagation effects.",2007-01-18T12:26:36Z
Critical properties and Bose Einstein Condensation in dimer spin systems,"We analyze the spin relaxation time $1/T_1$ for a system made of weakly
coupled one dimensional ladders.This system allows to probe the dimensional
crossover between a Luttinger liquid and a Bose-Einstein condensateof magnons.
We obtain the temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ in the various dimensional
regimes, and discuss the experimental consequences.",2007-01-24T11:58:09Z
"Magnetron Sputter deposition of a 48-member cuprate superconductor
  library: Bi2Sr2YxCa1-xCu2Oy (0.5 <= x <= 1) linearly varying in steps of 0.01","Using magnetron sputtering, a spatial composition spread approach was applied
successfully to obtain 48-member libraries of the Bi2Sr2YxCa1-xCu2Oy (0.5<= x
<=1)cuprate superconducting system. The libraries of each system were deposited
onto (100) single crystal MgO, mounted on a water cooled rotating table, using
two targets: the antiferromagnetic insulator Bi2Sr2YCu2Oy (P=98 W RF) and the
hole doped superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (P=44 W DC). A low chamber pressure of
0.81 mTorr argon is used to reduce scattering by the process gas. To minimize
oxygen resputtering a substrate bias of -20 V was used as well as a process gas
free of oxygen. A rapid thermal processor is used to post-anneal the amorphous
deposited films. A step annealing regime was used, with a ramp rate of 5
degrees C/s for heating and cooling, with a first plateau at 780 C held for 200
s, and a second at 875 C held for 480 s. X-ray diffraction reveals that the
films develop crystalline order with the c-axis lattice parameter contracting
linearly from 30.55 Angstroms (x=0.5) to 30.24 Angstroms (x=1.0) with
increasing Y-content, consistent with bulk values. The crystallized films are
polycrystalline, developing preferred orientation (c-axis parallel to the
substrate) for thinner members of the library. There is a change of 0.01 in
doping per library member which will enable further studies to densely map
phase space.",2007-02-02T01:47:31Z
Driving particle current through narrow channels using classical pump,"We study a symmetric exclusion process in which the hopping rates at two
chosen adjacent sites vary periodically in time and have a relative phase
difference. This mimics a colloidal suspension subjected to external space and
time dependent modulation of the diffusion constant. The two special sites act
as a classical pump by generating an oscillatory current with a nonzero ${\cal
DC}$ value whose direction depends on the applied phase difference. We analyze
various features in this model through simulations and obtain an expression for
the $\cal{DC}$ current via a novel perturbative treatment.",2007-03-13T12:21:04Z
Suppression of electron spin decoherence in a quantum dot,"The dominant source of decoherence for an electron spin in a quantum dot is
the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding bath of nuclear spins. The
decoherence process may be slowed down by subjecting the electron spin to
suitable sequences of external control pulses. We investigate the performance
of a variety of dynamical decoupling protocols using exact numerical
simulation. Emphasis is given to realistic pulse delays and the long-time
limit, beyond the domain where available analytical approaches are guaranteed
to work. Our results show that both deterministic and randomized protocols are
capable to significantly prolong the electron coherence time, even when using
control pulse separations substantially larger than what expected from the {\em
upper cutoff} frequency of the coupling spectrum between the electron and the
nuclear spins. In a realistic parameter range, the {\em total width} of such a
coupling spectrum appears to be the physically relevant frequency scale
affecting the overall quality of the decoupling.",2007-03-17T00:07:32Z
"Pairing in disordered s-wave superconductors and the effect of their
  coupling","Inhomogeneity is introduced through random local interactions (Ui) in an
attractive Hubbard model on a square lattice and studied using mean-field
Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. Superconductivity is found to get suppressed by
the random Ui contrary to the results of a bimodal distribution of Ui. The
proximity effect of superconductivity is found to be strong, all sites develop
non-zero pairing amplitude. The gap in the density of states is always non-zero
and does not vanish even for strong disorder. When two such superconductors are
coupled via a channel, the effect of one on the other is negligible. The length
and width of the connector, do not seem to have any noticeable effect on the
superconductivity in either systems. The superconducting blocks behave as
independent entity and the introduction of the channel have no effect on them.",2007-02-06T16:25:46Z
"Wavefront singularities associated with the conical point in elastic
  solids with cubic symmetry","The wavefronts from a point source in a solid with cubic symmetry are
examined with particular attention paid to the contribution from the conical
points of the slowness surface. An asymptotic solution is developed that is
uniform across the edge of the cone in real space, the interior of which
contains the plane lid wavefront analyzed by Burridge \cite{Burridge67}. The
uniform solution also contains the regular wavefronts away from the cone edge,
a delta pulse on one side and its Hilbert transform on the other. In the
direction of the cone edge the three wavefronts merge to produce a singularity
of the form $H(t) t^{-3/4}$.",2007-02-06T01:34:11Z
Field Stability in Direct Modulation of Semiconductor Laser,"We studied the rate equations of direct modulation laser and showed that it
may be reduced to the special case when spontaneous carrier decay rate is equal
to the photon decay rate. The solution in this case is unique. For the general
case, we investigated the vector field of the differential system of the rate
equations and pointed out the basic stability problems of this system when the
modulation current was required to change.",2007-01-27T10:52:03Z
"Optical properties of \textit{n}- and \textit{p}-type ZnO thin films --
  two different approaches to the impurity distribution inhomogeneity","We investigated the optical properties of epitaxial \textit{n}- and
\textit{p}-type ZnO films grown on lattice-matched ScAlMgO$_4$ substrates.
Chemical doping yielded a severe inhomogeneity in a statistical distribution of
involved charged impurities. Two approaches are adopted to treat the
inhomogeneity effects; Monte Carlo simulation technique for the
\textit{n}-doped films, and the fluctuation theory for the \textit{p}-ZnO. The
broadening of PL band of \textit{n}-ZnO was significantly larger than predicted
by theoretical results in which the linewidths of each individual emissions
have been determined mainly from the concentration fluctuation of donor-type
dopants by the simulation. Moreover, the rather asymmetrical line shape was
observed. To explain these features, a vibronic model was developed accounting
for contributions from a series of phonon replicas. In case of \textit{p}-type
ZnO:N, analysis of excitation-intensity dependence of the peak shift of
donor-acceptor luminescence with a fluctuation model has also proven the
importance of the inhomogeneity effect of charged impurity distribution, as in
the case of ZnO:Ga. We extracted the inhomogeneity in the sample and acceptor
activation energy prepared under the various growth conditions. It is shown
that the theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental 5-K
time-resolved luminescence for the systems in a fluctuation field. Finally,
localized-state distributions have been studied in N-doped ZnO thin films by
means of transient photocurrent measurement.",2007-01-31T07:17:49Z
Nonequilibrium dynamics of polymer translocation and straightening,"When a flexible polymer is sucked into a localized small hole, the chain can
initially respond only locally and the sequential nonequilibrium processes
follow in line with the propagation of the tensile force along the chain
backbone. We analyze this dynamical process by taking the nonuniform stretching
of the polymer into account both with and without hydrodynamics interactions.
Earlier conjectures on the absorption time are criticized and new formulae are
proposed together with time evolutions of relevant dynamical variables.",2007-03-13T01:56:58Z
"High field level crossing studies on spin dimers in the low dimensional
  quantum spin system Na$_2$T$_2$(C$_2$O$_4$)$_3$(H$_2$O)$_2$ with
  T=Ni,Co,Fe,Mn","In this paper we demonstrate the application of high magnetic fields to study
the magnetic properties of low dimensional spin systems. We present a case
study on the series of 2-leg spin-ladder compounds
Na$_2$T$_2$(C$_2$O$_4$)$_3$(H$_2$O)$_2$ with T = Ni, Co, Fe and Mn. In all
compounds the transition metal is in the $T^{2+}$ high spin configuation. The
localized spin varies from S=1 to 3/2, 2 and 5/2 within this series. The
magnetic properties were examined experimentally by magnetic susceptibility,
pulsed high field magnetization and specific heat measurements. The data are
analysed using a spin hamiltonian description. Although the transition metal
ions form structurally a 2-leg ladder, an isolated dimer model consistently
describes the observations very well. This behaviour can be understood in terms
of the different coordination and superexchange angles of the oxalate ligands
along the rungs and legs of the 2-leg spin ladder. All compounds exhibit
magnetic field driven ground state changes which at very low temperatures lead
to a multistep behaviour in the magnetization curves. In the Co and Fe
compounds a strong axial anisotropy induced by the orbital magnetism leads to a
nearly degenerate ground state and a strongly reduced critical field. We find a
monotonous decrease of the intradimer magnetic exchange if the spin quantum
number is increased.",2007-01-23T23:50:44Z
Gapped solitons and periodic excitations in strongly coupled BEC,"It is found that localized solitons in the strongly coupled cigar shaped
Bose-Einstein condensate form two distinct classes. The one without a
background is an asymptotically vanishing, localized soliton, having a
wave-number, which has a lower bound in magnitude. Periodic soliton trains
exist only in the presence of a background, where the localized soliton has a
\textit{W}-type density profile. This soliton is well suited for trapping of
neutral atoms and is found to be stable under Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion, as
well as numerical evolution. We identify an insulating phase of this system in
the presence of an optical lattice. It is demonstrated that the ${\it W}$-type
density profile can be precisely controlled through trap dynamics.",2007-03-03T16:04:27Z
"Majorana Fermions, Exact Mappings between Classical and Topological
  Orders","Motivated by the duality between site-centered spin and bond-centered spin in
one-dimensional system, which connects two different constructions of fermions
from the same set of Majorana fermions, we show that two-dimensional models
with topological orders can be constructed from certain well-known models with
classical orders characterized by symmetry-breaking. Topology-dependent ground
state degeneracy, vanishing two-point correlation functions, and unpaired
Majorana fermions on boundaries emerge naturally from such construction. The
approach opens a new way to construct and characterize topological orders.",2007-02-15T15:52:22Z
"First Principles Study on the Formation of Yttrium Nitride in Cubic and
  Hexagonal Phases","We have studied the formation of yttrium nitride in which the Y-atoms were
arranged in two common close-packed stacking: The AB-stacking (hcp-symmetry) is
the ground state of metallic yttrium; while the ABC-stacking (fcc-symmetry) is
the ground state of yttrium nitride. Given the different symmetries between YN
and Y, there must be a phase transition (hcp->fcc) as N is incorporated in the
Y-lattice. By means of first principles calculations we have made a
systematical investigation where N was gradually incorporated in octahedral
interstices in AB and ABC stacking of Y. We report the heat of formation, bulk
modulus, lattice parameter and electronic structure of the resultant nitrides.
We found that both metal arrangements are physically achievable. Furthermore,
for low nitrogen incorporation the two phases may coexist. However for high
nitrogen concentration the cubic phases are favored by a 30 kJ mol-1 margin.
These results are important since fcc-YN is semiconducting and could be
utilized as active layer in electronic devices.",2007-03-22T05:32:02Z
"Representing molecule-surface interactions with symmetry-adapted neural
  networks","The accurate description of molecule-surface interactions requires a detailed
knowledge of the underlying potential-energy surface (PES). Recently, neural
networks (NNs) have been shown to be an efficient technique to accurately
interpolate the PES information provided for a set of molecular configurations,
e.g. by first-principles calculations. Here, we further develop this approach
by building the NN on a new type of symmetry functions, which allows to take
the symmetry of the surface exactly into account. The accuracy and efficiency
of such symmetry-adapted NNs is illustrated by the application to a
six-dimensional PES describing the interaction of oxygen molecules with the
Al(111) surface.",2007-02-22T12:55:05Z
"New detections of H2O masers in planetary nebulae and post-AGB stars
  using the Robledo-70m antenna","Aims: We investigated the possible relationship between the evolutionary
stage of post-AGB stars and planetary nebulae (PNe) and the presence of water
masers in their envelopes.
  Methods: We have used NASA's 70-m antenna in Robledo de Chavela (Spain) to
search for the water maser transition at 22235.08 MHz, towards a sample of 105
sources with IRAS colour characteristic of post-AGB stars and PNe at
declination >-32 deg. 83% of the sources in the sample are post-AGB stars, 15%
PNe or PN candidates, while only 2% seem to be HII regions.
  Results: We have detected five water masers, of which four are reported for
the first time: two in PNe (IRAS 17443-2949 and IRAS 18061-2505), a ``water
fountain'' in a post-AGB star (IRAS 16552-3050), and one in a source previously
catalogued as a PN, but whose classification is uncertain (IRAS 17580-3111).
  Conclusions: The unexpected detections of water masers in two objects among
the small subset of PNe led us to suggest that the PNe harbouring water masers
are a special type of massive, rapidly evolving PNe.",2007-03-19T19:41:10Z
Supernova neutrinos,"A nascent neutron star resulting from stellar collapse is a prodigious source
of neutrinos of all flavors. While the most basic features of this neutrino
emission can be estimated from simple considerations, the detailed simulation
of the neutrinos' decoupling from the hot neutron star is not yet
computationally tractable in its full glory, being a time-dependent
six-dimensional transport problem. Nevertheless, supernova neutrino fluxes are
of great interest in connection with the core-collapse supernova explosion
mechanism and supernova nucleosynthesis, and as a potential probe of the
supernova environment and of some of the neutrino mixing parameters that remain
unknown; hence a variety of approximate transport schemes have been used to
obtain results with reduced dimensionality. However, none of these approximate
schemes have addressed a recent challenge to the conventional wisdom that
neutrino flavor mixing cannot impact the explosion mechanism or r-process
nucleosynthesis.",2007-03-13T19:39:41Z
Nonequilibrium tricriticality in one dimension,"We show the existence of a nonequilibrium tricritical point induced by a
repulsive interaction in one dimensional asymmetric exclusion process. The
tricritical point is associated with the particle-hole symmetry breaking
introduced by the repulsion. The phase diagram and the crossover in the
neighbourhood of the tricritical point for the shock formation at one of the
boundaries are determined.",2007-03-15T13:00:28Z
"Minimum Rate of Dissipation Principle and Linear Corrections to the
  Onsager Matrix","The Minimum Rate of Dissipation Principle (MRDP) affirms that, for
time-independent boundary conditions, a thermodynamic system evolves towards a
steady-state with the least possible dissipation. In this note, examples of
diffusion processes of two solutes in an isothermal system are analyzed in
detail. In particular, we consider the relaxation of the system when the metric
tensor (i.e. the Onsager matrix) is constant and when the Onsager coefficients
weakly depend on the spatial derivatives of the concentrations. We show that,
to leading order, during the relaxation towards a steady-state, the system
traces out a geodesic in the space of thermodynamic configurations, in
accordance with the MRDP.",2007-03-12T14:34:36Z
Kinetic Theory of the Heat Capacity of Two-Level Systems,"It is shown that measured heat capacity depends on the rate of the
temperature variation and on the initial state of a system. It is calculated
here in the framework of two-level model. Fenomenological approach gives the
same results.",2007-02-04T15:12:12Z
"On the Software and Knowledge Engineering Aspects of the Educational
  Process","The Hellenic Open University has embarked on a large-scale effort to enhance
its textbook-based material with content that demonstrably supports the basic
tenets of distance learning. The challenge is to set up a framework that allows
for the production-level creation, distribution and consumption of content, and
at the same time, evaluate the effort in terms of technological, educational
and organizational knowledge gained. This paper presents a model of the
educational process that is used as a development backbone and argues about its

"Influence of chemical and magnetic interface properties of Co-Fe-B / MgO
  / Co-Fe-B tunnel junctions on the annealing temperature dependence of the
  magnetoresistance","The knowledge of chemical and magnetic conditions at the Co40Fe40B20 / MgO
interface is important to interpret the strong annealing temperature dependence
of tunnel magnetoresistance of Co-Fe-B / MgO / Co-Fe-B magnetic tunnel
junctions, which increases with annealing temperature from 20% after annealing
at 200C up to a maximum value of 112% after annealing at 350C. While the well
defined nearest neighbor ordering indicating crystallinity of the MgO barrier
does not change by the annealing, a small amount of interfacial Fe-O at the
lower Co-Fe-B / MgO interface is found in the as grown samples, which is
completely reduced after annealing at 275C. This is accompanied by a
simultaneous increase of the Fe magnetic moment and the tunnel
magnetoresistance. However, the TMR of the MgO based junctions increases
further for higher annealing temperature which can not be caused by Fe-O
reduction. The occurrence of an x-ray absorption near-edge structure above the
Fe and Co L-edges after annealing at 350C indicates the recrystallization of
the Co-Fe-B electrode. This is prerequisite for coherent tunneling and has been
suggested to be responsible for the further increase of the TMR above 275C.
Simultaneously, the B concentration in the Co-Fe-B decreases with increasing
annealing temperature, at least some of the B diffuses towards or into the MgO
barrier and forms a B2O3 oxide.",2007-01-30T13:11:32Z
"Cerenkov-like radiation in a binary Schr{ö}dinger flow past an
  obstacle","We consider the dynamics of two coupled miscible Bose-Einstein condensates,
when an obstacle is dragged through them. The existence of two different speeds
of sound provides the possibility for three dynamical regimes: when both
components are subcritical, we do not observe nucleation of coherent
structures; when both components are supercritical they both form dark solitons
in one dimension (1D) and vortices or rotating vortex dipoles in two dimensions
(2D); in the intermediate regime, we observe the nucleation of a structure in
the form of a dark-antidark soliton in 1D; subcritical component; the 2D analog
of such a structure, a vortex-lump, is also observed.",2007-01-18T08:45:20Z
A new equation for the mid-plane potential of power law disks,"We show that the gravitational potential in the plane of an axisymmetrical
flat disk where the surface density varies as a power of the radius obeys an
inhomogeneous first-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvable by
standard techniques. The potential being exactly known at the origin for any
power index (and at infinity as well), the search for solutions consists of a
Two-point Boundary Value Problem (TBVP) with Dirichlet conditions. The
computating time is then linear with the number of grid points, instead of
quadratic from direct summation methods. Complex mass distributions which can
be decomposed into a mixture of power law surface density profiles are easily
accessible through the superposition principle. This ODE definitively takes the
place of the untractable bidimensional Poisson equation for planar
calculations. It opens new horizons to investigate various aspects related to
self-gravity in astrophysical disks (force calculations, stability analysis,
etc.).",2007-03-23T08:48:52Z
"Citation Advantage For OA Self-Archiving Is Independent of Journal
  Impact Factor, Article Age, and Number of Co-Authors","Eysenbach has suggested that the OA (Green) self-archiving advantage might
just be an artifact of potential uncontrolled confounding factors such as
article age (older articles may be both more cited and more likely to be
self-archived), number of authors (articles with more authors might be more
cited and more self-archived), subject matter (the subjects that are cited
more, self-archive more), country (same thing), number of authors, citation
counts of authors, etc. Chawki Hajjem (doctoral candidate, UQaM) had already
shown that the OA advantage was present in all cases when articles were
analysed separately by age, subject matter or country. He has now done a
multiple regression analysis jointly testing (1) article age, (2) journal
impact factor, (3) number of authors, and (4) OA self-archiving as separate
factors for 442,750 articles in 576 (biomedical) journals across 11 years, and
has shown that each of the four factors contributes an independent,
statistically significant increment to the citation counts. The
OA-self-archiving advantage remains a robust, independent factor. Having
successfully responded to his challenge, we now challenge Eysenbach to
demonstrate -- by testing a sufficiently broad and representative sample of
journals at all levels of the journal quality, visibility and prestige
hierarchy -- that his finding of a citation advantage for Gold OA (articles
published OA on the high-profile website of the only journal he tested (PNAS)
over Green OA articles in the same journal (self-archived on the author's
website) was not just an artifact of having tested only one very high-profile
journal.",2007-01-22T02:14:10Z
Dynamic magnetic response of infinite arrays of ferromagnetic particles,"Recently developed techniques to find the eigenmodes of a ferromagnetic
particle of arbitrary shape, as well as the absorption in the presence of an
inhomogeneous radio-frequency field, are extended to treat infinite lattices of
such particles. The method is applied to analyze the results of recent FMR
experiments, and yields substantially good agreement between theory and
experiment.",2007-03-11T04:54:14Z
"Skew scattering due to intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in a
  two-dimensional electron gas","We present the generalization of the two-dimensional quantum scattering
formalism to systems with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using symmetry
considerations, we show that the differential scattering cross section depends
on the spin state of the incident electron, and skew scattering may arise even
for central spin-independent scattering potentials. The skew scattering effect
is demonstrated by exact results of a simple hard wall impurity model. The
magnitude of the effect for short-range impurities is estimated using the first
Born approximation. The exact formalism we present can serve as a foundation
for further theoretical investigations.",2007-03-20T14:28:08Z
Certification of bounds on expressions involving rounded operators,"Gappa uses interval arithmetic to certify bounds on mathematical expressions
that involve rounded as well as exact operators. Gappa generates a theorem with
its proof for each bound treated. The proof can be checked with a higher order
logic automatic proof checker, either Coq or HOL Light, and we have developed a
large companion library of verified facts for Coq dealing with the addition,
multiplication, division, and square root, in fixed- and floating-point
arithmetics. Gappa uses multiple-precision dyadic fractions for the endpoints
of intervals and performs forward error analysis on rounded operators when
necessary. When asked, Gappa reports the best bounds it is able to reach for a
given expression in a given context. This feature is used to quickly obtain
coarse bounds. It can also be used to identify where the set of facts and
automatic techniques implemented in Gappa becomes insufficient. Gappa handles
seamlessly additional properties expressed as interval properties or rewriting
rules in order to establish more intricate bounds. Recent work showed that
Gappa is perfectly suited to the proof of correctness of small pieces of
software. Proof obligations can be written by designers, produced by
third-party tools or obtained by overloading arithmetic operators.",2007-01-29T15:36:47Z
A class of relativistic stars with a linear equation of state,"By assuming a particular mass function we find new exact solutions to the
Einstein field equations with an anisotropic matter distribution. The solutions
are shown to be relevant for the description of compact stars. A distinguishing
feature of this class of solutions is that they admit a linear equation of
state which can be applied to strange stars with quark matter.",2007-02-08T08:16:33Z
"Enhanced magnetocaloric effect in frustrated magnetic molecules with
  icosahedral symmetry","We investigate the magnetocaloric properties of certain antiferromagnetic
spin systems that have already been or very likely can be synthesized as
magnetic molecules. It turns out that the special geometric frustration which
is present in antiferromagnets that consist of corner-sharing triangles leads
to an enhanced magnetocaloric effect with high cooling rates in the vicinity of
the saturation field. These findings are compared with the behavior of a simple
unfrustrated spin ring as well as with the properties of the icosahedron. To
our surprise, also for the icosahedron large cooling rates can be achieved but
due to a different kind of geometric frustration.",2007-03-19T09:21:51Z
"Visualizing the strain field in semiflexible polymer networks: strain
  fluctuations and nonlinear rheology of F-actin gels","We image semi-flexible polymer networks under shear at the micrometer scale.
By tracking embedded probe particles, we determine the local strain field, and
directly measure its uniformity, or degree of affineness, on scales of 2-100
micron. The degree of nonaffine strain depends on polymer length and crosslink
density, consistent with theoretical predictions. We also find a direct
correspondence between the uniformity of the microscale strain and the
nonlinear elasticity of the networks in the bulk.",2007-02-14T03:23:20Z
The dynamics of scalar-tensor cosmology from RS two-brane model,"We consider Randall-Sundrum two-brane cosmological model in the low energy
gradient expansion approximation by Kanno and Soda. It is a scalar-tensor
theory with a specific coupling function. We find a first integral of equations
for the A-brane metric and estimate constraints for the dark radiation term. We
perform a complementary analysis of the dynamics of the scalar field (radion)
using phase space methods and examine convergence towards the limit of general
relativity. We find that it is possible to stabilize the radion at a finite
value with suitable negative matter densities on the B-brane.",2007-01-08T09:25:43Z
"The multiplicity of the subgiant branch of Omega Centauri: Evidence for
  prolonged star formation","We present metallicity measurements based on GIRAFFE@VLT spectra of 80
subgiant-branch stars of the Galactic globular cluster Omega Centauri. The VLT
spectroscopic data are complemented by ACS/HST and WFI@ESO2.2m high-accuracy
color-magnitude diagrams. We have obtained the [Fe/H] abundance for each of the
80 target stars, and the abundances of C, N, Ca, Ti, and Ba for a subset of
them, by comparison with synthetic spectra. We show that stars with
[Fe/H]<-1.25 have a large magnitude spread on the flat part of the SGB. We
interpret this as empirical evidence for an age spread. We have identified four
distinct stellar groups within the SGB region: (i) an old, metal-poor group
([Fe/H]~-1.7); (ii) an old, metal-rich group ([Fe/H]~-1.1); (iii) a young (up
to 4--5 Gyr younger than the old component) metal-poor group ([Fe/H]~-1.7);
(iv) a young, intermediate-metallicity ([Fe/H]~-1.4) group, on average 1--2 Gyr
younger than the old metal-poor population, and with an age spread that we
cannot properly quantify with the present sample. In addition, a group of SGB
stars are spread between the intermediate-metallicity and metal-rich branches
of the SGB. The spread in age within each population establishes that the
progenitor of Omega Cen system must have had a composite nature.",2007-03-09T10:54:32Z
"Radio-frequency magnetic response of vortex lattices undergoing
  structural transformations","We report a clear anomaly in the rf response of a tunnel-diode resonator
measured in borocarbide crystals in dc fields along the $c-$axis. We associate
the anomaly in the dynamic magnetic susceptibility, $\chi$, with a structural
transition in the vortex lattice. $\chi$ is sensitive to the Campbell
penetration depth $\lambda_{C}$ of the rf perturbation into the mixed state.
$\lambda_{C}$ depends on the vortex lattice elastic moduli, which in turn
depend on the vortex lattice structure. The high-field transition line is
clearly mapped and shown to behave in agreement with theory.",2007-02-22T02:04:53Z
"Dirac-type equations in a gravitational field, with vector wave function","An analysis of the classical-quantum correspondence shows that it needs to
identify a preferred class of coordinate systems, which defines a torsionless
connection. One such class is that of the locally-geodesic systems,
corresponding to the Levi-Civita connection. Another class, thus another
connection, emerges if a preferred reference frame is available. From the
classical Hamiltonian that rules geodesic motion, the correspondence yields two
distinct Klein-Gordon equations and two distinct Dirac-type equations in a
general metric, depending on the connection used. Each of these two equations
is generally-covariant, transforms the wave function as a four-vector, and
differs from the Fock-Weyl gravitational Dirac equation (DFW equation). One
obeys the equivalence principle in an often-accepted sense, whereas the DFW
equation obeys that principle only in an extended sense.",2007-02-08T14:22:16Z
Diffusion in Modulated Media,"We study the motion of Brownian particle in modulated media in the strong
damping limit by using {\em toy model}, with special emphasis on the transition
from localise to diffusive behavior. By using model potential we have seen the
localised behavior when the number of minima of the potential is finite in the
asymptotic time limit. In the limit of infinite number of minima we have seen
the diffusive behavior.We calculate exactly the diffusion coefficient in
periodic field of force. We have also studied the transport in commensurate and
incommensurate media.",2007-02-05T08:07:43Z
"Rashba interferometers: Spin-dependent single and two-electron
  interference","Quantum transport in semiconductor nanostructures can be described
theoretically in terms of the propagation and scattering of electron
probability waves. Within this approach, elements of a phase-coherent electric
circuit play a role similar to quantum-optical devices that can be
characterised by scattering matrices. Electronic analogues of well-know optical
interferometers have been fabricated and used to study special features of
charge carriers in solids. We present results from our theoretical
investigation into the interplay between spin precession and quantum
interference in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer with spin-orbit
coupling of the Rashba type. Intriguing spin-dependent transport effects occur,
which can be the basis for novel spintronic devices such as a magnet-less
spin-controlled field-effect transistor and a variety of single-qubit gates.
Their functionality arises entirely from spin-dependent interference of each
single input electron with itself. We have also studied two-electron
interference effects for the spin-dependent Mach-Zehnder interferometer,
obtaining analytical expressions for its two-fermion-state scattering matrix.
Using this result, we consider ways to generate two-electron output states for
which the Rashba spin-subband quantum number and the output-arm index are
entangled. Combining spin-dependent interference in our proposed Mach-Zehnder
interferometer with a projective charge measurement at the output enables
entanglement generation. As our particular scheme involves tuneable spin
precession, electric-field control of entanglement production can be achieved.",2007-01-04T03:20:32Z
"Itinerant in-plane magnetic fluctuations and many-body correlations in
  Na$_x$CoO$_2$","Based on the {\it ab-initio} band structure for Na$_x$CoO$_2$ we derive the
single-electron energies and the effective tight-binding description for the
$t_{2g}$ bands using projection procedure. Due to the presence of the
next-nearest-neighbor hoppings a local minimum in the electronic dispersion
close to the $\Gamma$ point of the first Brillouin zone forms. Correspondingly,
in addition to a large Fermi surface an electron pocket close to the $\Gamma$
point emerges at high doping concentrations. The latter yields the new
scattering channel resulting in a peak structure of the itinerant magnetic
susceptibility at small momenta. This indicates dominant itinerant in-plane
ferromagnetic fluctuations above certain critical concentration $x_m$, in
agreement with neutron scattering data. Below $x_m$ the magnetic susceptibility
shows a tendency towards the antiferromagnetic fluctuations. We further analyze
the many-body effects on the electronic and magnetic excitations using various
approximations applicable for different $U/t$ ratio.",2007-01-30T19:09:42Z
"Controlling the order of wedge filling transitions: the role of line
  tension","We study filling phenomena in 3D wedge geometries paying particular attention
to the role played by a line tension associated with the wedge bottom. Our
study is based on transfer matrix analysis of an effective one dimensional
model of 3D filling which accounts for the breather-mode excitations of the
interfacial height. The transition may be first-order or continuous (critical)
depending on the strength of the line tension associated with the wedge bottom.
Exact results are reported for the interfacial properties near filling with
both short-ranged (contact) forces and also van der Waals interactions. For
sufficiently short-ranged forces we show the lines of critical and first-order
filling meet at a tricritical point. This contrasts with the case of dispersion
forces for which the lines meet at a critical end-point. Our transfer matrix
analysis is compared with generalized random-walk arguments based on a necklace
model and is shown to be a thermodynamically consistent description of
fluctuation effects at filling. Connections with the predictions of conformal
invariance for droplet shapes in wedges is also made.",2007-02-27T19:30:15Z
Density and Stability in Ultracold Dilute Boson-Fermion Mixtures,"We analyze in detail recent experiments on ultracold dilute 87Rb-40K mixtures
in Hamburg and in Florence within a mean-field theory. To this end we determine
how the stationary bosonic and fermionic density profiles in this mixture
depend in the Thomas-Fermi limit on the respective particle numbers.
Furthermore, we investigate how the observed stability of the Bose-Fermi
mixture with respect to collapse is crucially related to the value of the
interspecies s-wave scattering length.",2007-03-08T19:05:04Z
"Spin densities in parabolic quantum wires with Rashba spin-orbit
  interaction","Using canonical transformations we diagonalize approximately the Hamiltonian
of a gaussian wire with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. This proceedure allows
us to obtain the energy dispersion relations and the wavefunctions with good
accuracy, even in systems with relatively strong Rashba coupling. With these
eigenstates one can calculate the non-equilibrium spin densities induced by
applying bias voltages across the sample. We focus on the $z$-component of the
spin density, which is related to the spin Hall effect.",2007-01-23T18:13:49Z
Optimizing the SINR operating point of spatial networks,"This paper addresses the following question, which is of interest in the
design and deployment of a multiuser decentralized network. Given a total
system bandwidth of W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each
transmission, how many frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be
partitioned into to maximize the number of simultaneous transmissions in the
network? In an interference-limited ad-hoc network, dividing the available
spectrum results in two competing effects: on the positive side, it reduces the
number of users on each band and therefore decreases the interference level
which leads to an increased SINR, while on the negative side the SINR
requirement for each transmission is increased because the same information
rate must be achieved over a smaller bandwidth. Exploring this tradeoff between
bandwidth and SINR and determining the optimum value of N in terms of the
system parameters is the focus of the paper. Using stochastic geometry, we
analytically derive the optimal SINR threshold (which directly corresponds to
the optimal spectral efficiency) on this tradeoff curve and show that it is a
function of only the path loss exponent. Furthermore, the optimal SINR point
lies between the low-SINR (power-limited) and high-SINR (bandwidth-limited)
regimes. In order to operate at this optimal point, the number of frequency
bands (i.e., the reuse factor) should be increased until the threshold SINR,
which is an increasing function of the reuse factor, is equal to the optimal
value.",2007-02-05T17:08:42Z
"Use of Superparamagnetic Nanoparticle/Block Copolymer Electrostatic
  Complexes as Contrast Agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging","During the past years we have investigated the complexation between
nanocolloids and oppositely charged polymers. The nanocolloids examined were
ionic surfactant micelles and inorganic oxide nanoparticles. For the polymers,
we used homopolyelectrolytes and block copolymers with linear and comb
architectures. In general, the attractive interactions between oppositely
charged species are strong and as such, the simple mixing of solutions
containing dispersed constituents yield to a precipitation, or to a phase
separation. We have developed means to control the electrostatically-driven
attractions and to preserve the stability of the mixed solution. With these
approaches, we designed novel core-shell nanostructures, e.g. as those obtained
with polymers and iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles. In this
presentation, we show that electrostatic complexation can be used to tailor new
functionalized nanoparticles and we provide examples related to biomedical
applications in the domain of contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging.",2007-01-26T16:53:45Z
"Electromagnetic response and effective gauge theory of graphene in a
  magnetic field","The electromagnetic response of graphene in a magnetic field is studied, with
particular emphasis on the quantum features of its ground state (vacuum). The
graphene vacuum, unlike in conventional quantum Hall systems, is a dielectric
medium and carries an appreciable amount of electric and magnetic
susceptibilities. The dielectric effect grows rapidly with increasing filling
factor nu in such a way that reflects the 'relativistic' Landau-level
characteristics of graphene as well as its valley and spin degeneracy. A close
look into the dielectric function also reveals that the Coulomb interaction is
efficiently screened on the scale of the magnetic length, leading to a
prominent reduction of the exciton spectra in graphene. In addition, an
effective gauge theory of graphene is constructed out of the response. It is
pointed out thereby that the electric susceptibility is generally expressed as
a ratio of the Hall conductance to the Landau gap.",2007-02-28T10:26:30Z
"Torsional Strain of TaS$_3$ Whiskers on the Charge-Density Waves
  Depinning","We find that electric current $I$ exceeding the threshold value results in
torsion deformation of o-TaS$_3$ samples with one contact freely suspended. The
rotation angle, $\delta \phi$, of the free end achieves several degrees and
exhibits hysteresis as a function of $I$. The sign of $\delta \phi$ depends on
the $I$ polarity; a polar axis along the conducting chains (the {\it c}-axis)
is pointed out. We associate the effect with surface shear of the
charge-density waves (CDW) coupled to the crystal shear. The current-induced
torsional strain could be treated in terms of enormous piezoelectric
coefficients ($>10^{-4}$ cm/V) corresponding to shear. In essence, TaS$_3$
appears to be a ready torsional actuator based on the unique intrinsic property
of the CDW.",2007-02-07T14:28:29Z
"Magnetic focusing in normal-superconductor hybrid systems: a
  semiclassical analysis","We study a transverse electron-hole focusing effect in a
normal-superconductor system. The spectrum of the quasiparticles is calculated
both quantum mechanically and in semiclassical approximation, showing an
excellent agreement. A semiclassical conductance formula is derived which takes
into account the effect of electron-like as well as hole-like quasiparticles.
At low magnetic field the semiclassical conductance shows characteristic
oscillations due to the Andreev reflection, while at higher fields it goes to
zero. These findigs are in line with the results of previous quantum
calculations and with the expectations based on the classical dynamics of the
quasiparticles.",2007-03-20T19:42:09Z
Spreading in narrow channels,"We study a lattice model for the spreading of fluid films, which are a few
molecular layers thick, in narrow channels with inert lateral walls. We focus
on systems connected to two particle reservoirs at different chemical
potentials, considering an attractive substrate potential at the bottom,
confining side walls, and hard-core repulsive fluid-fluid interactions. Using
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations we find a diffusive behavior. The corresponding
diffusion coefficient depends on the density and is bounded from below by the
free one-dimensional diffusion coefficient, valid for an inert bottom wall.
These numerical results are rationalized within the corresponding continuum
limit.",2007-01-29T19:03:26Z
An algebraic approach to complexity of data stream computations,"We consider a basic problem in the general data streaming model, namely, to
estimate a vector $f \in \Z^n$ that is arbitrarily updated (i.e., incremented
or decremented) coordinate-wise. The estimate $\hat{f} \in \Z^n$ must satisfy
$\norm{\hat{f}-f}_{\infty}\le \epsilon\norm{f}_1 $, that is, $\forall i
~(\abs{\hat{f}_i - f_i} \le \epsilon \norm{f}_1)$. It is known to have
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ randomized space upper bound \cite{cm:jalgo},
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-1} \log (\epsilon n))$ space lower bound
\cite{bkmt:sirocco03} and deterministic space upper bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2})$ bits.\footnote{The $\tilde{O}$ and
$\tilde{\Omega}$ notations suppress poly-logarithmic factors in $n, \log
\epsilon^{-1}, \norm{f}_{\infty}$ and $\log \delta^{-1}$, where, $\delta$ is
the error probability (for randomized algorithm).} We show that any
deterministic algorithm for this problem requires space $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}
(\log \norm{f}_1))$ bits.",2007-01-02T18:12:52Z
"Persistent spin and charge currents and magnification effects in open
  ring conductors subject to Rashba coupling","We analyze the effect of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and of a local tunnel
barrier on the persistent spin and charge currents in a one-dimensional
conducting Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring symmetrically coupled to two leads. First,
as an important consequence of the spin-splitting, it is found that a
persistent spin current can be induced which is not simply proportional to the
charge current. Second, a magnification effect of the persistent spin current
is shown when one tunes the Fermi energy near the Fano-type antiresonances of
the total transmission coefficient governed by the tunnel barrier strength. As
an unambiguous signature of spin-orbit coupling we also show the possibility to
produce a persistent pure spin current at the interference zeros of the
transmittance. This widens the possibilities of employing mesoscopic conducting
rings in phase-coherent spintronics applications.",2007-01-18T17:01:23Z
Feedback controlled electromigration in four-terminal nano-junctions,"We have developed a fast, yet highly reproducible method to fabricate
metallic electrodes with nanometer separation using electromigration (EM). We
employ four-terminal instead of two-terminal devices in combination with an
analog feedback to maintain the voltage $U$ over the junction constant. After
the initialization phase ($U < 0.2V), during which the temperature $T$
increases by 80-150 degs C, EM sets in shrinking the wire locally. This quickly
leads to a transition from the diffusive to a quasi-ballistic regime ($0.2V < U
< 0.6V). At the end of this second regime, a gap forms (U > 0.6V). Remarkably,
controlled electromigration is still possible in the quasi-ballistic regime.",2007-03-25T15:21:43Z
"Phonon condensate in Landau-Pekar polarons and optical absorption due to
  their photoionization","Quantum-field theory methods are applied to consider the state of the
polarization field in a strongly-coupled large polaron (SCLP) and after its
photodissociation. It is demonstrated that in the adiabatic approximation the
polarization field in such a polaron coincides with the classical polarization
field considered in Landau-Pekar theory up to small quantum fluctuations.
However the state of this field after the polaron photodissociation is in
principle different from that obtained in theories of Pekar and Emin. This
results from the fact that as it is shown below the polarization field in a
SCLP is a spatially inhomogeneous phonon condensate. If the charge carrier is
removed from the SCLP on its photodissociation the phonon condensate decays
into phonons. As any Bose-condensate, the phonon condensate is a superposition
of states with different number of quanta where summands are phased up to small
quantum fluctuations. Therefore decay of the phonon condensate at the SCLP
photodissociation results in an essentially wider band in the absorption
spectrum than that predicted by theories with classical consideration of the
polarization: the position of maximum is 4.2Ep and the half-width 2.5Ep (3 Ep
and Ep in Emin theory, respectively), where Ep is the polaron binding energy.
The calculated band is in good conformity with mid-IR band in the optical
conductivity spectra of complex oxides. The predicted ratio (approximately 4)
of the maximum position of the band caused by the SCLP photoionization to the
frequency of maximum of the band caused by phototransitions into polaron
excited states calculated by other group is also in good conformity with
experiments.",2007-03-27T06:29:43Z
The Weak Energy Condition and the Expansion History of the Universe,"We examine flat models containing a dark matter component and an arbitrary
dark energy component, subject only to the constraint that the dark energy
satisfies the weak energy condition. We determine the constraints that these
conditions place on the evolution of the Hubble parameter with redshift, H(z),
and on the scaling of the coordinate distance with redshift, r(z).
Observational constraints on H(z) are used to derive an upper bound on the
current matter density. We demonstrate how the weak energy condition constrains
fitting functions for r(z).",2007-03-15T19:41:44Z
Slip avalanches in crystal plasticity: scaling of the avalanche cutoff,"Plastic deformation of crystals proceeds through a sequence of intermittent
slip avalanches with scale-free (power-law) size distribution. On macroscopic
scales, however, plastic flow is known to be smooth and homogeneous. In the
present letter we use a recently proposed continuum model of slip avalanches to
systematically investigate the nature of the cut-off which truncates scale-free
behavior at large avalanche sizes. The dependence of the cut-off on system
size, geometry, and driving mode, but also on intrinsic parameters such as the
strain hardening rate is established. Implications for the observability of
avalanche behavior in microscopic and macroscopic samples are discussed.",2007-01-27T17:57:43Z
"A length scale for the superconducting Nernst signal above T$_{c}$ in
  Nb$_{0.15}$Si$_{0.85}$","We present a study of the Nernst effect in amorphous superconducting thin
films of Nb$_{0.15}$Si$_{0.85}$. The field dependence of the Nernst coefficient
above T$_{c}$ displays two distinct regimes separated by a field scale set by
the Ginzburg-Landau correlation length. A single function $F(\xi)$, with the
correlation length as its unique argument set either by the zero-field
correlation length (in the low magnetic field limit) or by the magnetic length
(in the opposite limit), describes the Nernst coefficient. We conclude that the
Nernst signal observed on a wide temperature ($30 \times T_c$) and field ($4
\times B_{c2}$) range is exclusively generated by short-lived Cooper pairs.",2007-01-16T13:55:04Z
Multiquantum well spin oscillator,"A dc voltage biased II-VI semiconductor multiquantum well structure attached
to normal contacts exhibits self-sustained spin-polarized current oscillations
if one or more of its wells are doped with Mn. Without magnetic impurities, the
only configurations appearing in these structures are stationary. Analysis and
numerical solution of a nonlinear spin transport model yield the minimal number
of wells (four) and the ranges of doping density and spin splitting needed to
find oscillations.",2007-02-06T09:12:20Z
"Stability of Biaxial Nematic Phase for Systems with Variable Molecular
  Shape Anisotropy","We study the influence of fluctuations in molecular shape on the stability of
the biaxial nematic phase by generalizing the mean field model of Mulder and
Ruijgrok [Physica A {\bf 113}, 145 (1982)]. We limit ourselves to the case when
the molecular shape anisotropy, represented by the alignment tensor, is a
random variable of an annealed type. A prototype of such behavior can be found
in lyotropic systems - a mixture of potassium laurate, 1-decanol, and $D_2O$,
where distribution of the micellar shape adjusts to actual equilibrium
conditions. Further examples of materials with the biaxial nematic phase, where
molecular shape is subject to fluctuations, are thermotropic materials composed
of flexible trimeric- or tetrapod-like molecular units. Our calculations show
that the Gaussian equilibrium distribution of the variables describing
molecular shape (dispersion force) anisotropy gives rise to new classes of the
phase diagrams, absent in the original model. Depending on properties of the
shape fluctuations, the stability of the biaxial nematic phase can be either
enhanced or depressed, relative to the uniaxial nematic phases. In the former
case the splitting of the Landau point into two triple points with a direct
phase transition line from isotropic to biaxial phase is observed.",2007-03-28T14:16:11Z
Switchable coupling between charge and flux qubits,"We propose a hybrid quantum circuit with both charge and flux qubits
connected to a large Josephson junction that gives rise to an effective
inter-qubit coupling controlled by the external magnetic flux. This switchable
inter-qubit coupling can be used to transfer back and forth an arbitrary
superposition state between the charge qubit and the flux qubit working at the
optimal point. The proposed hybrid circuit provides a promising quantum memory
because the flux qubit at the optimal point can store the tranferred quantum
state for a relatively long time.",2007-03-01T06:55:12Z
"Variational wave functions, ground state and their overlap","An intrinsic measure of the quality of a variational wave function is given
by its overlap with the ground state of the system. We derive a general formula
to compute this overlap when quantum dynamics in imaginary time is accessible.
The overlap is simply related to the area under the $E(\tau)$ curve, i.e. the
energy as a function of imaginary time. This has important applications to, for
example, quantum Monte-Carlo algorithms where the overlap becomes as a simple
byproduct of routine simulations. As a result, we find that the practical
definition of a good variational wave function for quantum Monte-Carlo
simulations, {\it i.e.} fast convergence to the ground state, is equivalent to
a good overlap with the actual ground state of the system.",2007-02-28T22:03:55Z
The Final Fate of Binary Neutron Stars: What Happens After the Merger?,"The merger of two neutron stars usually produces a remnant with a mass
significantly above the single (nonrotating) neutron star maximum mass. In some
cases, the remnant will be stabilized against collapse by rapid, differential
rotation. MHD-driven angular momentum transport eventually leads to the
collapse of the remnant's core, resulting in a black hole surrounded by a
massive accretion torus. Here we present simulations of this process. The
plausibility of generating short duration gamma ray bursts through this
scenario is discussed.",2007-01-26T21:05:36Z
"Global phase diagram of the spin-1 antiferromagnet with uniaxial
  anisotropy on the kagome lattice","The phase diagram of the XXZ spin-1 quantum magnet on the kagome lattice is
studied for all cases where the $J_z$ coupling is antiferromagnetic. In the
zero magnetic field case, the six previously introduced phases, found using
various methods, are: the nondegenerate gapped photon phase which breaks no
space symmetry or spin symmetry; the six-fold degenerate phase with plaquette
order, which breaks both time reversal symmetry and translational symmetry; the
""superfluid"" (ferromagnetic) phase with an in-plane global U(1) symmetry
broken, when $J_{xy} < 0$; the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order when $J_{xy} >
0$; the nematic phase when $D < 0$ and large; and a phase with resonating
dimers on each hexagon. We obtain all of these phases and partial information
about their quantum phase transitions in a single framework by studying
condensation of defects in the six-fold plaquette phases. The transition
between nematic phase and the six-fold degenerate plaquette phase is
potentially an unconventional second-order critical point. In the case of a
nonzero magnetic field along $\hat{z}$, another ordered phase with translation
symmetry broken is opened up in the nematic phase. Due to the breaking of
time-reversal symmetry by the field, a supersolid phase emerges between the
six-fold plaquette order and the superfluid phase. This phase diagram might be
accessible in nickel compounds, BF$_4$ salts, or optical lattices of atoms with
three degenerate states on every site.",2007-01-25T21:54:54Z
Relaxation dynamics in strained fiber bundles,"Under an applied external load the global load-sharing fiber bundle model,
with individual fiber strength thresholds sampled randomly from a probability
distribution, will relax to an equilibrium state, or to complete bundle
breakdown. The relaxation can be viewed as taking place in a sequence of steps.
In the first step all fibers weaker than the applied stress fail. As the total
load is redistributed on the surviving fibers, a group of secondary fiber
failures occur, etc. For a bundle with a finite number of fibers the process
stops after a finite number of steps, $t$. By simulation and theoretical
estimates, it is determined how $t$ depends upon the stress, the initial load
per fiber, both for subcritical and supercritical stress. The two-sided
critical divergence is characterized by an exponent -1/2, independent of the
probability distribution of the fiber thresholds.",2007-01-29T11:12:45Z
Non-resonant microwave absorption studies on MgB2 thin film,"We report on the presence of weak links in the intermetallic superconductor
MgB2 from the non-resonant microwave absorption (NRMA) studies on the MgB2 thin
film. The strong low field signal, which is the characteristics of weak links
and the presence of hysteresis, which arises due to flux trapping, are
observed. The studies are carried out as a function of temperature, microwave
power, magnitude of modulation field and the range of field scan. Presence of
weak links is discussed in terms of increase in the oxygen content of grain
boundaries in the thin film and because of disorder effects arises due to the
aging of the sample. The pinning of flux lines with the changes in sweeping
direction leads to hysteresis in the NRMA signal and shows the contribution of
flux line motion in the power absorption.",2007-02-21T09:16:33Z
"Hybridized quadrupole-dipole exciton effects in $Cu_2O$ - Organic
  Heterostructure","In the present work we discuss resonant hybridization of the $1S$ quadrupole
Wannier-Mott exciton (WE) in a $Cu_2O$ quantum well with the Frenkel (FE)
dipole exciton in an adjacent layer of organic DCM2:CA:PA. The coupling between
excitons is due to interaction between the gradient of electric field induced
by DCM2 Frenkel exciton and the quadrupole moment of the $1S$ transition in the
cuprous oxide. The specific choice of the organic allows us to use the
mechanism of 'solid state solvation' to dynamically tune the WE and FE into
resonance during time $\approx 3.3 \: ns$ (comparable with the big life time of
the WE) of the 'slow' phase of the solvation. The quadrupole-dipole hybrid
utilizes the big oscillator strength of the FE along with the big lifetime of
the quadrupole exciton, unlike dipole-dipole hybrid exciton which utilizes big
oscillator strength of the FE and big radius of the dipole allowed WE. Due to
strong spatial dispersion and big mass of the quadrupole WE the hybridization
is not masked by the kinetic energy or the radiative broadening. The lower
branch of the hybrid dispersion exhibits a pronounced minimum and may be used
in applications. Also we investigate and report noticeable change in the
coupling due to a induced 'Stark effect' from the strong local electric field
of the FE. We investigated the fine energy structure of the quantum well
confined ortho and para excitons in cuprous oxide.",2007-03-10T23:54:36Z
"Theory of non-Fermi liquid near a diagonal electronic nematic state on a
  square lattice","We study effects of Fermi surface fluctuations on a single-particle life time
near the diagonal electronic nematic phase on a two-dimensional square lattice.
It has been shown that there exists a quantum critical point (QCP) between the
diagonal nematic and isotropic phases. We study the longitudinal fluctuations
of the order parameter near the critical point, where the singular forward
scattering leads to a non-Fermi liquid behavior over the whole Fermi surface
except along the k_x- and k_y-directions. We will also discuss the temperature
and chemical potential dependence of the single-particle decay rate.",2007-01-26T03:10:02Z
"Thermodynamics of a Heavy Ion-Irradiated Superconductor: the Zero-Field
  Transition","Specific heat measurements show that the introduction of amorphous columnar
defects considerably affects the transition from the normal to the
superconducting state in zero magnetic field. Experimental results are compared
to numerical simulations of the 3D XY model for both the pure system and the
system containing random columnar disorder. The numerics reproduce the salient
features of experiment, showing in particular that the specific heat peak
changes from cusp-like to smoothly rounded when columnar defects are added. By
considering the specific heat critical exponent alpha, we argue that such
behavior is consistent with recent numerical work [Vestergren et al., PRB 70,
054508 (2004)] showing that the introduction of columnar defects changes the
universality class of the transition.",2007-01-29T13:09:32Z
Saturation of Spin-Polarized Current in Nanometer Scale Aluminum Grains,"We describe measurements of spin-polarized tunnelling via discrete energy
levels of single Aluminum grains. In high resistance samples ($\sim G\Omega$),
the spin-polarized tunnelling current rapidly saturates as a function of the
bias voltage. This indicates that spin-polarized current is carried only via
the ground state and the few lowest in energy excited states of the grain. At
the saturation voltage, the spin-relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ of the highest
excited states is comparable to the electron tunnelling rate: $T_1^{-1}\approx
1.5\cdot 10^6 s^{-1}$ and $10^7s^{-1}$ in two samples. The ratio of $T_1^{-1}$
to the electron-phonon relaxation rate is in agreement with the Elliot-Yafet
scaling, an evidence that spin-relaxation in Al grains is governed by the
spin-orbit interaction.",2007-03-06T03:04:07Z
Non-photonic emission from gamma-ray bursts,"gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are likely sources of ultra-high energy, >10^{19} eV,
protons and high energy, >1 TeV, neutrinos. Large volume detectors of ultra
high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and high energy neutrinos, which are already
operating and are being expanded, may allow to test in the coming few years the
predictions of the GRB model for high energy proton and neutrino production.
Detection of the predicted signals will allow to identify the sources of UHECRs
and will provide a unique probe, which may allow to resolve open questions
related to the underlying physics of GRB models. Moreover, detection of GRB
neutrinos will allow to test for neutrino properties (e.g., flavor oscillations
for which tau's would be a unique signature, and coupling to gravity) with an
accuracy many orders of magnitude better than is currently possible.",2007-03-16T09:52:15Z
"Experimental Confirmation of the General Solution to the Multiple Phase
  Matching Problem","We recently described a general solution to the phase matching problem that
arises when one wishes to perform an arbitrary number of nonlinear optical
processes in a single medium [PRL 95 (2005) 133901]. Here we outline in detail
the implementation of the solution for a one dimensional photonic quasicrystal
which acts as a simultaneous frequency doubler for three independent optical
beams. We confirm this solution experimentally using an electric field poled
KTiOPO$_4$ crystal. In optimizing the device, we find - contrary to common
practice - that simple duty cycles of 100% and 0% may yield the highest
efficiencies, and show that our device is more efficient than a comparable
device based on periodic quasi-phase-matching.",2007-01-16T01:22:24Z
Hölder mean applied to Anderson localization,"The phase diagram of correlated, disordered electron systems is calculated
within dynamical mean-field theory using the H\""older mean local density of
states. A critical disorder strength is determined in the
Anderson-Falicov-Kimball model and the arithmetically and the geometrically
averages are found to be just particular means used respectively to detect or
not the Anderson localization. Correlated metal, Mott insulator and Anderson
insulator phases, as well as coexistence and crossover regimes are analyzed in
this new perspective.",2007-02-15T10:40:05Z
"Scaling of dissipation in megahertz-range micromechanical diamond
  oscillators","We report frequency and dissipation scaling laws for doubly-clamped diamond
resonators. The device lengths range from 10 microns to 19 microns
corresponding to frequency and quality-factor ranges of 17 MHz to 66 MHz and
600 to 2400 respectively. We find that the resonance frequency scales as 1/L^2
confirming the validity of the thin-beam approximation. The dominant
dissipation comes from two sources; for the shorter beams, clamping loss is the
dominant dissipation mechanism; while for the longer beams, surface losses
provide a significant source of dissipation. We compare and contrast these
mechanisms with other dissipation mechanisms to describe the data.",2007-03-02T22:18:25Z
"High-quality Spectrophotometry of the Planetary Nebula in the Fornax
  dSph","We present results of NTT spectroscopy of the one known planetary nebula (PN)
in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Fornax, a gas-deficient Local Group galaxy that
stopped its star formation activity a few hundred million years ago. We
detected the [OIII] 4363 line with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~22. For the
first time we detected the weak [SII] 6717,6731 lines (I(6717+6731) ~0.01
I(Hbeta)), determined the electron number density (Ne(SII) = 750 cm^-3), and
calculated O, N, Ne, Ar, S, Cl, Fe, He and C abundances. The abundance analysis
presented here is based on the direct calculation of the electron temperature
Te and yields an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.28+/-0.02. The analysis of
the O, Ne, Ar and S abundances shows that the original ISM oxygen abundance was
0.27+/-0.10 dex lower and that third-dredge-up self-pollution in oxygen took
place. The blue spectrum shows weak Wolf-Rayet features, and the progenitor
star is classified as a weak emission-line star. Four of the five PNe in dwarf
spheroidal galaxies are now known to show WR wind features. Overall, the
metallicity of the progenitor of the PN fits in well with stellar spectroscopic
abundances derived in previous studies as well as with the stellar
age-metallicity relation of Fornax.",2007-03-21T10:26:03Z
The maximum relative entropy principle,"We show that the naive application of the maximum entropy principle can yield
answers which depend on the level of description, i.e. the result is not
invariant under coarse-graining. We demonstrate that the correct approach, even
for discrete systems, requires maximization of the relative entropy with a
suitable reference probability, which in some instances can be deduced from the
symmetry properties of the dynamics. We present simple illustrations of this
crucial yet surprising feature in examples of classical and quantum statistical
mechanics, as well as in the field of ecology.",2007-03-23T15:09:51Z
Mean-field heat capacity of dilute magnetic alloys,"Using an asymptotic solution of the M-impurity thermodynamics of a dilute s-d
system, the impurity energy and impurity heat capacity DeltaC(T) are derived
for dilute magnetic alloys with spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 impurities. The
parameters which enter DeltaC are adjusted to fit experimental data on impurity
heat capacity of CuCr and LaCeAl_2. Agreement is satisfactory for CuCr, at
temperatures below 1K, and good for LaCeAl_2. The magnitude of theoretical
DeltaC(T) agrees with experiment and does not require scaling as in previous
s-d theories. Nonlinear dependence of DeltaC(T) on impurity concentration has
been accounted for the first time.",2007-03-06T10:07:33Z
A teleparallel representation of the Weyl Lagrangian,"The main result of the paper is a new representation of the Weyl Lagrangian
(massless Dirac Lagrangian). As the dynamical variable we use the coframe, i.e.
an orthonormal tetrad of covector fields. We write down a simple Lagrangian -
wedge product of axial torsion with a lightlike element of the coframe - and
show that variation of the resulting action with respect to the coframe
produces the Weyl equation. The advantage of our approach is that it does not
require the use of spinors, Pauli matrices or covariant differentiation. The
only geometric concepts we use are those of a metric, differential form, wedge
product and exterior derivative. Our result assigns a variational meaning to
the tetrad representation of the Weyl equation suggested by J.B.Griffiths and
R.A.Newing.",2007-02-03T18:38:39Z
Equilibrium spin currents in the Rashba medium,"We analyze equilibrium spin currents in a 2D electron gas with Rashba
spin-orbit interaction (Rashba medium). In a uniform Rashba medium these
currents are constant, and their ability to really transport spin is not
evident. But even weak inhomogeneity of the Rashba medium allows to reveal that
equilibrium spin currents can transport spin from areas where spin is produced
to areas where spin is absorbed.",2007-03-18T14:04:58Z
"Calculation of near-field scanning optical images of exciton, charged
  excition and multiexciton wavefunctions in self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum
  dots","The near-field scanning optical microscopy images of excitonic wavefunctions
in self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots are calculated using an empirical
pseudopotential method, followed by the configuration interaction (CI)
treatment of many-particle effects. We show the wavefunctions of neutral
exciton $X^0$ of different polarizations, and compare them to those of the
biexciton $XX$ and the charged excitons $X^+$ and $X^-$. We further show that
the exciton $X(P_h \to S_e)$ transition which is forbidden in the far-field
photoluminescence has comparable intensities to that of $X(S_h \to S_e)$
transition in the near-field photoluminescence .",2007-03-26T14:17:17Z
"Phonon condensate in Landau-Pekar polarons and optical absorption due to
  their photoionization","Quantum-field theory methods are applied to consider the state of the
polarization field in a strongly-coupled large polaron (SCLP) and after its
photodissociation. It is demonstrated that in the adiabatic approximation the
polarization field in such a polaron coincides with the classical polarization
field considered in Landau-Pekar theory up to small quantum fluctuations.
However the state of this field after the polaron photodissociation is in
principle different from that obtained in theories of Pekar and Emin. This
results from the fact that as it is shown below the polarization field in a
SCLP is a spatially inhomogeneous phonon condensate. If the charge carrier is
removed from the SCLP on its photodissociation the phonon condensate decays
into phonons. As any Bose-condensate, the phonon condensate is a superposition
of states with different number of quanta where summands are phased up to small
quantum fluctuations. Therefore decay of the phonon condensate at the SCLP
photodissociation results in an essentially wider band in the absorption
spectrum than that predicted by theories with classical consideration of the
polarization: the position of maximum is 4.2Ep and the half-width 2.5Ep (3 Ep
and Ep in Emin theory, respectively), where Ep is the polaron binding energy.
The calculated band is in good conformity with mid-IR band in the optical
conductivity spectra of complex oxides. The predicted ratio (approximately 4)
of the maximum position of the band caused by the SCLP photoionization to the
frequency of maximum of the band caused by phototransitions into polaron
excited states calculated by other group is also in good conformity with
experiments.",2007-03-27T06:29:43Z
Dynamic magnetic response of infinite arrays of ferromagnetic particles,"Recently developed techniques to find the eigenmodes of a ferromagnetic
particle of arbitrary shape, as well as the absorption in the presence of an
inhomogeneous radio-frequency field, are extended to treat infinite lattices of
such particles. The method is applied to analyze the results of recent FMR
experiments, and yields substantially good agreement between theory and
experiment.",2007-03-11T04:54:14Z
Bose-Einstein-condensed gases with arbitrary strong interactions,"Bose-condensed gases are considered with an effective interaction strength
varying in the whole range of the values between zero and infinity. The
consideration is based on the usage of a representative statistical ensemble
for Bose systems with broken global gauge symmetry. Practical calculations are
illustrated for a uniform Bose gas at zero temperature, employing a
self-consistent mean-field theory, which is both conserving and gapless.",2007-01-17T11:13:32Z
Theory of the Three Dimensional Quantum Hall Effect in Graphite,"We predict the existence of a three dimensional quantum Hall effect plateau
in a graphite crystal subject to a magnetic field. The plateau has a Hall
conductivity quantized at $\frac{4e^2}{\hbar} \frac{1}{c_0} $ with $c_0$ the
c-axis lattice constant. We analyze the three-dimensional Hofstadter problem of
a realistic tight-binding Hamiltonian for graphite, find the gaps in the
spectrum, and estimate the critical value of the magnetic field above which the
Hall plateau appears. When the Fermi level is in the bulk Landau gap, Hall
transport occurs through the appearance of chiral surface states. We estimate
the magnetic field necessary for the appearance of the three dimensional
quantum Hall Effect to be $15.4 $T for electron carriers and $7.0 $T for hole
carriers.",2007-01-18T09:07:08Z
"Advances in secular magnetohydrodynamics of stellar interiors dedicated
  to asteroseismic spatial missions","With the first light of COROT, the preparation of KEPLER and the future
helioseismology spatial projects such as GOLF-NG, a coherent picture of the
evolution of rotating stars from their birth to their death is needed. We
describe here the modelling of the macroscopic transport of angular momentum
and matter in stellar interiors that we have undertaken to reach this goal.
First, we recall in detail the dynamical processes that are driving these
mechanisms in rotating stars and the theoretical advances we have achieved.
Then, we present our new results of numerical simulations which allow us to
follow in 2D the secular hydrodynamics of rotating stars, assuming that
anisotropic turbulence enforces a shellular rotation law. Finally, we show how
this work is leading to a dynamical vision of the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram
with the support of asteroseismology and helioseismology, seismic observables
giving constraints on the modelling of the internal transport and mixing
processes. In conclusion, we present the different processes that should be
studied in the next future to improve our description of stellar radiation
zones.",2007-03-06T14:27:24Z

"Trapped fermionic clouds distorted from the trap shape due to many-body
  effects","We present a general approach for calculating densities and other local
quantities of trapped Fermi gases, when the cloud shape is distorted with
respect to the trap shape due to global energy considerations. Our approach
provides a consistent way to explore physics beyond the local density
approximation, if this is necessary due to the distortion. We illustrate this
by analyzing in detail experimentally observed distortions in an imbalanced
Fermi mixture in an elongated trap. In particular, we demonstrate in that case
dramatic deviations from ellipsoidal cloud shapes arising from the competition
between surface and bulk energies.",2007-01-18T22:14:54Z
"First-Principles Calculation of Be(0001) Thin Films: Quantum Size Effect
  and Adsorption of Atomic Hydrogen","We have carried out first-principles calculations of Be(0001) thin films to
study the oscillatory quantum size effects exhibited in the surface energy,
work function, and binding energy of the atomic hydrogen monolayer adsorption.
The prominent enhancement of the surface density of states at the Fermi level
makes Be(0001) thin films more metallic compared to the crystalline Be. As a
result, the calculated energetics of Be films and the properties of atomic H
adsorption onto Be(0001) surface are featured by a quantum oscillatory

"Anomalous thermodynamics of Coulomb interacting massless Dirac fermions
  in two spatial dimensions","It is argued that the specific heat of $N$ massless Dirac fermions in 2
spatial dimensions interacting with 1/r Coulomb interactions is suppressed
logarithmically relative to its non-interacting counterpart. The
(dimensionless) coefficient of the logarithm is calculated analytically in the
leading order in large $N$ expansion, but to all orders in $e^2N$, a procedure
which takes into account finite temperature screening. Experimental observation
of this effect is expected to occur in a single layer graphene embedded in a
dielectric medium. Its dependence on the dielectric constant is calculated
analytically.",2007-01-08T13:29:20Z
Incomplete pure dephasing of N-qubit entangled W states,"We consider qubits in a linear arrangement coupled to a bosonic field which
acts as a quantum heat bath and causes decoherence. By taking the spatial
separation of the qubits explicitly into account, the reduced qubit dynamics
acquires an additional non-Markovian element. We investigate the time evolution
of an entangled many-qubit W state, which for vanishing qubit separation
remains robust under pure dephasing. For finite separation, by contrast, the
dynamics is no longer decoherence-free. On the other hand, spatial noise
correlations may prevent a complete dephasing. While a standard Bloch-Redfield
master equation fails to describe this behavior even qualitatively, we propose
instead a widely applicable causal master equation. Here we employ it to
identify and characterize decoherence-poor subspaces. Consequences for quantum
error correction are discussed.",2007-03-02T19:37:35Z
"Type-II/III DCT/DST algorithms with reduced number of arithmetic
  operations","We present algorithms for the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete
sine transform (DST), of types II and III, that achieve a lower count of real
multiplications and additions than previously published algorithms, without
sacrificing numerical accuracy. Asymptotically, the operation count is reduced
from ~ 2N log_2 N to ~ (17/9) N log_2 N for a power-of-two transform size N.
Furthermore, we show that a further N multiplications may be saved by a certain
rescaling of the inputs or outputs, generalizing a well-known technique for N=8
by Arai et al. These results are derived by considering the DCT to be a special
case of a DFT of length 4N, with certain symmetries, and then pruning redundant
operations from a recent improved fast Fourier transform algorithm (based on a
recursive rescaling of the conjugate-pair split radix algorithm). The improved
algorithms for DCT-III, DST-II, and DST-III follow immediately from the
improved count for the DCT-II.",2007-03-30T00:53:48Z

tension is also estimated. The dissolution of the vacancy gas in solids is
shown to be responsible for the phases with composite incommensurate structures
in metals under high pressure and also for the low values of the elastic limit
and tensile strength of solids.",2007-01-08T14:53:23Z
"On the Complexity of the Numerically Definite Syllogistic and Related
  Fragments","In this paper, we determine the complexity of the satisfiability problem for
various logics obtained by adding numerical quantifiers, and other
constructions, to the traditional syllogistic. In addition, we demonstrate the
incompleteness of some recently proposed proof-systems for these logics.",2007-01-06T15:00:00Z
"Collapse Transition of Two-Dimensional Flexible and Semiflexible
  Polymers","The nature of the globule-coil transition of surface-confined polymers has
been an issue of debate. Here this 2D collapse transition is studied through a
partially directed lattice model. In the general case of polymers with positive
bending stiffness ($\Delta>0$), the collapse transition is {\em first-order};
it becomes {\em second-order} only in the limiting case of zero bending
stiffness ($\Delta\equiv 0$). These analytical results are confirmed by Monte
Carlo simulations. We also suggest some possible future experiments.",2007-01-18T08:42:11Z
Microscopic Current Dynamics in Nanoscale Junctions,"So far transport properties of nanoscale contacts have been mostly studied
within the static scattering approach. The electron dynamics and the transient
behavior of current flow, however, remain poorly understood. We present a
numerical study of microscopic current flow dynamics in nanoscale quantum point
contacts. We employ an approach that combines a microcanonical picture of
transport with time-dependent density-functional theory. We carry out atomic
and jellium model calculations to show that the time evolution of the current
flow exhibits several noteworthy features, such as nonlaminarity and edge flow.
We attribute these features to the interaction of the electron fluid with the
ionic lattice, to the existence of pressure gradients in the fluid, and to the
transient dynamical formation of surface charges at the nanocontact-electrode
interfaces. Our results suggest that quantum transport systems exhibit
hydrodynamical characteristics which resemble those of a classical liquid.",2007-01-26T18:25:04Z
Model Energy Landscapes of Low-Temperature Fluids: Dipolar Hard Spheres,"An analytical model of non-Gaussian energy landscape of low-temperature
fluids is developed based on the thermodynamics of the fluid of dipolar hard
spheres. The entire excitation profile of the liquid, from the high
temperatures to the point of ideal-glass transition, has been obtained from the
Monte Carlo simulations. The fluid of dipolar hard spheres loses stability when
reaching the point of ideal-glass transition transforming via a first-order
transition into a columnar liquid phase of dipolar chains locally arranged in a
body-centered tetragonal order.",2007-01-03T18:32:23Z
Dynamics of metal clusters in rare gas clusters,"We investigate the dynamics of Na clusters embedded in Ar matrices. We use a
hierarchical approach, accounting microscopically for the cluster's degrees of
freedom and more coarsely for the matrix. The dynamical polarizability of the
Ar atoms and the strong Pauli-repulsion exerted by the Ar-electrons are taken
into account. We discuss the impact of the matrix on the cluster gross
properties and on its optical response. We then consider a realistic case of
irradiation by a moderately intense laser and discuss the impact of the matrix
on the hindrance of the explosion, as well as a possible pump probe scenario
for analyzing dynamical responses.",2007-01-16T13:15:39Z
"Superfluid-Mott-Insulator Transition in a One-Dimensional Optical
  Lattice with Double-Well Potentials","We study the superfluid-Mott-insulator transition of ultracold bosonic atoms
in a one-dimensional optical lattice with a double-well confining trap using
the density-matrix renormalization group. At low density, the system behaves
similarly as two separated ones inside harmonic traps. At high density,
however, interesting features appear as the consequence of the quantum
tunneling between the two wells and the competition between the ""superfluid""
and Mott regions. They are characterized by a rich step-plateau structure in
the visibility and the satellite peaks in the momentum distribution function as
a function of the on-site repulsion. These novel properties shed light on the
understanding of the phase coherence between two coupled condensates and the
off-diagonal correlations between the two wells.",2007-01-13T01:31:32Z
"Vacuum fluctuations and the spin current in mesoscopic structures with
  collinear magnetic order","We show that in magnetic nanostructures with a homogeneous magnetic order,
the equilibrium spin current can be nonzero. For example, this is the case of a
wide magnetic ring with the magnetization along the ring axis. The physical
reason of this effect is a variation of the orientation of anisotropy axis
inducing a spin torque acting on the magnetic ions. The mechanism of the spin
current generation is related to the quantum vacuum fluctuations in the
magnetic system.",2007-02-07T10:30:39Z
Domain Directed Dialogs for Decision Processes,"The search for a standardized optimum way to communicate using natural
language dialog has involved a lot of research. However, due to the diversity
of communication domains, we think that this is extremely difficult to achieve
and different dialogue management techniques should be applied for different
situations. Our work presents the basis of a communication mechanism that
supports decision processes, is based on decision trees, and minimizes the
number of steps (turn-takes) in the dialogue. The initial dialog workflow is
automatically generated and the user's interaction with the system can also
change the decision tree and create new dialog paths with optimized cost. The
decision tree represents the chronological ordering of the actions (via the
parent-child relationship) and uses an object frame to represent the
information state (capturing the notion of context). This paper presents our
framework, the formalism for interaction and dialogue, and an evaluation of the
system compared to relevant dialog planning frameworks (i.e. finite state
diagrams, frame-based, information state and planning-based dialogue systems).",2007-03-15T00:08:50Z
"Lyapunov instability of rigid diatomic molecules in three dimensions - a
  simpler method","We present a new method to calculate Lyapunov exponents of rigid diatomic
molecules in three dimensions (12N dimensional phase space). The spectra of
Lyapunov exponents are obtained for 32 rigid diatomic molecules interacting
through the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson(WCA) potential for various bond length and
densities, and compared with those in Y.-H. Shin et al. [Phys. Rev. E 64,
041106 (2001)]. Our algorithm is easy to implement and total CPU time is
relatively inexpensive.",2007-03-11T16:17:59Z
Iron melting curve with a tricritical point,"Solidification as a first order phase transition is described in the Landau
theory by the same equation as tricritical phenomena. Here, the solidification
or melting temperature against pressure curve is modelled to end at a
tricritical point. The model gives the phase transition temperature's
dependence on pressure up to the quadratic term with a definite expression for
the coefficients. This formula is expected to be generally valid for pure
materials having melting curves with dT/dP approaching zero at very high P.
Excellent experimental agreement is obtained for iron, the material having the
most high pressure data which rather accurately determines the value of the
coefficient defining the curvature. The geophysically interesting iron
solidification temperatures at the Earth's core pressures are obtained. In
addition, the general formulae for entropy change, latent heat and volume
contraction in solidification are found and calculated for iron as functions of
pressure and temperature.",2007-01-12T16:52:23Z
Phase Transitions from Saddles of the Potential Energy Landscape,"The relation between saddle points of the potential of a classical
many-particle system and the analyticity properties of its thermodynamic
functions is studied. For finite systems, each saddle point is found to cause a
nonanalyticity in the Boltzmann entropy, and the functional form of this
nonanalytic term is derived. For large systems, the order of the nonanalytic
term increases unboundedly, leading to an increasing differentiability of the
entropy. Analyzing the contribution of the saddle points to the density of
states in the thermodynamic limit, our results provide an explanation of how,
and under which circumstances, saddle points of the potential energy landscape
may (or may not) be at the origin of a phase transition in the thermodynamic
limit. As an application, the puzzling observations by Risau-Gusman et al. on
topological signatures of the spherical model are elucidated.",2007-03-14T15:31:34Z
Observing Spin Polarization of Individual Magnetic Adatoms,"We have used spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy to observe the
spin-polarization state of individual Fe and Cr atoms adsorbed onto Co
nanoislands. Both of these magnetic adatoms exhibit stationary out-of-plane
spin-polarization due to their direct exchange interaction with the substrate,
but the sign of the exchange coupling between electron states of the adatom and
the surface state of the Co island is opposite for the two: Fe adatoms exhibit
parallel spin-polarization to the Co surface state while Cr adatoms exhibit
antiparallel spin-polarization. First-principles calculations predict
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic alignment of the spin moment for individual
Fe and Cr adatoms on a Co film, respectively, implying negative
spin-polarization for Fe and Cr adatoms over the energy range of the Co surface
state.",2007-03-28T05:02:51Z
Brane world cosmology with Gauss-Bonnet and induced gravity terms,"In this thesis we investigate certain cosmological brane world models of the
Randall-Sundrum type. The models are motivated by string theory but we focus on
the phenomenology of the cosmology. Two models of specific interest are the
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP, induced-gravity) model, where the brane action is
modified, and the Gauss-Bonnet model where the bulk action is modified. Both of
these modifications maybe motivated by string theory. We provide a brief review
of Randall-Sundrum models and then consider the Kaluza-Klein modes on Minkowski
and de Sitter branes, in both the two and one brane cases. The spectrum
obtained for the de Sitter branes is a new result. We then consider a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker brane in order to investigate the cosmological
dynamics on the brane. We present a brief discussion of the DGP and
Gauss-Bonnet brane worlds. We then investigate the Gauss-Bonnet-Induced-Gravity
(GBIG) model where the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) bulk term is combined with the
induced-gravity (IG) brane term of the DGP model. We present a thorough
investigation of cosmological dynamics, in particular focusing on GBIG models
that behave like self-accelerating DGP models at late times but at early times
show the remarkable feature of a finite-temperature Big Bang. We also discuss
the constraints from observations, including ages and Big Bang nucleosynthesis.",2007-01-15T22:04:20Z
The nebula around the post-AGB star 89 Her,"We aim to study the structure of the nebula around the post-AGB, binary star
89 Her. The presence of a rotating disk around this star had been proposed but
not been yet confirmed by observations. We present high-resolution PdBI maps of
CO J=2-1 and 1-0. Properties of the nebula are directly derived from the data
and model fitting. We also present N-band interferometric data on the extent of
the hot dust emission, obtained with the VLTI. Two nebular components are
found: (a) an extended hour-glass-like structure, with expansion velocities of
about 7 km/s and a total mass ~ 3 10$^{-3}$ Mo, and (b) an unresolved very
compact component, smaller than ~ 0.4"" and with a low total velocity dispersion
of ~ 5 km/s. We cannot determine the velocity field in the compact component,
but we argue that it can hardly be in expansion, since his would require too
recent and too sudden an ejection of mass. On the other hand, assuming that
this component is a keplerian disk, we derive disk properties that are
compatible with expectations for such a structure; in particular, the size of
the rotating gas disk should be very similar to the extent of the hot dust
component from our VLTI data. Assuming that the equator of the extended nebula
coincides with the binary orbital plane, we provide new results on the
companion star mass and orbit.",2007-03-28T11:00:55Z
CVD of CrO2: towards a lower temperature deposition process,"We report on the synthesis of highly oriented a-axis CrO2 films onto (0001)
sapphire by atmospheric pressure CVD from CrO3 precursor, at growth
temperatures down to 330 degree Celsius, i.e. close to 70 degrees lower than in
published data for the same chemical system. The films keep the high quality
magnetic behaviour as those deposited at higher temperature, which can be
looked as a promising result in view of their use with thermally sensitive
materials, e.g. narrow band gap semiconductors.",2007-01-26T20:25:27Z
"Quantum rearrangement and self-consistent BCS-BEC crossover
  thermodynamics","Based on previous works, analytical calculational procedures for dealing with
the strongly interacting fermions ground state are further developed through a
medium dependent potential in terms of the Bethe-Peierls contact interaction
model. The methods are exact in the unitary limit regime and they lead to the
self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree ones. The single particle
energy spectrum rearrangement effects on the thermodynamics due to the
Hugenholtz-van Hove theorem constraint are addressed. These effects lead to an
additional instantaneous correlation potential contribution to the system
physical chemical potential and pressure, i.e., equation of state, which
enforces the classical thermodynamic consistency. The Dyson-Schwinger equations
represent implicitly the various Bethe-Goldstone expansion ones. In a
thermodynamically self-consistent way, the universal dimensionless factor is
analytically calculated to be $\xi=\049$, which defines the ratio of the
unitary fermions energy density to that of the ideal non-interacting ones at
T=0.",2007-02-24T14:20:32Z
"Experimental growth law for bubbles in a ""wet"" 3D liquid foam","We used X-ray tomography to characterize the geometry of all bubbles in a
liquid foam of average liquid fraction $\phi_l\approx 17 %$ and to follow their
evolution, measuring the normalized growth rate
$\mathcal{G}=V^{-{1/3}}\frac{dV} {dt}$ for 7000 bubbles. While $\mathcal{G}$
does not depend only on the number of faces of a bubble, its average over
$f-$faced bubbles scales as $G_f\sim f-f_0$ for large $f$s at all times. We
discuss the dispersion of $\mathcal{G}$ and the influence of $V$ on
$\mathcal{G}$.",2007-02-28T16:10:07Z
Pre-main sequence stars in open clusters. I. The DAY-I catalogue,"We present the project we are carrying out at present, the search for and
characterisation of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars among the members of Galactic
young clusters. The observations of 10 southern clusters, nine of them located
in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm of the Milky Way are presented. We aim at
listing candidate PMS member stars in young clusters. The catalogued stars will
serve as a basis for future spectroscopic studies of individual objects to
determine the properties of stellar formation in the last phases before the
main sequence stage. Properties such as the presence of residual envelopes or
disks, age spread among PMS members, and the possible presence of several
episodes of star formation in the clusters, are to be addressed.
  Multicolour photometry in the UBVRcIc system has been obtained for 10
southern young clusters in the fourth Galactic quadrant, located between
Galactic longitudes l=238 and l=310. For six clusters in the sample, the
observations presented here provide the first published study based on CCD
photometry. A quantitative comparison is performed with post-MS isochrones, and
PMS isochrones from three different evolutionary models are used in the
photometric membership analysis for possible PMS stars. The observations
produce photometric indices in the Johnson-Cousins photometric systems for a
total of 26962 stars. Matching with the 2MASS data base provides astrometric
calibration for all stars, and JHK 2MASS indices for 60 per cent of them.
Post-MS cluster ages range from 4 to 60 Myr, whereas the photometric membership
analysis assigns PMS membership to a total of 842 stars, covering an age range
between 1 and 10 Myr. A catalogue, named DAY-I, with the information on the PMS
candidate members has been ellaborated.",2007-03-14T16:30:43Z
"Role of the trigonal warping on the minimal conductivity of bilayer
  graphene","Using a reformulated Kubo formula we calculate the zero-energy minimal
conductivity of bilayer graphene taking into account the small but finite
trigonal warping. We find that the conductivity is independent of the strength
of the trigonal warping and it is three times as large as that without trigonal
warping, and six times larger than that in single layer graphene. Although the
trigonal warping of the dispersion relation around the valleys in the Brillouin
zone is effective only for low energy excitations, our result shows that its
role cannot be neglected in the zero-energy minimal conductivity.",2007-03-30T17:41:37Z
Guessing based on length functions,"A guessing wiretapper's performance on a Shannon cipher system is analyzed
for a source with memory. Close relationships between guessing functions and
length functions are first established. Subsequently, asymptotically optimal
encryption and attack strategies are identified and their performances analyzed
for sources with memory. The performance metrics are exponents of guessing
moments and probability of large deviations. The metrics are then characterized
for unifilar sources. Universal asymptotically optimal encryption and attack
strategies are also identified for unifilar sources. Guessing in the increasing
order of Lempel-Ziv coding lengths is proposed for finite-state sources, and
shown to be asymptotically optimal. Finally, competitive optimality properties
of guessing in the increasing order of description lengths and Lempel-Ziv
coding lengths are demonstrated.",2007-02-20T09:12:11Z
Magnetic properties of FeCo nanoclusters on Cu(100),"We present ab-initio calculations of the magnetic moments and magnetic
anisotropy energies of small FeCo clusters of varying composition on top of a
Cu(100) substrate. Three different cluster layouts have been considered, namely
2x2, 3x3 and cross-like pentamer clusters. The ratio of Co atoms with respect
to the total number in a chosen cluster (``concentration'') was varied and all
possible arrangements of the atomic species were taken into account.
Calculations have been performed fully relativistically using the embedded
cluster technique in conjunction with the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker
method and the magnetocrysergy depend on the position they occupy in a
particular cluster and on the type and the number of nearest-neighbors. The MAE
for the 2x2 and 3x3 clusters varies with respect to the ``concentration'' of Co
atoms in the same manner as the corresponding monolayer case, whereas the
pentamer clusters show a slightly different behavior. Furthermore, for the
clusters with an easy axis along a direction in the surface plane, the MAE
shows a significant angular dependence.",2007-01-18T13:59:41Z
"Scattering by Atomic Spins and Magnetoresistance in Dilute Magnetic
  Semiconductors","We studied electrical transport in magnetic semiconductors, which is
determined by scattering of free carriers off localized magnetic moments. We
calculated the scattering time and the mobility of the majority and
minority-spin carriers with both the effects of thermal spin fluctuations and
of spatial disorder of magnetic atoms taken into account. These are responsible
for the magnetic-field dependence of electrical resistivity. Namely, the
application of the external magnetic field suppresses the thermodynamic spin
fluctuations thus promoting negative magnetoresistance. Simultaneously,
scattering off the built-in spatial fluctuations of the atomic spin
concentrations may increase with the magnetic field. The latter effect is due
to the growth of the magnitude of random local Zeeman splittings with the
magnetic field. It promotes positive magnetoresistance. We discuss the role of
the above effects on magnetoresistance of non-degenerate semiconductors where
magnetic impurities are electrically active or neutral.",2007-02-20T19:44:17Z
From density-matrix renormalization group to matrix product states,"In this paper we give an introduction to the numerical density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, from the perspective of the more
general matrix product state (MPS) formulation. We cover in detail the
differences between the original DMRG formulation and the MPS approach,
demonstrating the additional flexibility that arises from constructing both the
wavefunction and the Hamiltonian in MPS form. We also show how to make use of
global symmetries, for both the Abelian and non-Abelian cases.",2007-01-18T14:02:08Z
"Distributed Power Allocation with Rate Constraints in Gaussian Parallel
  Interference Channels","This paper considers the minimization of transmit power in Gaussian parallel
interference channels, subject to a rate constraint for each user. To derive
decentralized solutions that do not require any cooperation among the users, we
formulate this power control problem as a (generalized) Nash equilibrium game.
We obtain sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence and nonemptiness
of the solution set to our problem. Then, to compute the solutions of the game,
we propose two distributed algorithms based on the single user waterfilling
solution: The \emph{sequential} and the \emph{simultaneous} iterative
waterfilling algorithms, wherein the users update their own strategies
sequentially and simultaneously, respectively. We derive a unified set of
sufficient conditions that guarantee the uniqueness of the solution and global
convergence of both algorithms. Our results are applicable to all practical
distributed multipoint-to-multipoint interference systems, either wired or
wireless, where a quality of service in terms of information rate must be
guaranteed for each link.",2007-02-28T07:33:05Z
"Discrete Memoryless Interference and Broadcast Channels with
  Confidential Messages: Secrecy Rate Regions","We study information-theoretic security for discrete memoryless interference
and broadcast channels with independent confidential messages sent to two
receivers. Confidential messages are transmitted to their respective receivers
with information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each receiver is kept in total
ignorance with respect to the message intended for the other receiver. The
secrecy level is measured by the equivocation rate at the eavesdropping
receiver. In this paper, we present inner and outer bounds on secrecy capacity
regions for these two communication systems. The derived outer bounds have an
identical mutual information expression that applies to both channel models.
The difference is in the input distributions over which the expression is
optimized. The inner bound rate regions are achieved by random binning
techniques. For the broadcast channel, a double-binning coding scheme allows
for both joint encoding and preserving of confidentiality. Furthermore, we show
that, for a special case of the interference channel, referred to as the switch
channel, the two bound bounds meet. Finally, we describe several transmission
schemes for Gaussian interference channels and derive their achievable rate
regions while ensuring mutual information-theoretic secrecy. An encoding scheme
in which transmitters dedicate some of their power to create artificial noise
is proposed and shown to outperform both time-sharing and simple multiplexed
transmission of the confidential messages.",2007-02-17T21:02:37Z
New Consideration on Composed Nonextensive Magnetic Systems,"In this paper a composed A+B magnetic system, with spins J_A=2 and J_B=3/2,
is considered within the mean-field approximation, in the framework of Tsallis
nonextensive statistics. Our motivation is twofold: (1) to approach the
existing experimental data of manganese oxides (manganites), where Mn^{3+} and
Mn^{4+} form two magnetic sublattices, and (2) to investigate the structure of
nonextensive density matrices of composed systems. By imposing that
thermodynamic quantities, such as the magnetization of sublattices A and B,
must be invariant weather the calculation is taken over the total Hilbert space
or over partial subspaces, we found that the expression for the nonextensive
entropy must be adapted. Our argument is supported by calculation of
sublattices magnetization M_A and M_B, internal energy, U_A and U_B, and
magnetic specific heat, CA and CB. It is shown that only with the modified
entropy the two methods of calculation agree to each other. Internal energy and
magnetization are additive, but no clear relationship was found between S_A,
S_B and the total entropy S_{A+B} for q \neq 1. It is shown that the reason for
the failure of the standard way of calculation is the assumption of statistical
independence between the two subsystems, which however does not affect the
density matrix in the full Hilbert space.",2007-01-22T18:36:14Z
"An insight into the electronic structure of graphene: from monolayer to
  multi-layer","In this paper, we analytically investigate the electronic structure of Bernal
stacking (AB stacking) graphene evolving from monolayer (a zero-gap
semiconductor with a linear Dirac-like spectrum around the Fermi energy) to
multi-layer (semi-metal bulk graphite). We firstly derive a real space
analytical expression for the free Green's function (propagator) of multi-layer
graphene based on the effective-mass approximation. The simulation results
exhibit highly spatial anisotropy with three-fold rotational symmetry. By
combining with the STM measurement of d2I/dV2 (the second derivative of
current), we also provide a clear high-throughput and non-destructive method to
identify graphene layers. Such a method is lacking in the emerging graphene
research.",2007-03-15T18:16:40Z
"Spitzer Space Telescope Observations of the Magnetic Cataclysmic
  Variable AE Aqr","The magnetic cataclysmic variable AE Aquarii hosts a rapidly rotating white
dwarf which is thought to expel most of the material streaming onto it.
Observations of AE Aqr have been obtained in the wavelength range of 5 - 70
microns with the IRS, IRAC, and MIPS instruments on board the Spitzer Space
Telescope. The spectral energy distribution reveals a significant excess above
the K4V spectrum of the donor star with the flux increasing with wavelength
above 12.5 microns. Superposed on the energy distribution are several hydrogen
emission lines, identified as Pf alpha and Hu alpha, beta, gamma. The infrared
spectrum above 12.5 microns can be interpreted as synchrotron emission from
electrons accelerated to a power-law distribution dN=E^{-2.4}dE in expanding
clouds with an initial evolution timescale in seconds. However, too many
components must then be superposed to explain satisfactorily both the
mid-infrared continuum and the observed radio variability. Thermal emission
from cold circumbinary material can contribute, but it requires a disk
temperature profile intermediate between that produced by local viscous
dissipation in the disk and that characteristic of a passively irradiated disk.
Future high-time resolution observations spanning the optical to radio regime
could shed light on the acceleration process and the subsequent particle
evolution.",2007-03-19T12:20:19Z
Information and maximum power in a feedback controlled Brownian ratchet,"Closed-loop or feedback controlled ratchets are Brownian motors that operate
using information about the state of the system. For these ratchets, we compute
the power output and we investigate its relation with the information used in
the feedback control. We get analytical expressions for one-particle and
few-particle flashing ratchets, and we find that the maximum power output has
an upper bound proportional to the information. In addition, we show that the
increase of the power output that results from changing the optimal open-loop
ratchet to a closed-loop ratchet also has an upper bound that is linear in the
information.",2007-03-28T14:28:13Z
"Mean field thermodynamics of a spin-polarized spherically trapped Fermi
  gas at unitarity","We calculate the mean-field thermodynamics of a spherically trapped Fermi gas
with unequal spin populations in the unitarity limit, comparing results from
the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and the local density approximation. We
follow the usual mean-field decoupling in deriving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations and set up an efficient and accurate method for solving these
equations. In the local density approximation we consider locally homogeneous
solutions, with a slowly varying order parameter. With a large particle number
these two approximation schemes give rise to essentially the same results for
various thermodynamic quantities, including the density profiles. This
excellent agreement strongly indicates that the small oscillation of order
parameters near the edge of trap, sometimes interpreted as spatially
inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states in previous studies of
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, is a finite size effect. We find that a bimodal
structure emerges in the density profile of the minority spin state at finite
temperature, as observed in experiments. The superfluid transition temperature
as a function of the population imbalance is determined, and is shown to be
consistent with recent experimental measurements. The temperature dependence of
the equation of state is discussed.",2007-02-08T07:44:07Z
"Collective Modes and Stability of Bose-Fermi Mixtures with a BCS-BEC
  Crossover","We investigate an ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture with a Feshbach resonance
between two hyperfine states of fermions. Using a functional integral method,
we calculate collective modes associated with fermion-pairs and bosons in a
superfluid phase. We derive a stability condition of the mixtures, which is
valid in the entire region of the BCS-BEC crossover. This stability condition,
which smoothly connects the well-known results obtained in both the BCS and BEC
limits, shows that sufficiently strong FB interactions destabilize the
mixtures. In order to investigate the consequence of this instability, we study
the ground state energy of both the uniformly mixed and the phase-separated
states. We find that the FB repulsion induces a phase separation, whereas the
FB attraction should cause a collapse of the mixture. The possibilities for the
experimental observation of such instabilities are also discussed.",2007-02-05T09:04:34Z
Interedge coherent line junctions in Quantum Hall systems,"In this paper we address some of the properties of quantum Hall line
junctions (QHLJ) that occur near barriers separating electron gases on quantum
Hall plateaus.In narrow barriers where electron tunneling can occur, the low
energy physics of the QHLJ is described by the quantum sine-Gordon model. We
propose procedures to study a sort of properties of these systems in relation
with recent experimental studies of Kang {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 403}, 59
(2000). We propose experimental ways of measuring the values of the
dimensionless coupling constant characteristic for the Sine-Gordon model as
well as its Fermi velocity. When the bulk filling of the 2DEG subsystems is
$\nu \sim 2$, these systems can be good candidates for observation of
spin-incoherent LL behavior.",2007-01-10T20:52:42Z
Universal thermodynamics of strongly interacting Fermi gases,"Strongly interacting Fermi gases are of great current interest. Not only are
fermions the most common particles in the universe, but they are also thought
to have a universal thermodynamic behavior for strong interactions
\cite{heiselberg,carlson,ho}. Recent experiments on ultra-cold Fermi gases
provide an unprecedented opportunity to test universality in the laboratory
\cite{hara,thomas,partridge,stewart,luo}. In principle this allows - for
example - the interior properties of hot, dense neutron stars to be
investigated on earth. Here we carry out a detailed test of this prediction. We
analyze results from three ultra-cold fermion experiments involving two
completely distinct atomic species in different kinds of atomic trap
environments \cite{partridge,stewart,luo}. The data is compared with the
predictions of a recent strong interaction theory \cite{hldepl,hldpra}.
Excellent agreement is obtained, with no adjustable parameters. By
extrapolating to zero temperature, we show that the experimental measurements
yield a many-body parameter} $\mathbf{\beta\simeq-0.59\pm.07}$,

"A theoretical model for single molecule incoherent scanning tunneling
  spectroscopy","Single molecule scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), with dephasing due to
elastic and inelastic scattering, is of some current interest. Motivated by
this, we report an extended Huckel theory (EHT) based mean-field
Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) transport model with electron-phonon
scattering treated within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA).
Furthermore, a procedure based on EHT basis set modification is described. We
use this model to study the effect of the temperature dependent dephasing, due
to low lying modes in far-infrared range for which hw<<kT, on the resonant

What is a crystal?,"Almost 25 years have passed since Shechtman discovered quasicrystals, and 15
years since the Commission on Aperiodic Crystals of the International Union of
Crystallography put forth a provisional definition of the term crystal to mean
``any solid having an essentially discrete diffraction diagram.'' Have we
learned enough about crystallinity in the last 25 years, or do we need more
time to explore additional physical systems? There is much confusion and
contradiction in the literature in using the term crystal. Are we ready now to
propose a permanent definition for crystal to be used by all? I argue that time
has come to put a sense of order in all the confusion.",2007-01-02T05:00:33Z
"Elastic constants and high-pressure structural transitions in lanthanum
  monochalcogenides from experiment and theory","The high-pressure structural behavior of lanthanum monochalcogenides is
investigated by theory and experiment. Theory comprises density functional
calculations of LaS, LaSe and LaTe with the general gradient approximation for
exchange and correlation effects, as implemented within the full-potential
linear muffin-tin orbital method. The experimental studies consist of
high-pressure angle dispersive x-ray diffraction investigations of LaS and LaSe
up to a maximum pressure of 41 GPa. A structural phase transition from the NaCl
type to CsCl type crystal structure is found to occur in all cases. The
experimental transition pressures are 27-28 GPa and 19 GPa, for LaS and LaSe,
respectively, while the calculated transition pressures are 29 GPa, 21 GPa and
10 GPa for LaS, LaSe and LaTe, respectively. The calculated ground state
properties such as equilibrium lattice constant, bulk modulus and its pressure
derivative, and Debye temperatures are in good agreement with experimental
results. Elastic constants are predicted from the calculations.",2007-01-31T13:17:22Z
The fundamental solution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation,"We deal with the Cauchy problem for the space-time fractional diffusion-wave
equation, which is obtained from the standard diffusion equation by replacing
the second-order space derivative with a Riesz-Feller derivative of order alpha
in (0,2] and skewness theta, and the first-order time derivative with a Caputo
derivative of order beta in (0,2]. The fundamental solution is investigated
with respect to its scaling and similarity properties, starting from its
Fourier-Laplace representation. By using the Mellin transform, we provide a
general representation of the solution in terms of Mellin-Barnes integrals in
the complex plane, which allows us to extend the probability interpretation
known for the standard diffusion equation to suitable ranges of the relevant
parameters alpha and beta. We derive explicit formulae (convergent series and
asymptotic expansions), which enable us to plot the corresponding spatial
probability densities.",2007-02-18T11:23:31Z
"Density matrix theory of transport and gain in quantum cascade lasers in
  a magnetic field","A density matrix theory of electron transport and optical gain in quantum
cascade lasers in an external magnetic field is formulated. Starting from the
general quantum kinetic treatment, we describe the intra- and inter-period
electron dynamics at the non-Markovian, Markovian and Boltzmann approximation
levels. Interactions of electrons with longitudinal optical phonons and
classical light field are included in the present description. The
non-Markovian calculation for a prototype structure reveals significantly
different gain spectra in terms of linewidth and additional polaronic features
in comparison to the Markovian and Boltzmann ones. Despite strongly opposed
interpretations of the origin of the transport processes in the non-Markovian
or Markovian and the Boltzmann approaches, they yield comparable values of the
current densities.",2007-02-22T00:13:51Z
"MRI Investigations of Particle Motion within a Three-Dimensional
  Vibro-Fluidized Granular Bed","The unique ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide spatial and
temporal information from optically opaque systems, in three dimensions, make
it an ideal tool to study the internal motion of rapid granular flows. This
paper will focus on the use of ultra-fast velocity compensated MRI measurements
to study particle velocity and density distributions in a granular gas,
produced by vibrating vertically a bed of mustard seeds at 40 Hz. Specifically,
a velocity compensated, double spin-echo, triggered, one-dimensional MRI
profiling pulse sequence was developed. This gives an MRI temporal resolution
of approximately 2 ms and also minimises MRI velocity artefacts. 12 phase
measurements per vibration cycle were used. The data can be used to extract
values of the mustard seed average velocity and velocity propagators
(probability distributions functions) as a function of the phase of the
vibration cycle and vertical height within the cell. The data show strong
transient effects during the impact phase of the vibration. A detailed
discussion of the temporal passage of the individual phase resolved, height
resolved velocity distributions, along with seed velocity propagators at a fix
height from the vibrating base is presented.",2007-02-08T11:22:49Z
Statistical Interparticle Potential between Two Anyons,"The density matrix of a two-anyon system is evaluated and used to investigate
the ""statistical interparticle potential"" following the theory of Uhlenbeck.
The main purpose is to see how the statistical potential will depend on the
fractional statistical parameter $\alpha$. The result shows that the
statistical potential for a two-anyon system with $\alpha\ge {1\over2}$ is
always repulsive. For the system with $0<\alpha< {1\over2}$, the potential is
repulsive at short distances and becomes attractive at long distances. It
remains only in the boson system ($\alpha=0$) that the repulsive potential
arising from the exclusion principle can disappear and lead to an attractive
potential at all distances.",2007-01-29T15:43:21Z
Molecular dynamics study on planar clustering of xenon in UO2,"Interatomic potentials of uranium dioxide are investigated on their
applicability to model structural stabilities beyond fluorite phase by
comparing with ab-initio results. A high pressure cotunnite phase and loosely
stacking virtual crystal are involved in order to get a primary confidence for
large-scale deformation modelings of UO2 under irradiation damages. The
behavior of Xe atoms in UO2 fuel is studied with molecular dynamics
simulations. Besides the ground state bubble geometry, we find that a planar
distribution is also (meta-) stable for xenon under thermodynamic
perturbations. The Xe atoms with a planar configuration are in a liquid state
at a typical reactor temperature of 1000 K, which presents a modulated
layer-structure near the interface with solid UO2. A planar defects loop
remains after these Xe atoms are released out.",2007-03-26T01:25:17Z
"Vortex deformation and breaking in superconductors: A microscopic
  description","Vortex breaking has been traditionally studied for nonuniform critical
current densities, although it may also appear due to nonuniform pinning force
distributions. In this article we study the case of a
high-pinning/low-pinning/high-pinning layered structure. We have developed an
elastic model for describing the deformation of a vortex in these systems in
the presence of a uniform transport current density $J$ for any arbitrary
orientation of the transport current and the magnetic field. If $J$ is above a
certain critical value, $J_c$, the vortex breaks and a finite effective
resistance appears. Our model can be applied to some experimental
configurations where vortex breaking naturally exists. This is the case for
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ (YBCO) low angle grain boundaries and films on vicinal
substrates, where the breaking is experienced by Abrikosov-Josephson vortices
(AJV) and Josephson string vortices (SV), respectively. With our model, we have
experimentally extracted some intrinsic parameters of the AJV and SV, such as
the line tension $\epsilon_l$ and compared it to existing predictions based on
the vortex structure.",2007-01-08T15:32:30Z
"Decoherence and interactions in an electronic Mach-Zehnder
  interferometer","We develop a theoretical description of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer built
from integer quantum Hall edge states, with an emphasis on how
electron-electron interactions produce decoherence. We calculate the visibility
of interference fringes and noise power, as a function of bias voltage and of
temperature. Interactions are treated exactly, by using bosonization and
considering edge states that are only weakly coupled via tunneling at the
interferometer beam-splitters. In this weak-tunneling limit, we show that the
bias-dependence of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in source-drain conductance and
noise power provides a direct measure of the one-electron correlation function
for an isolated quantum Hall edge state. We find the asymptotic form of this
correlation function for systems with either short-range interactions or
unscreened Coulomb interactions, extracting a dephasing length $\ell_{\phi}$
that varies with temperature $T$ as $\ell_{\phi} \propto T^{-3}$ in the first
case and as $\ell_{\phi} \propto T^{-1} \ln^2(T)$ in the second case.",2007-03-06T19:26:06Z
"Resonance Fluorescence in Transport through Quantum Dots: Noise
  Properties","We study a two-level quantum dot embedded in a phonon bath and irradiated by
a time-dependent ac field and develope a method that allows us to extract
simultaneously the full counting statistics of the electronic tunneling and
relaxation (by phononic emission) events as well as their correlation. We find
that the quantum noise of both the transmitted electrons and the emitted
phonons can be controlled by the manipulation of external parameters such as
the driving field intensity or the bias voltage.",2007-03-05T15:48:21Z
Isolated Non-Equilibrium Systems in Contact,"We investigate a solvable model for energy conserving non-equilibrium steady
states. The time-reversal asymmetry of the dynamics leads to the violation of
detailed balance and to ergodicity breaking, as manifested by the presence of
dynamically inaccessible states. Two such systems in contact do not reach the
same effective temperature if standard definitions are used. However, we
identify the effective temperature that controls energy flow. Although this
operational temperature does reach a common value upon contact, the total
entropy of the joint system can decrease.",2007-03-01T21:44:19Z
"Three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Cold Fronts in
  Magnetically Turbulent ICM","Steep gradients of temperature and density, called cold fronts, are observed
by Chandra in a leading edge of subclusters moving through the intracluster
medium (ICM). The presence of cold fronts indicates that thermal conduction
across the front is suppressed by magnetic fields. We carried out
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations including anisotropic
thermal conduction of a subcluster moving through a magnetically turbulent ICM.
We found that turbulent magnetic fields are stretched and amplified by shear
flows along the interface between the subcluster and the ambient ICM. Since
magnetic fields reduce the efficiency of thermal conduction across the front,
the cold front survives at least 1 Gyr. We also found that a moving subcluster
works as an amplifier of magnetic fields. Numerical results indicate that
stretched turbulent magnetic fields accumulate behind the subcluster and are
further amplified by vortex motions. The moving subcluster creates a long tail
of ordered magnetic fields, in which the magnetic field strength attains plasma
beta < 10.",2007-03-20T19:42:50Z
"An Intrinsic Bond-Centered Electronic Glass with Unidirectional Domains
  in Underdoped Cuprates","Removing electrons from the CuO2 plane of cuprates alters the electronic
correlations sufficiently to produce high-temperature superconductivity.
Associated with these changes are spectral weight transfers from the high
energy states of the insulator to low energies. In theory, these should be
detectable as an imbalance between the tunneling rate for electron injection
and extraction - a tunneling asymmetry. We introduce atomic-resolution
tunneling-asymmetry imaging, finding virtually identical phenomena in two
lightly hole-doped cuprates: Ca1.88Na0.12CuO2Cl2 and Bi2Sr2Dy0.2Ca0.8Cu2O8+d.
Intense spatial variations in tunneling asymmetry occur primarily at the planar
oxygen sites; their spatial arrangement forms a Cu-O-Cu bond centered
electronic pattern without long range order but with 4a0-wide unidirectional
electronic domains dispersed throughout (a0: the Cu-O-Cu distance). The
emerging picture is then of a partial hole-localization within an intrinsic
electronic glass evolving, at higher hole-densities, into complete
delocalization and highest temperature superconductivity.",2007-03-12T22:29:55Z
Microscopic Current Dynamics in Nanoscale Junctions,"So far transport properties of nanoscale contacts have been mostly studied
within the static scattering approach. The electron dynamics and the transient
behavior of current flow, however, remain poorly understood. We present a
numerical study of microscopic current flow dynamics in nanoscale quantum point
contacts. We employ an approach that combines a microcanonical picture of
transport with time-dependent density-functional theory. We carry out atomic
and jellium model calculations to show that the time evolution of the current
flow exhibits several noteworthy features, such as nonlaminarity and edge flow.
We attribute these features to the interaction of the electron fluid with the
ionic lattice, to the existence of pressure gradients in the fluid, and to the
transient dynamical formation of surface charges at the nanocontact-electrode
interfaces. Our results suggest that quantum transport systems exhibit
hydrodynamical characteristics which resemble those of a classical liquid.",2007-01-26T18:25:04Z
"Effect of Static Disorder in an Electron Fabry-Perot Interferometer with
  Two Quantum Scattering Centers","In a recent paper -- F. Ciccarello \emph{et al.}, New J. Phys. \textbf{8},
214 (2006) -- we have demonstrated that the electron transmission properties of
a one-dimensional (1D) wire with two identical embedded spin-1/2 impurities can
be significantly affected by entanglement between the spins of the scattering
centers. Such effect is of particular interest in the control of transmission
of quantum information in nanostructures and can be used as a detection scheme
of maximally entangled states of two localized spins. In this letter, we relax
the constraint that the two magnetic impurities are equal and investigate how
the main results presented in the above paper are affected by a static disorder
in the exchange coupling constants of the impurities. Good robustness against
deviation from impurity symmetry is found for both the entanglement dependent
transmission and the maximally entangled states generation scheme.",2007-01-24T20:02:08Z
"Redistributing Chern numbers of Landau subbands: tight-binding electrons
  under staggered-modulated magnetic fields","We investigate the magneto-transport properties of electrons on a square
lattice under a magnetic field with the alternate flux strength
$\phi\pm\Delta\phi$ in neighboring plaquettes. A new peculiar behavior of the
Hall conductance has been found and is robust against weak disorder: if
$\phi={p\over{2N}}\times{2\pi}$ ($p$ and $2N$ are coprime integers) is fixed,
the Chern numbers of Landau subbands will be redistributed between neighboring
pairs and hence the total quantized Hall conductance exhibits a direct
transition by $\pm{N}e^2/h$ at critical fillings when $\Delta\phi$ is increased
from 0 up to a critical value $\Delta\phi_c$. This effect can be an
experimental probe of the staggered-flux phase.",2007-03-19T09:19:31Z
Spin-Photon Entangling Diode,"We propose a semiconductor device that can electrically generate entangled
electron spin-photon states, providing a building block for entanglement of
distant spins. The device consists of a p-i-n diode structure that incorporates
a coupled double quantum dot. We show that electronic control of the diode bias
and local gating allow for the generation of single photons that are entangled
with a robust quantum memory based on the electron spins. Practical performance
of this approach to controlled spin-photon entanglement is analyzed.",2007-02-28T17:41:28Z
Spin relaxation times in disordered graphene,"We consider two mechanisms of spin relaxation in disordered graphene. i) Spin
relaxation due to curvature spin orbit coupling caused by ripples. ii) Spin
relaxation due to the interaction of the electronic spin with localized
magnetic moments at the edges. We obtain analytical expressions for the spin
relaxation times, tau_SO and tau_J due to both mechanisms and estimate their
values for realistic parameters of graphene samples. We obtain that spin
relaxation originating from these mechanisms is very weak and spin coherence is
expected in disordered graphene up to samples of length L ~ 1 micron.",2007-02-19T17:48:27Z
Resonance Microwave Absorption in He II.,"Microwave (MW) absorption in liquid 4He is investigated in the frequency
range of 40-200 GHz at T = 1.4 - 2.5 K. Whispering gallery of waves was
generated by a dielectric disc resonator immersed into the liquid. Resonance
absorption of MWs was detected at 180.3 GHz, which corresponds to the roton
minimum of the liquid helium excitation spectrum. The creation of a single
roton is possible because of the presence of the resonator wall which absorbs
an extra momentum. The resonance frequency is shown to decreases with
temperature in an excellent agreement with the temperature dependence of the
roton gap obtained previously in the neutron scattering experiment. The
temperature dependence of the MW absorption data indicates the anomalous
behavior near the lambda-point and displays the hysteretic character.",2007-03-27T11:59:31Z
"Low Field, Current-Hysteretic Oscillations in Spin Transfer Nanocontacts","We have measured spin-transfer-driven, large amplitude, current hysteretic,
low frequency (< 500 MHz), narrowband oscillations in nanocontacts made to spin
valve structures. The oscillations occur in zero field, persist up to 5 mT for
in plane applied fields, and to beyond 400 mT for out of plane fields. Unlike
previous measurements, the oscillation frequency is well below that for
uniform-mode ferromagnetic resonance, is only a weak function of applied field,
and is highly anharmonic. The oscillations are hysteretic with applied dc
current, appearing at high currents but persisting to lower currents upon
decrease of the current. We suggest that these observations are consistent with
the dynamics of a nonuniform magnetic state in the vicinity of the contact
nucleated by both the spin transfer torque and dc current-generated Oersted
fields, with the dynamics driven by spin transfer. The electrical oscillation
amplitudes are large and narrowband, with the largest amplitudes on the order
of 1 mV and the narrowest linewidths below 1 MHz.",2007-02-17T21:47:52Z
"Thermodynamics of ultra-small metallic grains in the auxiliary-field
  Monte Carlo approach","We use an auxiliary-field Monte Carlo (AFMC) method to calculate
thermodynamic properties (spin susceptibility and heat capacity) of ultra-small
metallic grains in the presence of pairing correlations. This method allows us
to study the crossover from bulk systems, where mean-field BCS theory is valid,
to the fluctuation-dominated regime of ultra-small particles at finite
temperature. The computational effort at low temperatures is significantly
reduced by exploiting a simple renormalization method.",2007-02-13T19:59:13Z

From tunneling to contact: Inelastic signals in an atomic gold junction,"The evolution of electron conductance in the presence of inelastic effects is
studied as an atomic gold contact is formed evolving from a low-conductance
regime (tunneling) to a high-conductance regime (contact). In order to
characterize each regime, we perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations to study the geometric and electronic structures, together with
the strength of the atomic bonds and the associated vibrational frequencies.
The conductance is calculated by first evaluating the transmission of electrons
through the system, and secondly by calculating the conductance change due to
the excitation of vibrations. As found in previous studies [Paulsson et al.,
Phys. Rev. B. 72, 201101(R) (2005)] the change in conductance due to inelastic
effects permits to characterize the crossover from tunneling to contact. The
most notorious effect being the crossover from an increase in conductance in
the tunneling regime to a decrease in conductance in the contact regime when
the bias voltage matches a vibrational threshold. Our DFT-based calculations
actually show that the effect of vibrational modes in electron conductance is
rather complex, in particular when modes localized in the contact region are
permitted to extend into the electrodes. As an example, we find that certain
modes can give rise to decreases in conductance when in the tunneling regime,
opposite to the above mentioned result. Whereas details in the inelastic
spectrum depend on the size of the vibrational region, we show that the overall
change in conductance is quantitatively well approximated by the simplest
calculation where only the apex atoms are allowed to vibrate. Our study is
completed by the application of a simplified model where the relevant
parameters are obtained from the above DFT-based calculations.",2007-02-07T15:29:28Z
"Solvent coarse-graining and the string method applied to the hydrophobic
  collapse of a hydrated chain","Using computer simulations of over 100,000 atoms, the mechanism for the
hydrophobic collapse of an idealized hydrated chain is obtained. This is done
by coarse-graining the atomistic water molecule positions over 129,000
collective variables that represent the water density field and then using the
string method in these variables to compute the minimum free energy pathway
(MFEP) for the collapsing chain. The dynamical relevance of the MFEP (i.e. its
coincidence with the mechanism of collapse) is validated a posteriori using
conventional molecular dynamics trajectories. Analysis of the MFEP provides
atomistic confirmation for the mechanism of hydrophobic collapse proposed by
ten Wolde and Chandler. In particular, it is shown that lengthscale-dependent
hydrophobic dewetting is the rate-limiting step in the hydrophobic collapse of
the considered chain.",2007-02-17T10:05:52Z
"Electron corrected Lorentz forces in solids and molecules in magnetic
  field","We describe the effective Lorentz forces on the ions of a generic insulating
system in an magnetic field, in the context of Born-Oppenheimer ab-initio
molecular dynamics. The force on each ion includes an important contribution of
electronic origin, which depends explicitly on the velocity of all other ions.
It is formulated in terms of a Berry curvature, in a form directly suitable for
future first principles classical dynamics simulations based {\it e.g.,} on
density functional methods. As a preliminary analytical demonstration we
present the dynamics of an H$_2$ molecule in a field of intermediate strength,
approximately describing the electrons through Slater's variational
wavefunction.",2007-03-21T14:29:14Z
Spectroscopic observations of eight supernovae at intermediate redshift,"We present spectra of six Type Ia and two Type II supernovae obtained in June
2002 at the William Herschel Telescope during a search for Type Ia supernovae
(SNIa) at intermediate redshift. Supernova type identification and phase
determination are performed using a fitting technique based on a Xi2
minimization against a series of model templates. The spectra range from
z=0.033 to z=0.328, including one spectroscopically underluminous SNIa at
z=0.033. This set of spectra significantly increases the sample of
well-observed type SNIa supernovae available in the range 0.15< z <0.35.
Together with the twelve supernovae observed by our team in 1999 in the same
redshift range, they form an homogeneous sample of seventeen type Ia supernovae
with comparable signal-to-noise ratio and regular phase sampling in a still
largely unexplored region of the redshift space.",2007-03-26T17:53:38Z
"Signatures of a quantum dynamical phase transition in a three-spin
  system in presence of a spin environment","We have observed an environmentally induced quantum dynamical phase
transition in the dynamics of a two spin experimental swapping gate [J. Chem.
Phys. 124, 194507 (2006)]. There, the exchange of the coupled states |+,-> and
,+> gives an oscillation with a Rabi frecuency b/$\hbar$ (the spins coupling).
The interaction, $\hbar$/tSE with a spin-bath degrades the oscillation with a
characteristic decoherence time. We showed that the swapping regime is
restricted only to b\tSE>$hbar$. However, beyond a critical interaction with
the environment the swapping freezes and the system enters to a Quantum Zeno
dynamical phase where relaxation decreases as coupling with the environment
increases. Here, we solve the quantum dynamics of a two spin system coupled to
a spin-bath within a Liouville-von Neumann quantum master equation and we
compare the results with our previous work within the Keldysh formalism. Then,
we extend the model to a three interacting spin system where only one is
coupled to the environment. Beyond a critical interaction the two spins not
coupled to the environment oscillate with the bare Rabi frequency and relax
more slowly. This effect is more pronounced when the anisotropy of the
system-environment interaction goes from a purely XY to an Ising interaction
form.",2007-03-06T16:32:58Z
"Some problems in asymptotic convex geometry and random matrices

Quantum mechanics of spin transfer in coupled electron-spin chains,"The manner in which spin-polarized electrons interact with a magnetized thin
film is currently described by a semi-classical approach. This in turn provides
our present understanding of the spin transfer, or spin torque phenomenon.
However, spin is an intrinsically quantum mechanical quantity. Here, we make
the first strides towards a fully quantum mechanical description of spin
transfer through spin currents interacting with a Heisenberg-coupled spin
chain. Because of quantum entanglement, this requires a formalism based on the
density matrix approach. Our description illustrates how individual spins in
the chain time-evolve as a result of spin transfer.",2007-03-02T16:00:10Z
"Nearly-Exponential Size Lower Bounds for Symbolic Quantifier Elimination
  Algorithms and OBDD-Based Proofs of Unsatisfiability","We demonstrate a family of propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form
so that a formula of size $N$ requires size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt[7]{N/logN})}$ to
refute using the tree-like OBDD refutation system of Atserias, Kolaitis and
Vardi with respect to all variable orderings. All known symbolic quantifier
elimination algorithms for satisfiability generate tree-like proofs when run on
unsatisfiable CNFs, so this lower bound applies to the run-times of these
algorithms. Furthermore, the lower bound generalizes earlier results on
OBDD-based proofs of unsatisfiability in that it applies for all variable
orderings, it applies when the clauses are processed according to an arbitrary
schedule, and it applies when variables are eliminated via quantification.",2007-01-09T01:16:00Z
Are Complex A and the Orphan Stream related?,"We consider the possibility that the Galactic neutral hydrogen stream Complex
A and the stellar Orphan stream are related, and use this hypothesis to
determine possible distances to Complex A and the Orphan stream, and
line-of-sight velocities for the latter. The method presented uses our current
knowledge of the projected positions of the streams, as well as line-of-sight
velocities for Complex A, and we show that a solution exists in which the two
streams share the same orbit. If Complex A and the Orphan stream are on this
orbit, our calculations suggest the Orphan stream to be at an average distance
of 20 kpc, with heliocentric radial velocities of approximately -110 km/s.
Complex A would be ahead of the Orphan stream in the same wrap of the orbit,
with an average distance of 10 kpc, which is consistent with the distance
constraints determined through interstellar absorption line techniques.",2007-03-15T15:14:41Z
Current and strain-induced spin polarization in InGaN/GaN superlattices,"The lateral current-induced spin polarization in InGaN/GaN superlattices
(SLs) without an applied magnetic field is reported. The fact that the sign of
the nonequilibrium spin changes as the current reverses and is opposite for the
two edges provides a clear signature for the spin Hall effect. In addition, it
is discovered that the spin Hall effect can be strongly manipulated by the
internal strains. A theoretical work has also been developed to understand the
observed strain induced spin polarization. Our result paves an alternative way
for the generation of spin polarized current.",2007-02-26T03:48:55Z
"First-Principles Calculation of Be(0001) Thin Films: Quantum Size Effect
  and Adsorption of Atomic Hydrogen","We have carried out first-principles calculations of Be(0001) thin films to
study the oscillatory quantum size effects exhibited in the surface energy,
work function, and binding energy of the atomic hydrogen monolayer adsorption.
The prominent enhancement of the surface density of states at the Fermi level
makes Be(0001) thin films more metallic compared to the crystalline Be. As a
result, the calculated energetics of Be films and the properties of atomic H
adsorption onto Be(0001) surface are featured by a quantum oscillatory

Surface Nucleation in the Freezing of Gold Nanoparticles,"We use molecular simulation to calculate the nucleation free energy barrier
for the freezing of a 456 atom gold cluster over a range of temperatures. The
results show that the embryo of the solid cluster grows at the vapor-surface
interface for all temperatures studied and that the usual classical nucleation
model, with the embryo growing in the core of the cluster, is unable to predict
the shape of the free energy barrier. We use a simple partial wetting model
that treats the crystal as a lens shaped nucleus at the liquid-vapor interface
and find that the line tension plays an important role in the freezing of gold
nanoparticles.",2007-02-26T16:27:21Z
"Exact low temperature results for transport properties of the

characterization of the low temperature regime of the anisotropic interacting
resonant level (IRLM) model. We determine the low temperature corrections to

displays 'Coulomb deblocking' at resonance, i.e., a strong impurity-wire
capacitive coupling enhances the conductance at low temperature.",2007-03-21T11:46:56Z
The redshift distribution of absorption-line systems in QSO spectra,"A statistical analysis of the space-time distribution of absorption-line
systems (ALSs) observed in QSO spectra within the cosmological redshift
interval $z$=0.0--3.7 is carried out on the base of our catalog of absorption
systems (Ryabinkov et al. 2003). We confirm our previous conclusion that the
$z$-distribution of absorbing matter contains non-uniform component displaying
a pattern of statistically significant alternating maxima (peaks) and minima
(dips). Using the wavelet transformation we determine the positions of the
maxima and minima and estimate their statistical significance. The positions of
the maxima and minima of the $z$-distributions obtained for different celestial
hemispheres turn out to be weakly sensitive to orientations of the hemispheres.
The data reveal a regularity (quasi-periodicity) of the sequence of the peaks
and dips with respect to some rescaling functions of $z$. The same periodicity
was found for the one-dimensional correlation function calculated for the
sample of the ALSs under investigation. We assume the existence of a regular
structure in the distribution of absorption matter, which is not only spatial
but also temporal in nature with characteristic time varying within the
interval 150--650 Myr for the cosmological model applied.",2007-03-12T17:42:54Z
A Local Algorithm for Finding Dense Subgraphs,"We present a local algorithm for finding dense subgraphs of bipartite graphs,
according to the definition of density proposed by Kannan and Vinay. Our
algorithm takes as input a bipartite graph with a specified starting vertex,
and attempts to find a dense subgraph near that vertex. We prove that for any
subgraph S with k vertices and density theta, there are a significant number of
starting vertices within S for which our algorithm produces a subgraph S' with
density theta / O(log n) on at most O(D k^2) vertices, where D is the maximum
degree. The running time of the algorithm is O(D k^2), independent of the
number of vertices in the graph.",2007-02-13T23:41:46Z
Equilibrium spin currents in the Rashba medium,"We analyze equilibrium spin currents in a 2D electron gas with Rashba
spin-orbit interaction (Rashba medium). In a uniform Rashba medium these
currents are constant, and their ability to really transport spin is not
evident. But even weak inhomogeneity of the Rashba medium allows to reveal that
equilibrium spin currents can transport spin from areas where spin is produced
to areas where spin is absorbed.",2007-03-18T14:04:58Z
The Unix KISS: A Case Study,"In this paper we show that the initial philosophy used in designing and
developing UNIX in early times has been forgotten due to ""fast practices"". We
question the leitmotif that microkernels, though being by design adherent to
the KISS principle, have a number of context switches higher than their
monolithic counterparts, running a test suite and verify the results with
standard statistical validation tests. We advocate a wiser distribution of
shared libraries by statistically analyzing the weight of each shared object in
a typical UNIX system, showing that the majority of shared libraries exist in a
common space for no real evidence of need. Finally we examine the UNIX heritage
with an historical point of view, noticing how habits swiftly replaced the
intents of the original authors, moving the focus from the earliest purpose of
is avoiding complications, keeping a system simple to use and maintain.",2007-01-04T09:45:28Z
"Resonantly enhanced tunneling of Bose-Einstein condensates in periodic
  potentials","We report on measurements of resonantly enhanced tunneling of Bose-Einstein
condensates loaded into an optical lattice. By controlling the initial
conditions of our system we were able to observe resonant tunneling in the
ground and the first two excited states of the lattice wells. We also
investigated the effect of the intrinsic nonlinearity of the condensate on the
tunneling resonances.",2007-02-23T15:32:42Z
Nonlinear sigma model of a spin ladder containing a static single hole,"In this letter we extend the nonlinear sigma model describing pure spin
ladders with an arbitrary number of legs to the case of ladders containing a
single static hole. A simple immediate application of this approach to
classical ladders is worked out.",2007-01-24T17:09:31Z
"Construction of a Versatile Ultra-Low Temperature Scanning Tunneling
  Microscope","We constructed a dilution-refrigerator (DR) based ultra-low temperature
scanning tunneling microscope (ULT-STM) which works at temperatures down to 30
mK, in magnetic fields up to 6 T and in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). Besides these
extreme operation conditions, this STM has several unique features not
available in other DR based ULT-STMs. One can load STM tips as well as samples
with clean surfaces prepared in a UHV environment to an STM head keeping low
temperature and UHV conditions. After then, the system can be cooled back to
near the base temperature within 3 hours. Due to these capabilities, it has a
variety of applications not only for cleavable materials but also for almost
all conducting materials. The present ULT-STM has also an exceptionally high
stability in the presence of magnetic field and even during field sweep. We
describe details of its design, performance and applications for low
temperature physics.",2007-03-03T13:08:42Z
Smoking Supernovae,"The question ""Are supernovae important sources of dust?"" is a contentious
one. Observations with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the
Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) only detected very small amounts of hot dust
in supernova remnants. Here, we review observations of two young Galactic
remnants with the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA), which
imply that large quantities of dust are produced by supernovae. The association
of dust with the Cassiopeia A remnant is in question due to the contamination
of foreground material. In this article, we compare the emission from cold dust
with CO emission towards Kepler's supernova remnant. We detect very little CO
at the location of the submillimetre peaks. A comparison of masses from the CO
and the dust clouds are made, and we estimate the 3 sigma upper limit on the
gas-to-dust ratios to range from 25 - 65 suggesting that we cannot yet rule out
freshly-formed or swept up circumstellar dust in Kepler's supernova remnant.",2007-03-12T08:59:35Z
"Multiphase structure of finite-temperature phase diagram of the
  Blume-Capel model. Wang-Landau sampling method","We investigate the density of states (DOS) in an antiferromagnetic
spin-system on a square lattice described by the Blume-Capel (BC) model. We use
a new and very efficient simulation method, proposed by Wang and Landau, in
which we estimate very precisely DOS by sampling in the space of energy. Then
we calculate the thermodynamical averages like internal energy, free energy,
specific heat and entropy. The BC model exhibits multicritical behaviour such
as first- or second-order transitions and tricritical points. It is known that
the ground state of the model can exhibit two kinds of staggered
antiferromagnetic phases: AF1 (two interpenetrating lattices with S = -1 and S
= 1) and AF2 (S = -1 and S = 0 for H < 0; S = 1 and S = 0 for H > 0). We
analyze the coexistence of such phases at finite temperatures and determine
border lines between them. To understand the microscopic nature of such
boundaries we present also some results obtained with the standard Monte Carlo
method.",2007-03-12T15:53:06Z
"Continuous time random walk and parametric subordination in fractional
  diffusion","The well-scaled transition to the diffusion limit in the framework of the
theory of continuous-time random walk (CTRW)is presented starting from its
representation as an infinite series that points out the subordinated character
of the CTRW itself. We treat the CTRW as a combination of a random walk on the
axis of physical time with a random walk in space, both walks happening in
discrete operational time. In the continuum limit we obtain a generally
non-Markovian diffusion process governed by a space-time fractional diffusion
equation. The essential assumption is that the probabilities for waiting times
and jump-widths behave asymptotically like powers with negative exponents
related to the orders of the fractional derivatives. By what we call parametric
subordination, applied to a combination of a Markov process with a positively
oriented L\'evy process, we generate and display sample paths for some special
cases.",2007-01-06T18:14:39Z
Instability of current sheets and formation of plasmoid chains,"Current sheets formed in magnetic reconnection events are found to be
unstable to high-wavenumber perturbations. The instability is very fast: its
maximum growth rate scales as S^{1/4} v_A/L, where L is the length of the
sheet, v_A the Alfven speed and S the Lundquist number. As a result, a chain of
plasmoids (secondary islands) is formed, whose number scales as S^{3/8}.",2007-03-24T18:44:06Z
"Open system of interacting fermions: Statistical properties of cross
  sections and fluctuations","Statistical properties of cross sections are studied for an open system of
interacting fermions. The description is based on the effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian that accounts for the existence of open decay channels preserving
the unitarity of the scattering matrix. The intrinsic interaction is modelled
by the two-body random ensemble of variable strength. In particular, the
crossover region from isolated to overlapping resonances accompanied by the
effect of the width redistribution creating super-radiant and trapped states is
studied in detail. The important observables, such as average cross section,
its fluctuations, autocorrelation functions of the cross section and scattering
matrix, are very sensitive to the coupling of the intrinsic states to the
continuum around the crossover. A detailed comparison is made of our results
with standard predictions of statistical theory of cross sections, such as the
Hauser-Feshbach formula for the average cross section and Ericson theory of
fluctuations and correlations of cross sections. Strong deviations are found in
the crossover region, along with the dependence on intrinsic interactions and
degree of chaos inside the system.",2007-03-16T19:24:14Z
Enhanced Spin Dependent Shot Noise in Magnetic Tunnel Barriers,"We report the observation of enhanced spin dependent shot noise in magnetic
tunnel barriers, suggesting transport through localized states within the
barrier. This is supported by the existence of negative magnetoresistance and
structure in the differential conductance curves. A simple model of tunneling
through two interacting localized states with spin dependent tunneling rates is
used to explain our observations.",2007-01-18T20:57:27Z
Valence Bond Entanglement Entropy,"We introduce for SU(2) quantum spin systems the Valence Bond Entanglement
Entropy as a counting of valence bond spin singlets shared by two subsystems.
For a large class of antiferromagnetic systems, it can be calculated in all
dimensions with Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the valence bond basis. We
show numerically that this quantity displays all features of the von Neumann
entanglement entropy for several one-dimensional systems. For two-dimensional
Heisenberg models, we find a strict area law for a Valence Bond Solid state and
multiplicative logarithmic corrections for the Neel phase.",2007-03-01T16:10:49Z
Nonequilibrium tricriticality in one dimension,"We show the existence of a nonequilibrium tricritical point induced by a
repulsive interaction in one dimensional asymmetric exclusion process. The
tricritical point is associated with the particle-hole symmetry breaking
introduced by the repulsion. The phase diagram and the crossover in the
neighbourhood of the tricritical point for the shock formation at one of the
boundaries are determined.",2007-03-15T13:00:28Z
"Towards Execution Time Estimation for Logic Programs via Static Analysis
  and Profiling","Effective static analyses have been proposed which infer bounds on the number
of resolutions or reductions. These have the advantage of being independent
from the platform on which the programs are executed and have been shown to be
useful in a number of applications, such as granularity control in parallel
execution. On the other hand, in distributed computation scenarios where
platforms with different capabilities come into play, it is necessary to
express costs in metrics that include the characteristics of the platform. In
particular, it is specially interesting to be able to infer upper and lower
bounds on actual execution times. With this objective in mind, we propose an
approach which combines compile-time analysis for cost bounds with a one-time
profiling of the platform in order to determine the values of certain
parameters for a given platform. These parameters calibrate a cost model which,
from then on, is able to compute statically time bound functions for procedures
and to predict with a significant degree of accuracy the execution times of
such procedures in the given platform. The approach has been implemented and
integrated in the CiaoPP system.",2007-01-17T14:22:17Z
"Quantum LC - circuits with diffusive modification of the continuity
  equation","Proofs are given that the quantum-mechanical description of the LC-circuit
with a time dependent external source can be readily established by starting
from a general discretization rule of the electric charge. For this purpose one
resorts to an arbitrary but integer-dependent real function F(n) instead of n.
This results in a nontrivial generalization of the discrete time dependent
Schrodinger-equation established before via F(n)=n. Such generalization leads
to site-dependent hopping amplitudes as well as to diffusive modification of
the continuity equation. One shows, in particular, that there are firm supports
concerning rational multiples of the elementary electric charge.",2007-02-09T18:48:44Z
Strongly Correlated States of Ultracold Rotating Dipolar Fermi Gases,"We study strongly correlated ground and excited states of rotating quasi-2D
Fermi gases constituted of a small number of dipole-dipole interacting
particles with dipole moments polarized perpendicular to the plane of motion.
As the number of atoms grows, the system enters {\it an intermediate regime},
where ground states are subject to a competition between distinct bulk-edge
configurations. This effect obscures their description in terms of composite
fermions and leads to the appearance of novel composite fermion quasi-hole
states. In the presence of dipolar interactions, the principal Laughlin state
at filling $\nu=1/3$ exhibits a substantial energy gap for neutral (total
angular momentum conserving) excitations, and is well-described as an
incompressible Fermi liquid. Instead, at lower fillings, the ground state
structure favors crystalline order.",2007-02-10T21:14:25Z
"Invaded cluster algorithm for a tricritical point in a diluted Potts
  model","The invaded cluster approach is extended to 2D Potts model with annealed
vacancies by using the random-cluster representation. Geometrical arguments are
used to propose the algorithm which converges to the tricritical point in the
two-dimensional parameter space spanned by temperature and the chemical
potential of vacancies. The tricritical point is identified as a simultaneous
onset of the percolation of a Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster and of a percolation of
""geometrical disorder cluster"". The location of the tricritical point and the
concentration of vacancies for q = 1, 2, 3 are found to be in good agreement
with the best known results. Scaling properties of the percolating scaling
cluster and related critical exponents are also presented.",2007-03-28T15:05:44Z
"Optical study of the charge-density-wave mechanism in 2$H$-TaS$_2$ and
  Na$_x$TaS$_2$","We report an optical study of transition metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaS$_2$
and Na intercalated superconductor Na$_x$TaS$_2$ over a broad frequency range
at various temperatures. A clear gap feature was observed for 2$H$-TaS$_2$ when
it undergoes a CDW transition. The existence of a Drude component in
$\sigma$$_1$($\omega$) below T$_{CDW}$ indicates that the Fermi surface of
2$H$-TaS$_2$ is only partially gapped in CDW state. The spectral evolution of
two different Na$_x$TaS$_2$ crystals further confirms that the partial gap
structure observed in 2$H$-TaS$_2$ has a CDW origin. The CDW mechanism for
2$H$-TaS$_2$, the competition between CDW and superconductivity in
Na$_x$TaS$_2$ system are discussed.",2007-03-07T00:24:12Z
"Ultracold Fermi gases in the BEC-BCS crossover: a review from the

"Large-amplitude coherent spin waves exited by spin-polarized current in
  nanoscale spin valves","We present spectral measurements of spin-wave excitations driven by direct
spinpolarized current in the free layer of nanoscale
Ir20Mn80/Ni80Fe20/Cu/Ni80Fe20 spin valves. The measurements reveal that
large-amplitude coherent spin wave modes are excited over a wide range of bias
current. The frequency of these excitations exhibits a series of jumps as a
function of current due to transitions between different localized nonlinear
spin wave modes of the Ni80Fe20 nanomagnet. We find that micromagnetic
simulations employing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion augmented
by the Slonczewski spin torque term (LLGS) accurately describe the frequency of
the current-driven excitations including the mode transition behavior. However
LLGS simulations give qualitatively incorrect predictions for the amplitude of
excited spin waves as a function of current.",2007-03-17T17:41:46Z
"Performance of Rake Receivers in IR-UWB Networks Using Energy-Efficient
  Power Control","This paper studies the performance of partial-Rake (PRake) receivers in
impulse-radio ultrawideband wireless networks when an energy-efficient power
control scheme is adopted. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the
multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By making use of
noncooperative game-theoretic models and large-system analysis tools, explicit
expressions are derived in terms of network parameters to measure the effects
of self-interference and multiple-access interference at a receiving access
point. Performance of the PRake receivers is thus compared in terms of achieved
utilities and loss to that of the all-Rake receiver. Simulation results are
provided to validate the analysis.",2007-01-05T23:15:34Z
"Quantum criticality and minimal conductivity in graphene with long-range
  disorder","We consider the conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ of graphene with negligible
intervalley scattering at half filling. We derive the effective field theory,
which, for the case of a potential disorder, is a symplectic-class
$\sigma$-model including a topological term with $\theta=\pi$. As a
consequence, the system is at a quantum critical point with a universal value
of the conductivity of the order of $e^2/h$. When the effective time reversal
symmetry is broken, the symmetry class becomes unitary, and $\sigma_{xx}$
acquires the value characteristic for the quantum Hall transition.",2007-02-05T20:39:18Z
"Understanding Kondo Peak Splitting and the Mechanism of Cohernt
  Transport in a Single-Electron Transistor","The peculiar behavior of Kondo peak splitting under a magnetic field and bias
can be explained by calculating the nonequilibrium retarded Green's function
via the nonperturbative dynamical theory (NDT). In the NDT, the application of
a lead-dot-lead system reveals that new resonant tunneling levels are activated
near the Fermi level and the conventional Kondo peak at the Fermi level
diminishes when a bias is applied. Magnetic field causes asymmetry in the
spectral density and transforms the new resonant peak into a major peak whose
behavior explains all the features of the nonequilibrium Kondo phenomenon. We
also show the mechanism of coherent transport through the new resonant
tunneling level.",2007-02-11T04:43:53Z
"Gaussian noise and time-reversal symmetry in non-equilibrium Langevin
  models","We show that in driven systems the Gaussian nature of the fluctuating force
and time-reversibility are equivalent properties. This result together with the
potential condition of the external force drastically restricts the form of the
probability distribution function, which can be shown to satisfy
time-independent relations. We have corroborated this feature by explicitly
analyzing a model for the stretching of a polymer and a model for a suspension
of non-interacting Brownian particles in steady flow.",2007-02-15T11:31:21Z
"Model Reduction Applied to Square to Rectangular Martensitic
  Transformations Using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition","Model reduction using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is
applied to the dynamics of ferroelastic patches to study the first order square
to rectangular phase transformations. Governing equations for the system
dynamics are constructed by using the Landau-Ginzburg theory and are solved
numerically. By using the POD method, a set of empirical orthogonal basis
functions is first constructed, then the system is projected onto the subspace
spanned by a small set of basis functions determined by the associated singular
values. The performance of the low dimensional model is verified by simulating
nonlinear thermo-mechanical waves and square to rectangular transformations in
a ferroelastic patch. Comparison between numerical results obtained from the
original PDE model and the low dimensional one is carried out.",2007-02-28T15:12:26Z
"Perturbative calculation of non-local corrections to dynamical mean
  field theory","A technique allowing for a perturbative treatment of nonlocal corrections to
the single-site dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) in finite dimensions is
developed. It is based on the observation that in the case of strong electron
correlation the one-electron Green's function is strongly spatially damped so
that its intersite matrix elements may be considered as small perturbations.
Because the non-local corrections are at least quadratic in these matrix
elements, DMFT in such cases may be a very accurate approximation in dimensions
d = 1-3. This observation provides a rigorous justification for the application
of DMFT to physical systems. Furthermore, the technique allows for a systematic
evaluation of the nonlocal corrections. This is illustrated with the
calculation of the magnetic short range order parameter for nearest neighbor
spins in the half filled Hubbard model on the square lattice in its insulating
phase which exhibits an excellent agreement with the results of a recent
cluster approach.As a second example we study the lowest order correction to
the DMFT self-energy and its influence on the local density of states.",2007-02-01T08:02:32Z
Kallen-Lehman approach to 3D Ising model,"A ""Kallen-Lehman"" approach to Ising model, inspired by quantum field theory a
la Regge, is proposed. The analogy with the Kallen-Lehman representation leads
to a formula for the free-energy of the 3D model with few free parameters which
could be matched with the numerical data. The possible application of this
scheme to the spin glass case is shortly discussed.",2007-01-08T22:06:59Z
"The Kinematics of Intracluster Planetary Nebulae and the On-Going
  Subcluster Merger in the Coma Cluster Core","The Coma cluster is the richest and most compact of the nearby clusters, yet
there is growing evidence that its formation is still on-going. With a new
multi-slit imaging spectroscopy technique pioneered at the 8.2 m Subaru
telescope and FOCAS, we have detected and measured the line-of-sight velocities
of 37 intracluster planetary nebulae associated with the diffuse stellar
population of stars in the Coma cluster core, at 100 Mpc distance. We detect
clear velocity substructures within a 6 arcmin diameter field. A substructure
is present at ~5000 km/s, probably from in-fall of a galaxy group, while the
main intracluster stellar component is centered around ~6500 km/s, ~700 km/s
offset from the nearby cD galaxy NGC 4874. The kinematics and morphology of the
intracluster stars show that the cluster core is in a highly dynamically
evolving state. In combination with galaxy redshift and X-ray data this argues
strongly that the cluster is currently in the midst of a subcluster merger,
where the NGC 4874 subcluster core may still be self-bound, while the NGC 4889
subcluster core has probably dissolved. The NGC 4889 subcluster is likely to
have fallen into Coma from the eastern A2199 filament, in a direction nearly in
the plane of the sky, meeting the NGC 4874 subcluster arriving from the west.
The two inner subcluster cores are presently beyond their first and second
close passage, during which the elongated distribution of diffuse light has
been created. We predict the kinematic signature expected in this scenario, and
argue that the extended western X-ray arc recently discovered traces the arc
shock generated by the collision between the two subcluster gas halos. Any
preexisting cooling core region would have been heated by the subcluster
collision.",2007-03-29T20:01:04Z
Molecular dynamics of ice-nanotube formation inside carbon nanotubes,"The first order phase transition of a water cluster confined in a dynamic
single-walled carbon nanotube is investigated using a classical molecular
dynamics (MD) method. The formation of ice-nanotube is monitored through the
structure factor and potential energies. The transition temperature and its
diameter dependence obtained by the simulations agree well with those of
previously reported experiments. The transition temperature of the ice-nanotube
was shown to take a maximum value of around room temperature with the number of
the ring members n=5. Potential energy contribution to the phase change is
generally dominated by that of the intrinsic water-water interaction, while
that of water-carbon interaction plays a significant role on determining the
dependence of transition temperature on the nanotube diameter.",2007-02-23T08:46:27Z
"Macroscopic quantum tunneling in ""small"" Josephson junctions in magnetic
  field","We study the phenomenon of macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in small
Josephson junctions (JJ) with an externally applied magnetic field. The latter
results in the appearance of the Fraunhofer type modulation of the current
density along the barrier. The problem of MQT for a point-like JJ is reduced to
the motion of the quantum particle in the washboard potential. In the case of a
finite size JJ under consideration, this problem corresponds to a MQT in
potential which itself, besides the phase, depends on space variables. Finally,
the general expression for the crossover temperature T_0 between thermally
activated and macroscopic quantum tunneling regimes and the escaping time
tau_esc have been calculated.",2007-01-31T15:28:17Z
"Van der Waals density functional: Self-consistent potential and the
  nature of the van der Waals bond","We derive the exchange-correlation potential corresponding to the nonlocal
van der Waals density functional [M. Dion, H. Rydberg, E. Schroder, D. C.
Langreth, and B. I. Lundqvist, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. We use this
potential for a self-consistent calculation of the ground state properties of a
number of van der Waals complexes as well as crystalline silicon. For the
latter, where little or no van der Waals interaction is expected, we find that
the results are mostly determined by semilocal exchange and correlation as in
standard generalized gradient approximations (GGA), with the fully nonlocal
term giving little effect. On the other hand, our results for the van der Waals
complexes show that the self-consistency has little effect at equilibrium
separations. This finding validates previous calculations with the same
functional that treated the fully nonlocal term as a post GGA perturbation. A
comparison of our results with wave-function calculations demonstrates the
usefulness of our approach. The exchange-correlation potential also allows us
to calculate Hellmann-Feynman forces, hence providing the means for efficient
geometry relaxations as well as unleashing the potential use of other standard
techniques that depend on the self-consistent charge distribution. The nature
of the van der Waals bond is discussed in terms of the self-consistent bonding
charge.",2007-03-16T16:24:01Z
"Influence of Humidity on Microtribology of Vertically Aligned Carbon
  Nanotube Film","The aim of this study is to probe the influence of water vapor environment on
the microtribological properties of a forestlike vertically aligned carbon
nanotube (VACNT) film, deposited on a silicon (001) substrate by chemical vapor
deposition. Tribological experiments were performed using a gold tip under
relative humidity varying from 0 to 100%. Very low adhesion forces and high
friction coefficients of 0.6 to 1.3 resulted. The adhesion and friction forces
were independent of humidity, due probably to the high hydrophobicity of VACNT.
These tribological characteristics were compared to those of a diamond like
carbon (DLC) sample.",2007-03-28T09:06:19Z
"Kinematic modelling of disk galaxies I. A new method to fit tilted rings
  to data cubes","This is the first of a series of papers in which the kinematics of disk
galaxies over a range of scales is scrutinised employing spectroscopy. A
fundamental aspect of these studies is presented here: the new publicly
available software tool TiRiFiC
(http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~gjozsa/tirific.html) enables a direct fit of a
``tilted-ring model'' to spectroscopic data cubes. The algorithm generates
model data cubes from the tilted-ring parametrisation of a rotating disk, which
are automatically adjusted to reach an optimum fit via a chi-squared
minimisation method to an observed data cube. The structure of the new
software, the shortcomings of the previously available programs to produce a
tilted-ring model, and the performance of TiRiFiC are discussed. Our method is
less affected by the well-known problem of beam smearing that occurs when
fitting to the velocity field. Since with our method we fit many data points in
a data cube simultaneously, TiRiFiC is sensitive to very faint structures and
can hence be used to derive tilted-ring models significantly extending in
radius beyond those derived from a velocity field. The software is able to
parametrise HI disks of galaxies that are intersected by the line-of-sight
twice or more, i.e. if the disks are heavily warped, and/or with a significant
shift of the projected centre of rotation, and/or if seen edge-on. Furthermore,
our method delivers the surface-brightness profile of the examined galaxy in
addition to the orientational parameters and the rotation curve. In order to
derive kinematic and morphological models of disk galaxies, especially reliable
rotation curves, a direct-fit method as implemented in our code should be the
tool of choice.",2007-03-09T10:06:52Z
What is needed to exploit knowledge of primary transmissions?,"Recently, Tarokh and others have raised the possibility that a cognitive
radio might know the interference signal being transmitted by a strong primary
user in a non-causal way, and use this knowledge to increase its data rates.
However, there is a subtle difference between knowing the signal transmitted by
the primary and the actual interference at our receiver since there is a
wireless channel between these two points. We show that even an unknown phase
results in a substantial decrease in the data rates that can be achieved, and
thus there is a need to feedback interference channel estimates to the
cognitive transmitter. We then consider the case of fading channels. We derive
an upper bound on the rate for given outage error probability for faded dirt.
We give a scheme that uses appropriate ""training"" to obtain such estimates and
quantify this scheme's required overhead as a function of the relevant
coherence time and interference power.",2007-02-13T02:32:56Z
Tunneling Effect Near Weakly Isolated Horizon,"The tunneling effect near a weakly isolated horizon (WIH) has been studied.
By applying the null geodesic method of Parikh and Wilczek and Hamilton-Jacibi
method of Angheben et al. to a weakly isolated horizon, we recover the
semiclassical emission rate in the tunneling process. We show that the
tunneling effect exists in a wide class of spacetimes admitting weakly isolated
horizons. The general thermodynamic nature of WIH is then confirmed.",2007-02-06T02:54:15Z
Canonical band theory of non-collinear magnetism,"A canonical band theory of non-collinear magnetism is developed and applied
to the close packed fcc and bcc crystal structures. Several examples of
non-collinear magnetism in the periodic table are seen to be canonical in
origin. This is a parameter free theory where the crystal and magnetic
symmetry, and exchange splitting, uniquely determine the electronic bands. The
only contribution to the determination of magnetic stability is the change in
band energy due to hybridisation resulting from spin mixing, and on this basis
we are able to analyse the origin of the stability of non-collinear magnetic
structures, and the instability of the FM state towards non-collinear ordering.",2007-02-08T11:43:49Z
Ground state properties of a confined simple atom by C$_{60}$ fullerene,"We numerically study the ground state properties of endohedrally confined
hydrogen (H) or helium (He) atom by a molecule of C$_{60}$. Our study is based
on Diffusion Monte Carlo method. We calculate the effects of centered and small
off-centered H- or He-atom on the ground state properties of the systems and
describe the variation of ground state energies due to the C$_{60}$ parameters
and the confined atomic nuclei positions. Finally, we calculate the electron
distributions in $x-z$ plane in a wide range of C$_{60}$ parameters.",2007-03-12T15:32:38Z
"Performance Analysis of Algebraic Soft-Decision Decoding of Reed-Solomon
  Codes","We investigate the decoding region for Algebraic Soft-Decision Decoding (ASD)
of Reed-Solomon codes in a discrete, memoryless, additive-noise channel. An
expression is derived for the error correction radius within which the
soft-decision decoder produces a list that contains the transmitted codeword.
The error radius for ASD is shown to be larger than that of Guruswami-Sudan
hard-decision decoding for a subset of low-rate codes. These results are also
extended to multivariable interpolation in the sense of Parvaresh and Vardy. An
upper bound is then presented for ASD's probability of error, where an error is
defined as the event that the decoder selects an erroneous codeword from its
list. This new definition gives a more accurate bound on the probability of
error of ASD than the results available in the literature.",2007-01-04T01:43:56Z
"Analysis of the Sufficient Path Elimination Window for the
  Maximum-Likelihood Sequential-Search Decoding Algorithm for Binary
  Convolutional Codes","A common problem on sequential-type decoding is that at the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) below the one corresponding to the cutoff rate, the average
decoding complexity per information bit and the required stack size grow
rapidly with the information length. In order to alleviate the problem in the
maximum-likelihood sequential decoding algorithm (MLSDA), we propose to
directly eliminate the top path whose end node is $\Delta$-trellis-level prior
to the farthest one among all nodes that have been expanded thus far by the
sequential search. Following random coding argument, we analyze the
early-elimination window $\Delta$ that results in negligible performance
degradation for the MLSDA. Our analytical results indicate that the required
early elimination window for negligible performance degradation is just twice
of the constraint length for rate one-half convolutional codes. For rate
one-third convolutional codes, the required early-elimination window even
reduces to the constraint length. The suggestive theoretical level thresholds
almost coincide with the simulation results. As a consequence of the small
early-elimination window required for near maximum-likelihood performance, the
MLSDA with early-elimination modification rules out considerable computational
burdens, as well as memory requirement, by directly eliminating a big number of
the top paths, which makes the MLSDA with early elimination very suitable for
applications that dictate a low-complexity software implementation with near
maximum-likelihood performance.",2007-01-12T05:46:27Z
Ultra-Strong Coupling Effects with Quantum Metamaterials,"We study a semiconductor based quantum metamaterial which has the optical
characteristics of a metal in two directions, but behaves like a collection of
artificial atoms, whose properties can be designed in using quantum theory, in
the third. We find that it supports a new type of guided collective plasma
resonance (CPR) mode which exhibits efficient optical coupling and long
propagation distances. Furthermore, the coupling of the CPR mode with the
artificial atom transition leads to a case of Ultra Strong Coupling,
demonstrated by a large vacuum Rabi splitting of 65 meV, a sizable fraction (21
percent), of the bare intersubband energy.",2007-01-31T11:13:37Z
"Performance of Ultra-Wideband Impulse Radio in Presence of Impulsive
  Interference","We analyze the performance of coherent impulsive-radio (IR) ultra-wideband
(UWB) channel in presence of the interference generated by concurrent
transmissions of the systems with the same impulsive radio. We derive a novel
algorithm, using Monte-Carlo method, to calculate a lower bound on the rate
that can be achieved using maximum-likelihood estimator. Using this bound we
show that such a channel is very robust to interference, in contrast to the
nearest-neighbor detector.",2007-02-14T11:22:41Z
Diffusion and activation of n-type dopants in germanium,"The diffusion and activation of $n$-type impurities (P and As) implanted into
$p$-type Ge(100) substrates were examined under various dose and annealing
conditions. The secondary ion mass spectrometry profiles of chemical
concentrations indicated the existence of a sufficiently high number of
impurities with increasing implanted doses. However, spreading resistance probe
profiles of electrical concentrations showed electrical concentration
saturation in spite of increasing doses and indicated poor activation of As
relative to P in Ge. The relationships between the chemical and electrical
concentrations of P in Ge and Si were calculated, taking into account the
effect of incomplete ionization. The results indicated that the activation of P
was almost the same in Ge and Si. The activation ratios obtained experimentally
were similar to the calculated values, implying insufficient degeneration of
Ge. The profiles of P in Ge substrates with and without damage generated by Ge
ion implantation were compared, and it was clarified that the damage that may
compensate the activated $n$-type dopants has no relationship with the
activation of P in Ge.",2007-03-27T14:24:19Z
Peak Effect versus Skating in High Temperature Nanofriction,"The physics of sliding nanofriction at high temperature near the substrate
melting point $\Tmelt$ is so far unexplored. We conducted simulations of hard
tips sliding on a prototype non-melting surface, NaCl(100), revealing in this
regime two distinct and opposite phenomena for plowing and for grazing
friction. We found a frictional drop close to $\Tmelt$ for deep plowing and
wear, but on the contrary a frictional rise for grazing, wearless sliding. For
both phenomena we obtain a fresh microscopic understanding, relating the former
to ``skating'' through a local liquid cloud, the latter to linear response
properties of the free substrate surface. It is argued that both phenomena
should be pursued experimentally, and much more general than the specific NaCl
surface case. Most metals in particular possessing one or more close packed
non-melting surface, such as Pb, Al or Au(111), that should behave quite
similarly.",2007-03-13T09:27:14Z
Microstructure and charge-ordering transitions in LuFe2O4,"Microstructure properties, phase transitions, and charge ordering in the
LuFe2O4 materials have been extensively investigated by means of transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The (001) twins as a common defect frequently appear
in the LuFe2O4 crystals along the c-axis direction, and the crystals across
each boundary are rotated by 180 degree with respect to one another. The
in-situ cooling TEM observations reveal remarkable temperature dependence of
the superstructures in correlation with charger ordering (CO). The Fe2+, Fe3+,
and Fe+2.5 ions are found to be crystallized in ordered stripes at the
frustrated ground state characterized by a modulation with the wave vector of
q1 =(1/3 1/3 2). In-situ heating TEM observations on LuFe2O4 clearly
demonstrate that this modulation becomes evidently invisible above a critical
temperature of about Tc=530K. These facts suggest that the CO should be the
essential driving force for the structural transitions and ferroelectricity
observed in present system.",2007-03-04T13:33:56Z
New Constraints on the Galactic Bar,"Previous work has related the Galactic Bar to structure in the local stellar
velocity distribution. Here we show that the Bar also influences the spatial
gradients of the velocity vector via the Oort constants. By numerical
integration of test-particles we simulate measurements of the Oort C value in a
gravitational potential including the Galactic Bar. We account for the observed
trend that C is increasingly negative for stars with higher velocity
dispersion. By comparing measurements of C with our simulations we improve on
previous models of the Bar, estimating that the Bar pattern speed is
Omega_b/Omega_0=1.87\pm0.04, where Omega_0 is the local circular frequency, and
the Bar angle lies within 20<phi_0<45 deg. We find that the Galactic Bar
affects measurements of the Oort constants A and B less than ~2 km/s/kpc for
the hot stars.",2007-03-30T16:38:54Z
Why is Random Close Packing Reproducible?,"We link the thermodynamics of colloidal suspensions to the statistics of
regular and random packings. Random close packing has defied a rigorous
definition yet, in three dimensions, there is near universal agreement on the
volume fraction at which it occurs. We conjecture that the common value of
phi_rcp, approximately 0.64, arises from a divergence in the rate at which
accessible states disappear. We relate this rate to the equation of state for a
hard sphere fluid on a metastable, non-crystalline branch.",2007-01-15T17:13:57Z
Early Optical Polarization of a Gamma Ray Burst Afterglow,"We report the optical polarization of a gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglow,
obtained 203 seconds after the initial burst of gamma rays from GRB 060418,
using a ring polarimeter on the robotic Liverpool Telescope. Our robust
(2-sigma) upper limit on the percentage of polarization, less than 8%,
coincides with the fireball deceleration time at the onset of the afterglow.
The combination of the rate of decay of the optical brightness and the low
polarization at this critical time constrains standard models of GRB ejecta,
ruling out the presence of a large-scale ordered magnetic field in the emitting
region.",2007-03-26T16:20:08Z
"Commensurate Fluctuations in the Pseudogap and Incommensurate
  spin-Peierls Phases of TiOCl","X-ray scattering measurements on single crystals of TiOCl reveal the presence
of commensurate dimerization peaks within both the incommensurate spin-Peierls
phase and the so-called pseudogap phase above T_c2. This scattering is
relatively narrow in Q-space indicating long correlation lengths exceeding ~
100 A below T* ~ 130 K. It is also slightly shifted in Q relative to that of
the commensurate long range ordered state at the lowest temperatures, and it
coexists with the incommensurate Bragg peaks below T_c2. The integrated
scattering over both commensurate and incommensurate positions evolves
continuously with decreasing temperature for all temperatures below T* ~ 130 K.",2007-02-17T01:05:24Z
"Cerenkov-like radiation in a binary Schr{ö}dinger flow past an
  obstacle","We consider the dynamics of two coupled miscible Bose-Einstein condensates,
when an obstacle is dragged through them. The existence of two different speeds
of sound provides the possibility for three dynamical regimes: when both
components are subcritical, we do not observe nucleation of coherent
structures; when both components are supercritical they both form dark solitons
in one dimension (1D) and vortices or rotating vortex dipoles in two dimensions
(2D); in the intermediate regime, we observe the nucleation of a structure in
the form of a dark-antidark soliton in 1D; subcritical component; the 2D analog
of such a structure, a vortex-lump, is also observed.",2007-01-18T08:45:20Z
Timing the Eccentric Binary Millisecond Pulsar in NGC 1851,"We have used the Green Bank Telescope to observe the millisecond pulsar PSR
J0514-4002A on 43 occasions spread over 2 years. This 5-ms pulsar is located in
the globular cluster NGC 1851; it belongs to a binary system and has a highly
eccentric (e = 0.888) orbit. We have obtained a phase-coherent timing solution
for this object, including very precise position, spin and orbital parameters.
The pulsar is located 4.6"" (about 1.3 core radii) from the center of the
cluster, and is likely to lie on its more distant half. The non-detection of
eclipses at superior conjunction can be used, given the peculiar geometry of
this system, to rule out the possibility of an extended companion. We have
measured the rate of advance of periastron for this binary system to be
$\dot{\omega}$ = 0.01289(4) degrees per year, which if due completely to
general relativity, implies a total system mass of 2.453(14) solar masses.
Given the known mass function, the pulsar mass has to be < 1.5 solar masses,
and the mass of the companion has to be > 0.96 solar masses, implying that it
is a heavy white dwarf. The 350-MHz flux density of this pulsar varies between
0.2 and 1.4 mJy; the origin of these variations is not known.",2007-03-02T20:44:02Z
High Efficiency of Gamma-Ray Bursts Revisited,"Using the conservation of energy and momentum during collisions of any two
shells, we consider the efficiency of gamma-ray bursts by assuming that the
ejecta from the central engine are equally massive and have the same Lorentz
factors. We calculate the efficiency and the final Lorentz factor of the merged
whole shell for different initial diversities of Lorentz factors and for
different microscopic radiative efficiency. As a result, a common high
efficiency in the range of 0.1 to 0.9 is considerable, and a very high value
near 100% is also reachable if the diversity of the Lorentz factors is large
enough.",2007-03-07T03:30:06Z
"Current correlation functions for chemical sensors based on DNA
  decorated carbon nanotube","The current characteristics of DNA decorated carbon nanotubes for different
gas odors are studied. A simple model of charge transfer between the
Gas-DNA-base complex and single wall carbon nanotube (SWCN) is proposed to
explain the current response for different odors. The autocorrelation and
two-point correlation functions are calculated for the current sensitivity
curves. These correlation functions together with the current characteristics
form finger-prints for detection of the odor and DNA sequence.",2007-03-09T11:24:28Z
"Spin polarization effects in a two dimensional mesoscopic electronic
  structure with Rashba spin-orbit and lateral confinement","Because of the peculiar coupling of spatial and spin degrees of freedom
effected by the Rashba spin-orbit interaction, lateral confinement of a two
dimensional electronic system leads to a finite transverse spin polarization
near the longitudinal edges of a current carrying quantum wire. The sign of
this component of the polarization is opposite at the two edges and can be
reversed upon inversion of the current. Interestingly for small spin orbit
coupling this is the largest contribution to the total polarization, its
magnitude being of second order in the coupling constant. As a consequence this
phenomenon cannot be revealed in lowest order perturbative approaches. An in
plane spin polarization component is also present that is perpendicular to the
current. Within the same model this component would be also present in the
bulk. On the other hand while in the latter case its magnitude is linear in the
coupling constant, we find that it only represents a third order effect in the
wire geometry. Our results are consistent with a general rigorous argument on
the parity of the components of the spin polarization with respect to the sign
of the spin orbit coupling constant.",2007-01-17T14:33:41Z
In Situ Treatment of a Scanning Gate Microscopy Tip,"In scanning gate microscopy, where the tip of a scanning force microscope is
used as a movable gate to study electronic transport in nanostructures, the
shape and magnitude of the tip-induced potential are important for the
resolution and interpretation of the measurements. Contaminations picked up
during topography scans may significantly alter this potential. We present an
in situ high-field treatment of the tip that improves the tip-induced
potential. A quantum dot was used to measure the tip-induced potential.",2007-03-23T08:57:34Z
"Spitzer Limits On Dust Emission and Optical Gas Absorption Variability
  Around Nearby Stars with Edge-On Circumstellar Disk Signatures","We present Spitzer observations and McDonald Observatory Smith Telescope and
Anglo-Australian Telescope high spectral resolution optical observations of 4
nearby stars with variable or anomalous optical absorption, likely caused by
circumstellar material. The optical observations of CaII and NaI cover a 2.8
year baseline, and extend the long term monitoring of these systems by previous
researchers. In addition, mini-surveys of the local interstellar medium (LISM)
around our primary targets provide a reconstruction of the intervening LISM
along the line of sight. We confirm that the anomalous absorption detected
toward alpha Oph is not due to circumstellar material, but to a small
filamentary cloud <14.3 pc from the Sun. The three other primary targets, beta
Car, HD85905, and HR10 show both short and long term variability, and little of
the observed absorption can be attributed to the LISM along the line of sight.
The Spitzer observations did not detect infrared excesses. We are able to place
upper limits on any possible fractional infrared luminosity, which range from
L_IR/L_star < 2-5 10^-6, for our three disk stars. No stable gas absorption
component centered at the radial velocity of the star is detected for any of
our targets. Based on simple assumptions of the variable gas absorption
component, we estimate limits on the circumstellar gas mass causing the
variable absorption, which range from 0.4-20 10^-8 M_Earth. These
multiwavelength observations place strong limits on any possible circumstellar
dust, while confirming variable circumstellar gas absorption, and therefore are
interesting targets to explore the origins and evolution of variable
circumstellar gas. (abridged)",2007-03-05T21:10:07Z
"Ultra-sensitive surface absorption spectroscopy using sub-wavelength
  diameter optical fibers","The guided modes of sub-wavelength diameter air-clad optical fibers exhibit a
pronounced evanescent field. The absorption of particles on the fiber surface
is therefore readily detected via the fiber transmission. We show that the
resulting absorption for a given surface coverage can be orders of magnitude
higher than for conventional surface spectroscopy. As a demonstration, we
present measurements on sub-monolayers of 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride (PTCDA) molecules at ambient conditions, revealing the
agglomeration dynamics on a second to minutes timescale.",2007-01-12T14:23:30Z
Evidence for Cold Accretion onto a Massive Galaxy at High Redshift?,"In this letter we report on the discovery of a z=2.83 Lyman-alpha Blob (LAB)
found in our wide field narrow-band survey within the Spitzer First Look Survey
region. The blob is extended over at least 95kpc and has a total Lyman-alpha
luminosity of 2.1 x 10^44 erg/s. It is only the sixth LAB known of this scale
(> 50 kpc), and is associated with an embedded continuum source in g', R, i', K
& 4.5 um bands. The LAB's optical spectrum shows clumpy structures and
tantalising hints of a sharp red cut-off and shear within the Ly-alpha emission
line. Studies of the LAB's surface brightness profile and of the continuum
counterpart's spectral energy distribution (SED) indicate that the profuse
Lyman-alpha emission is consistent with being powered by cold gas accreting
onto a massive dark matter halo.",2007-03-20T10:59:19Z
"Spin waves throughout the Brillouin zone and magnetic exchange coupling
  in ferromagnetic metallic manganites La$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$MnO$_3$
  ($x=0.25,0.30$)","Using time-of-flight and triple-axis inelastic neutron spectroscopy, we
determine spin wave excitations throughout the Brillouin zone for ferromagnetic
manganites La$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$MnO$_3$ ($x=0.25,0.3$) in their low temperature
metallic states. While spin wave excitations in the long wavelength limit (spin
stiffness $D$) have similar values for both compounds, the excitations near the
Brillouin zone boundary of La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ are considerable
softened in all symmetry directions compared to that of
La$_{0.75}$Ca$_{0.25}$MnO$_3$. A Heisenberg model with the nearest neighbor and
the fourth neighbor exchange interactions can describe the overall dispersion
curves fairly well. We compare the data with various theoretical models
describing the spin excitations of ferromagnetic manganites.",2007-02-21T20:25:40Z
"Effect of spatial dispersion on the spectrum of inter-edge
  magnetoplasmons in the two-dimensional heterogeneous system","The present paper is devoted to the theoretical study of the spectrum of
low-frequency electronic density oscillations running along the boundary of two
contacting two-dimensional electronic systems in the perpendicular magnetic
field. For the first time, such waves were predicted in the Institute of
Radio-engineering and Electronics of RAS (V.A. Volkov, S.A. Mikhailov, 1992),
studied experimentally in the papers of foreign investigations and called
inter-edge magnetoplasmons (IEMP). When the two-dimensional system is finite
and has the half-plane shape, the internal boundary becomes external and these
plasmons go over into the well-known edge magnetoplasmons. The existing theory
of edge and inter-edge magnetoplasmons is built with the neglect of spatial
dispersion of the conductivity. Here we attempt to derive and analyze the IEMP
dispersion equation involving spatial dispersion of conductivity. The inner
boundary is assumed to be a straight line at which the electron concentration
changes weakly but stepwise. The jump of the diagonal conductivity is
considered small compared with that of the Hall magnetoconductivity. The IEMP
frequency is small compared with the cyclotron frequency. The IEMP frequency as
a function of wavevector oscillates with the period determined by a ratio of
electron cyclotron radius to the plasmon wavelength. For long wavelengths, the
IEMP dispersion curve coincides with the known result.",2007-03-15T17:04:50Z
Towards Resolving the Evolution of Multi-Supernova Superbubbles,"Interstellar superbubbles generated by multiple supernova explosions are
common in star-forming galaxies. They are the most obvious manifestation of
mechanical feedback, and are largely responsible for transferring both thermal
and kinetic energy to the interstellar medium from the massive star population.
However, the details of this energy transfer remain surprisingly murky when
individual objects are studied. I will summarize what we currently know about
candidate dominant processes on these scales.",2007-03-02T00:40:24Z
"Decoherence processes of a quantum two-level system coupled to a
  fermionic environment","We study decoherence processes of an S = 1/2 localized spin coupled to
conduction band electrons in a metal or a semiconductor via an Ising-like
interaction. We derive master equations for the density matrix of the localized
spin, by tracing out all degrees of freedom in the conduction electron system
based on the linked-cluster-expansion technique. It is found that the
decoherence occurs more rapidly for the metallic case than for semiconducting
case.",2007-02-13T10:42:01Z
Von Neumann's expanding model on random graphs,"Within the framework of Von Neumann's expanding model, we study the maximum
growth rate r achievable by an autocatalytic reaction network in which
reactions involve a finite (fixed or fluctuating) number D of reagents. r is
calculated numerically using a variant of the Minover algorithm, and
analytically via the cavity method for disordered systems. As the ratio between
the number of reactions and that of reagents increases the system passes from a
contracting (r<1) to an expanding regime (r>1). These results extend the
scenario derived in the fully connected model ($D\to\infinity$), with the
important difference that, generically, larger growth rates are achievable in
the expanding phase for finite D and in more diluted networks. Moreover, the
range of attainable values of r shrinks as the connectivity increases.",2007-03-13T15:05:09Z
Direct evidence of acceleration from distance modulus redshift graph,"The energy conditions give upper bounds on the luminosity distance. We apply
these upper bounds to the 192 essence supernova Ia data to show that the
Universe had experienced accelerated expansion. This conclusion is drawn
directly from the distance modulus-reshift graph. In addition to be a very
simple method, this method is also totally independent of any cosmological
model. From the degeneracy of the distance modulus at low redshift, we argue
that the choice of $w_0$ for probing the property of dark energy is misleading.
One explicit example is used to support this argument.",2007-03-22T17:41:20Z
"Enhanced magneto-transport at high bias in quasi-magnetic tunnel
  junctions with EuS spin-filter barriers","In quasi-magnetic tunnel junctions (QMTJs) with a EuS spin filter tunnel
barrier between Al and Co electrodes, we observed large magnetoresistance (MR).
The bias dependence shows an abrupt increase of MR ratio in high bias voltage,
which is contrary to conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). This
behavior can be understood as due to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling through the
fully spin-polarized EuS conduction band. The I-V characteristics and bias
dependence of MR calculated using tunneling theory shows excellent agreement
with experiment.",2007-03-12T10:23:26Z
Two Dimensional Directed Lattice Walks with Boundaries,"We present general algorithms (fully implemented in Maple) for calculations

"High-Frequency Nanofluidics: An Experimental Study using Nanomechanical
  Resonators","Here we apply nanomechanical resonators to the study of oscillatory fluid
dynamics. A high-resonance-frequency nanomechanical resonator generates a
rapidly oscillating flow in a surrounding gaseous environment; the nature of
the flow is studied through the flow-resonator interaction. Over the broad
frequency and pressure range explored, we observe signs of a transition from
Newtonian to non-Newtonian flow at $\omega\tau\approx 1$, where $\tau$ is a
properly defined fluid relaxation time. The obtained experimental data appears
to be in close quantitative agreement with a theory that predicts purely
elastic fluid response as $\omega\tau\to \infty$.",2007-03-08T22:49:29Z
Quantum confinement effects in InAs-InP core-shell nanowires,"We report the detection of quantum confinement in single InAs-InP core-shell
nanowires. The wires having an InAs core with ~25 nm diameter are characterized
by emission spectra in which two peaks are identified under high excitation
intensity conditions. The peaks are caused by emission from the ground and
excited quantized levels, due to the quantum confinement in the plane
perpendicular to the nanowire axis. We have identified in the emission spectra
different energy contributions related to the wurtzite structure of the wires,
the strain between the wurtzite core and shell, and the confinement energy of
the InAs core. Calculations based on 6-band strain-dependent k.p theory allow
the theoretical estimation of the confined energy states in such materials and
we found these results to be in good agreement with those from the
photoluminescence studies.",2007-01-04T17:57:24Z
"The Oblate Schwarzschild Approximation for Light Curves of Rapidly
  Rotating Neutron Stars","We present a simple method for including the oblateness of a rapidly rotating
neutron star when fitting X-ray light curves. In previous work we showed that
the oblateness induced by rotation at frequencies above 300 Hz produces a
geometric effect which needs to be accounted for when modelling light curves to
extract constraints on the neutron star's mass and radius. In our model X-rays
are emitted from the surface of an oblate neutron star and propagate to the
observer along geodesics of the Schwarzschild metric for a spherical neutron
star. Doppler effects due to rotation are added in the same manner as in the
case of a spherical neutron star. We show that this model captures the most
important effects due to the neutron star's rotation. We also explain how the
geometric oblateness effect can rival the Doppler effect for some emission
geometries.",2007-03-06T18:32:44Z
"Conformation dependence of molecular conductance: chemistry versus
  geometry","Recent experiments by Venkatamaran {\em et al.} [Nature (London) {\bf 442},
904 (2006)] on a series of molecular wires with varying chemical compositions,
revealed a linear dependence of the conductance on $\mathrm{cos}^2\theta$,
where $\theta$ is the angle of twist between neighboring aromatic rings. To
investigate whether or not this dependence has a more general applicability, we
present a first principles theoretical study of the transport properties of
this family of molecules as a function of the chemical composition,
conformation and the contact atom and geometry. If the Fermi energy
$E_\mathrm{F}$ lies within the HOMO-LUMO gap, then we reproduce the above
experimental results. More generally, however, if $E_\mathrm{F}$ is located
within either the LUMO or HOMO states, the presence of resonances destroys the
linear dependence of the conductance on $\mathrm{cos}^2\theta$ and gives rise
to non-monotonic behaviour associated with the level structure of the different
molecules. Our results suggest that the above experiments provide a novel
method for extracting spectroscopic information about molecules contacted to
electrodes.",2007-03-05T18:34:14Z
Adiabatic Domain Wall Motion and Landau-Lifshitz Damping,"Recent theory and measurements of the velocity of current-driven domain walls
in magnetic nanowires have re-opened the unresolved question of whether
Landau-Lifshitz damping or Gilbert damping provides the more natural
description of dissipative magnetization dynamics. In this paper, we argue that
(as in the past) experiment cannot distinguish the two, but that
Landau-Lifshitz damping nevertheless provides the most physically sensible
interpretation of the equation of motion. From this perspective, (i) adiabatic
spin-transfer torque dominates the dynamics with small corrections from
non-adiabatic effects; (ii) the damping always decreases the magnetic free
energy, and (iii) microscopic calculations of damping become consistent with
general statistical and thermodynamic considerations.",2007-02-01T15:24:49Z
New evidence on the origin of the microquasar GRO J1655-40,"Aims. Motivated by the new determination of the distance to the microquasar
GRO J1655-40 by Foellmi et al. (2006), we conduct a detailed study of the
distribution of the atomic and molecular gas, and dust around the open cluster
NGC 6242, the possible birth place of the microquasar. The proximity and
relative height of the cluster on the galactic disk provides a unique
opportunity to study SNR evolution and its possible physical link with
microquasar formation. Methods. We search in the interstellar atomic and
molecular gas around NGC 6242 for traces that may have been left from a
supernova explosion associated to the formation of the black hole in GRO
J1655-40. Furthermore, the 60/100 mu IR color is used as a tracer of
shocked-heated dust. Results. At the kinematical distance of the cluster the
observations have revealed the existence of a HI hole of 1.5*1.5 degrees in
diameter and compressed CO material acumulated along the south-eastern internal
border of the HI cavity. In this same area, we found extended infrared emission
with characteristics of shocked-heated dust. Based on the HI, CO and FIR
emissions, we suggest that the cavity in the ISM was produced by a supernova
explosion occured within NGC 6242. The lower limit to the kinematic energy
transferred by the supernova shock to the surrounding interstellar medium is ~
10^{49} erg and the atomic and molecular mass displaced to form the cavity of ~
16.500 solar masses. The lower limit to the time elapsed since the SN explosion
is ~ 2.2*10^{5} yr, which is consistent with the time required by GRO J1655-40
to move from the cluster up to its present position. The observations suggest
that GRO J1655-40 could have been born inside NGC 6242, being one of the
nearest microquasars known so far.",2007-03-27T08:30:35Z
"Homotheties of Cylindrically Symmetric Static Manifolds and their Global
  Extension","Cylindrically symmetric static manifolds are classified according to their
homotheties and metrics. In each case the homothety vector fields and the
corresponding metrics are obtained explicitly by solving the homothety
equations. It turns out that these metrics admit homothety groups $H_m$, where
$m=4,5,7,11$. This classification is then used to identify the cylindrically
symmetric static spaces admitting the local homotheties, which are globally
prohibited due to their topological construction. Einstein's field equations
are then used to identify the physical nature of the spaces thus obtained.",2007-02-06T13:16:47Z
The resonance peak in the electron-doped cuprate superconductors,"We study the emergence of a magnetic resonance in the superconducting state
of the electron-doped cuprate superconductors. We show that the recently
observed resonance peak in the electron-doped superconductor
Pr$_{0.88}$LaCe$_{0.12}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ is consistent with an overdamped spin
exciton located near the particle-hole continuum. We present predictions for
the magnetic-field dependence of the resonance mode as well as its temperature
evolution in those parts of the phase diagram where $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave
superconductivity may coexist with an antiferromagnetic spin-density wave.",2007-02-15T21:02:14Z
Theory of resonant spin Hall effect,"A biref review is presented on resonant spin Hall effect, where a tiny
external electric field induces a saturated spin Hall current in a
2-dimensional electron or hole gas in a perpendicular magnetic field. The
phenomenon is attributted to the energy level crossing associated with the
spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman splitting. We summarize recent theoretical
development of the effect in various systems and discuss possible experiments
to observe the effect.",2007-03-07T10:10:22Z
The effect of dust on Tremaine-Weinberg measurements,"We investigate the effect of dust on the observed rotation rate of a stellar
bar. The only direct way to measure this quantity relies on the Tremaine &
Weinberg method which requires that the tracer satisfies the continuity
equation. Thus it has been applied largely to early-type barred galaxies. We
show using numerical simulations of barred galaxies that dust attenuation
factors typically found in these systems change the observed bar pattern speed
by 20-40 percent. We also address the effect of star formation on the TW method
and find that it does not change the results significantly. The results
presented here suggest that applications of the TW method can be extended to
include barred galaxies covering the full range of Hubble type.",2007-03-23T15:37:32Z
Model-Independent Sum Rule Analysis Based on Limited-Range Spectral Data,"Partial sum rules are widely used in physics to separate low- and high-energy
degrees of freedom of complex dynamical systems. Their application, though, is
challenged in practice by the always finite spectrometer bandwidth and is often
performed using risky model-dependent extrapolations. We show that, given
spectra of the real and imaginary parts of any causal frequency-dependent
response function (for example, optical conductivity, magnetic susceptibility,
acoustical impedance etc.) in a limited range, the sum-rule integral from zero
to a certain cutoff frequency inside this range can be safely derived using
only the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations without any extra model
assumptions. This implies that experimental techniques providing both active

ellipsometry in optics, allow an extrapolation-independent determination of
spectral weight 'hidden' below the lowest accessible frequency.",2007-01-24T12:28:52Z

"How to study correlation functions in fluctuating Bose liquids using
  interference experiments","Interference experiments with independent condensates provide a powerful tool
for analyzing correlation functions. Scaling of the average fringe contrast
with the system size is determined by the two-point correlation function and
can be used to study the Luttinger liquid liquid behavior in one-dimensional
systems and to observe the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in two-dimensional
quasicondensates. Additionally, higher moments of the fringe contrast can be
used to determine the higher order correlation functions. In this article we
focus on interference experiments with one-dimensional Bose liquids and show
that methods of conformal field theory can be applied to calculate the full
quantum distribution function of the fringe contrast.",2007-02-27T16:51:37Z
Approximation Algorithms for Multiprocessor Scheduling under Uncertainty,"Motivated by applications in grid computing and project management, we study
multiprocessor scheduling in scenarios where there is uncertainty in the
successful execution of jobs when assigned to processors. We consider the
problem of multiprocessor scheduling under uncertainty, in which we are given n
unit-time jobs and m machines, a directed acyclic graph C giving the
dependencies among the jobs, and for every job j and machine i, the probability
p_{ij} of the successful completion of job j when scheduled on machine i in any
given particular step. The goal of the problem is to find a schedule that
minimizes the expected makespan, that is, the expected completion time of all
the jobs.
  The problem of multiprocessor scheduling under uncertainty was introduced by
Malewicz and was shown to be NP-hard even when all the jobs are independent. In
this paper, we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the
problem, for special cases of the dag C. We obtain an O(log(n))-approximation
for the case of independent jobs, an
O(log(m)log(n)log(n+m)/loglog(n+m))-approximation when C is a collection of
disjoint chains, an O(log(m)log^2(n))-approximation when C is a collection of
directed out- or in-trees, and an
O(log(m)log^2(n)log(n+m)/loglog(n+m))-approximation when C is a directed
forest.",2007-03-21T20:35:40Z
"Finite temperature phase diagram of a polarized Fermi gas in an optical
  lattice","We present phase diagrams for a polarized Fermi gas in an optical lattice as
a function of temperature, polarization, and lattice filling factor. We
consider the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO), Sarma or breached pair
(BP), and BCS phases, and the normal state and phase separation. We show that
the FFLO phase appears in a considerable portion of the phase diagram. The
diagrams have two critical points of different nature. We show how various
phases leave clear signatures to momentum distributions of the atoms which can
be observed after time of flight expansion.",2007-01-19T18:36:17Z
Quantum Monte Carlo simulation of spin-polarized H,"The ground-state properties of spin polarized hydrogen H$\downarrow$ are
obtained by means of diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Using the most
accurate to date ab initio H$\downarrow$-H$\downarrow$ interatomic potential we
have studied its gas phase, from the very dilute regime until densities above
its freezing point. At very small densities, the equation of state of the gas
is very well described in terms of the gas parameter $\rho a^3$, with $a$ the
s-wave scattering length. The solid phase has also been studied up to high
pressures. The gas-solid phase transition occurs at a pressure of 173 bar, a
much higher value than suggested by previous approximate descriptions.",2007-02-19T15:42:00Z
"Effect of interface disorder on quantum well excitons and microcavity
  polaritons","The theory of the linear optical response of excitons in quantum wells and
polaritons in planar semiconductor microcavities is reviewed, in the light of
the existing experiments. For quantum well excitons, it is shown that disorder
mainly affects the exciton center-of-mass motion and is modeled by an effective
Schroedinger equation in two dimensions. For polaritons, a unified model
accounting for quantum well roughness and fluctuations of the microcavity
thickness is developed. Numerical results confirm that polaritons are mostly
affected by disorder acting on the photon component, thus confirming existing
studies on the influence of exciton disorder. The polariton localization length
is estimated to be in the few-micrometer range, depending on the amplitude of
disorder, in agreement with recent experimental findings.",2007-02-07T16:48:15Z
Detecting ionized bubbles in redshifted 21 cm maps,"The reionization of the Universe, it is believed, occurred by the growth of
ionized regions (bubbles) in the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). We study
the possibility of detecting these bubbles in radio-interferometric
observations of redshifted neutral hydrogen (HI) 21 cm radiation. The signal 1
mJy will be buried in noise and foregrounds, the latter being at least a few
orders of magnitude stronger than the signal. We develop a visibility based
formalism that uses a filter to optimally combine the entire signal from a
bubble while minimizing the noise and foreground contributions. This formalism
makes definite predictions on the ability to detect an ionized bubble or
conclusively rule out its presence in a radio- interferometric observation. We
make predictions for the currently functioning GMRT and a forthcoming
instrument, the MWA at a frequency of 150 MHz (corresponding to a redshift of
8.5). For both instruments, we show that a 3 sigma detection will be possible
for a bubble of comoving radius R_b > 40 Mpc (assuming it to be spherical) in
100 hrs of observation and R_b 22 Mpc in 1000 hrs of observation, provided the
bubble is at the center of the field of view. In both these cases the filter
effectively removes the expected foreground contribution so that it is below
the signal, and the system noise is the deciding criteria. We find that there
is a fundamental limitation on the smallest bubble that can be detected arising
from the statistical fluctuations in the HI distribution. Assuming that the HI
traces the dark matter we find that it will not be possible to detect bubbles
with R_b < 8 Mpc using the GMRT and R_b < 16 Mpc using the MWA, however large
be the integration time.",2007-03-27T10:38:49Z
"On the decidability and complexity of Metric Temporal Logic over finite
  words","Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a prominent specification formalism for
real-time systems. In this paper, we show that the satisfiability problem for
MTL over finite timed words is decidable, with non-primitive recursive
complexity. We also consider the model-checking problem for MTL: whether all
words accepted by a given Alur-Dill timed automaton satisfy a given MTL
formula. We show that this problem is decidable over finite words. Over
infinite words, we show that model checking the safety fragment of MTL--which
includes invariance and time-bounded response properties--is also decidable.
These results are quite surprising in that they contradict various claims to
the contrary that have appeared in the literature.",2007-02-21T16:14:34Z
"Control of many electron states in semiconductor quantum dots by
  non-Abelian vector potentials","Adiabatic time evolution of degenerate eigenstates of a quantum system
provides a means for controlling electronic states since mixing between
degenerate levels generates a matrix Berry phase. In the presence of spin-orbit
coupling in n-type semiconductor quantum dots the electron Hamiltonian is
invariant under time reversal operation and the many body groundstate may be
doubly degenerate. This double degeneracy can generate non-Abelian vector
potentials when odd number of electrons are present. We find that the
antisymmetry of many electron wavefunction has no effect on the matrix Berry
phase. We have derived equations that allow one to investigate the effect of
electron correlations by expressing the non-Abelian vector potentials for many
electron system in terms of single electron non-Abelian vector potentials.",2007-01-15T07:38:46Z
"Spatially heterogenous dynamics in dense, driven granular flows","Interest in the dynamical arrest leading to a fluid --> solid transition in
thermal and athermal systems has led to questions about the nature of these
transitions. These jamming transitions may be dependent on the influence of
extended structures on the dynamics of the system. Here we show results from a
simple driven, dissipative, non-equilibrium system which exhibits dynamical
heterogeneities similar to those observed in a supercooled liquid which is a
system in thermal equilibrium. Observations of the time $\tau_R(r)$ required
for a particular particle to move a distance $r$ reveal the existence of
large-scale correlated dynamical regions with characteristic timescales chosen
from a broad distribution. The mean squared displacement of ensembles of
particles with varying characteristic $\tau_R(r)$ reveals an intriguing
spatially heterogenous mobility. This suggests that a unified framework for
jamming will have to be based on the connection between the nature of these
heterogeneities and the effective dynamics.",2007-02-28T06:39:33Z
A Comparison of On-Line Computer Science Citation Databases,"This paper examines the difference and similarities between the two on-line
computer science citation databases DBLP and CiteSeer. The database entries in
DBLP are inserted manually while the CiteSeer entries are obtained autonomously
via a crawl of the Web and automatic processing of user submissions. CiteSeer's
autonomous citation database can be considered a form of self-selected on-line
survey. It is important to understand the limitations of such databases,
particularly when citation information is used to assess the performance of
authors, institutions and funding bodies.
  We show that the CiteSeer database contains considerably fewer single author
papers. This bias can be modeled by an exponential process with intuitive
explanation. The model permits us to predict that the DBLP database covers
approximately 24% of the entire literature of Computer Science. CiteSeer is
also biased against low-cited papers.
  Despite their difference, both databases exhibit similar and significantly
different citation distributions compared with previous analysis of the Physics
community. In both databases, we also observe that the number of authors per
paper has been increasing over time.",2007-03-09T16:00:55Z
"X-ray Reflectivity Studies of Atomic-level Surface-segregation in a
  Liquid Eutectic Alloy of AuSn","X-ray reflectivity studies reveal atomic-level surface-segregation at the
free surface of the eutectic Au71Sn29 liquid alloy. The surface-segregation
extends up to three layers, in which the top layer is almost a pure monolayer
of Sn, the second layer is almost a pure monolayer of Au and the third layer
appears to be slightly enhanced in Au. Although the surface-segregation
concentration profiles can be qualitatively accounted for by the theories of
Defay-Prigogine and Strohl-King, they cannot satisfactorily account for the
measured surface tension.

Anomalous reflection and excitation of surface waves in metamaterials,"We consider reflection of electromagnetic waves from layered structures with
various dielectric and magnetic properties, including metamaterials. Assuming
periodic variations in the permittivity, we find that the reflection is in
general anomalous. In particular, we note that the specular reflection vanishes
and that the incident energy is totally reflected in the backward direction,
when the conditions for resonant excitation of leaking surface waves are
fulfilled.",2007-02-20T15:31:47Z
Making a splash with water repellency,"A 'splash' is usually heard when a solid body enters water at large velocity.
This phenomena originates from the formation of an air cavity resulting from
the complex transient dynamics of the free interface during the impact. The
classical picture of impacts on free surfaces relies solely on fluid inertia,
arguing that surface properties and viscous effects are negligible at
sufficiently large velocities. In strong contrast to this large-scale
hydrodynamic viewpoint, we demonstrate in this study that the wettability of
the impacting body is a key factor in determining the degree of splashing. This
unexpected result is illustrated in Fig.1: a large cavity is evident for an
impacting hydrophobic sphere (1.b), contrasting with the hydrophilic sphere's
impact under the very same conditions (1.a). This unforeseen fact is
furthermore embodied in the dependence of the threshold velocity for air
entrainment on the contact angle of the impacting body, as well as on the ratio
between the surface tension and fluid viscosity, thereby defining a critical
capillary velocity. As a paradigm, we show that superhydrophobic impacters make
a big 'splash' for any impact velocity. This novel understanding provides a new
perspective for impacts on free surfaces, and reveals that modifications of the
detailed nature of the surface -- involving physico-chemical aspects at the
nanometric scales -- provide an efficient and versatile strategy for
controlling the water entry of solid bodies at high velocity.",2007-01-05T07:39:32Z
Low temperature vortex liquid in $\rm La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$,"In the cuprates, the lightly-doped region is of major interest because
superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, and the pseudogap state
\cite{Timusk,Lee,Anderson} come together near a critical doping value $x_c$.
These states are deeply influenced by phase fluctuations \cite{Emery} which
lead to a vortex-liquid state that surrounds the superconducting region
\cite{WangPRB01,WangPRB06}. However, many questions
\cite{Doniach,Fisher,FisherLee,Tesanovic,Sachdev} related to the nature of the
transition and vortex-liquid state at very low tempera- tures $T$ remain open
because the diamagnetic signal is difficult to resolve in this region. Here, we
report torque magnetometry results on $\rm La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ (LSCO) which show
that superconductivity is lost at $x_c$ by quantum phase fluctuations. We find
that, in a magnetic field $H$, the vortex solid-to-liquid transition occurs at
field $H_m$ much lower than the depairing field $H_{c2}$. The vortex liquid
exists in the large field interval $H_m \ll H_{c2}$, even in the limit $T\to$0.
The resulting phase diagram reveals the large fraction of the $x$-$H$ plane
occupied by the quantum vortex liquid.",2007-02-05T23:16:26Z
Existence of two electronic states in Sr4Ru3O10 at low temperatures,"We report measurements on in-plane resistivity, thermopower, and
magnetization as a function of temperature and magnetic fields on single
crystalline Sr4Ru3O10 grown by the floating zone method. As the temperature was
lowered to below around 30 K, the in-plane and c-axis resistivities and the
thermopower were found to exhibit a step feature accompanied by hysteresis
behavior when the in-plane field was swept up and down from below 10 kOe to
above 20 kOe. The sharp increase in the thermopower with increasing in-plane
magnetic field at low temperatures has not been observed previously in layered
transition metal oxides. Comparing with magnetization data, we propose that the
step feature marks the transition between the two different electronic states
in Sr4Ru3O10. We propose that the alignment of domains by the in-plane magnetic
field is responsible to the emergence of the new electronic states in high
applied in-plane magnetic field.",2007-02-05T08:17:16Z
"High-Frequency Nanofluidics: An Experimental Study using Nanomechanical
  Resonators","Here we apply nanomechanical resonators to the study of oscillatory fluid
dynamics. A high-resonance-frequency nanomechanical resonator generates a
rapidly oscillating flow in a surrounding gaseous environment; the nature of
the flow is studied through the flow-resonator interaction. Over the broad
frequency and pressure range explored, we observe signs of a transition from
Newtonian to non-Newtonian flow at $\omega\tau\approx 1$, where $\tau$ is a
properly defined fluid relaxation time. The obtained experimental data appears
to be in close quantitative agreement with a theory that predicts purely
elastic fluid response as $\omega\tau\to \infty$.",2007-03-08T22:49:29Z
"Hubble Space Telescope Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of the Dwarf Nova VW
  Hyi in Superoutburst","We obtained three consecutive HST spectroscopic observations of a single
superoutburst of the dwarf nova VW Hydri. The spectra cover the beginning,
middle, and end of the superoutburst. All of the spectra are dominated by
strong absorption lines due to CIII (1175 \AA), Lyman alpha (1216 \AA), NIV
(1238 \AA, 1242 \AA), SII (1260-65 \AA), SIII (1300 \AA), CII (1335 \AA), SIV
(1394 \AA, 1402 \AA) and CIV (1548 \AA, 1550 \AA). We discuss the evolution of
the far UV energy distribution and line structure during the superoutburst. We
note the absence of any P Cygni line structure in the STIS spectra. Using state
of the art accretion disk models by Wade and Hubeny, we have determined
accretion rates for all three spectra, for two white dwarf masses, 0.55
M$_{\sun}$ and 0.8 M$-{\sun}$. For both white dwarf masses the accretion rate
during superoutburst decreased by a factor of two from early to late in the
superoutburst. The average accretion rate during superoutburst is $3 - 6 \times
10^{-9}$M$_{\sun}$/yr depending on the white dwarf mass.",2007-03-02T05:06:36Z
Excitons in coupled InAs/InP self-assembled quantum wires,"Optical transitions in coupled InAs/InP self-assembled quantum wires are
studied within the single-band effective mass approximation including effects
due to strain. Both vertically and horizontally coupled quantum wires are
investigated and the ground state, excited states and the photoluminescence
peak energies are calculated. Where possible we compare with available
photo-luminescence data from which it was possible to determine the height of
the quantum wires. An anti-crossing of the energy of excited states is found
for vertically coupled wires signaling a change of symmetry of the exciton
wavefunction. This crossing is the signature of two different coupling regimes.",2007-02-08T12:59:18Z
"Upper critical field divergence induced by mesoscopic phase separation
  in the organic superconductor (TMTSF)2ReO4","Due to the competition of two anion orders, (TMTSF)2ReO4, presents a phase
coexistence between semiconducting and metallic (superconducting) regions
(filaments or droplets) in a wide range of pressure. In this regime, the
superconducting upper critical field for H parallel to both c* and b' axes
present a linear part at low fields followed by a divergence above a cross-over
field. This cross-over corresponds to the 3D-2D decoupling transition expected
in filamentary or granular superconductors. The sharpness of the transition
also demonstrates that all filaments are of similar sizes and self organize in
a very ordered way. The distance between the filaments and their cross-section
are estimated.",2007-01-26T14:34:51Z
"Higher dimensional spacetimes with a geodesic, shearfree, twistfree and
  expanding null congruence","We present the complete family of higher dimensional spacetimes that admit a
geodesic, shearfree, twistfree and expanding null congruence, thus extending
the well-known D=4 class of Robinson-Trautman solutions. Einstein's equations
are solved for empty space with an arbitrary cosmological constant and for
aligned pure radiation. Main differences with respect to the D=4 case (such as
the absence of type III/N solutions, related to ``violations'' of the
Goldberg-Sachs theorem in D>4) are pointed out, also in connection with other
recent works. A formal analogy with electromagnetic fields is briefly discussed
in an appendix, where we demonstrate that multiple principal null directions of
null Maxwell fields are necessarily geodesic, and that in D>4 they are also
shearing if expanding.",2007-01-05T15:52:42Z
"Tunneling into a Fractional Quantum Hall System and the Infrared
  Catastrophe","We calculate the tunneling density of states of a two-dimensional interacting
electron gas in a quantizing magnetic field. We show that the observed
pseudogap in the density of states can be understood as the result of an
infrared catastrophe in a noninteracting electron model. This catastrophe stems
from the response of an electronic system to the potential produced by the
abruptly added charge during a tunneling event. Our formalism can be applied at
any filling factor without the use of Chern-Simons or composite fermion theory.",2007-02-09T11:27:53Z
Contrast in transmission spectroscopy of a single quantum dot,"We perform transmission spectroscopy on single quantum dots and examine the
effects of a resident carriers spin, the incident laser spot size,
polarization, and power on the experimental contrast. We demonstrate a factor
of 4 improvement in the maximum contrast by using a solid immersion lens to
decrease the spot area. This increase yields a maximum signal to noise ratio of
2000 Hz-1/2, which will allow for MHz detection frequencies. We anticipate that
this improvement will allow further investigation of spectral fluctuation and
open up the feasibility for an all-optical read-out of an electron spin in a
quantum dot.",2007-01-25T15:06:52Z
Emergence of Spin-Half Fermion Vortices and The Vortex Metal,"This paper has been withdrawn and replaced by a new version entitled ""Vortex
quantum dynamics of two dimensional lattice bosons"" By Netanel H. Lindner, Assa
Auerbach, Daniel P. Arovas, posted in arXiv:0810.2604. The calculations and
results of the original manuscript were correct, and lead to several important
conclusions about vortex dynamics and Hall conductance. However, we have
dropped our conjecture, that vortices exhibit mutual Fermi statistics. The
conjecture was based on the antisymmetry under exchange of two vortices, as
revealed in the lowest eight many-body eigenstates of 16 sites toroidal
lattices. Appealing to an effective Harper bosons model on larger lattices,
revealed vortex eigenstates with both Bose and Fermi permutation symmetries,
although vortices do carry spin half quantum numbers. It may exemplify that a

Zeno and anti-Zeno dynamics in spin-bath models,"We investigate the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in spin bath models:
the spin-boson model and a spin-fermion model. We show that the Zeno-anti-Zeno
transition is critically controlled by the system-bath coupling parameter, the
same parameter that determines spin decoherence rate. We also discuss the
crossover in a biased system, at high temperatures, and for a nonequilibrium
spin-fermion system, manifesting the counteracting roles of electrical bias,
temperature, and magnetic field on the spin decoherence rate.",2007-01-26T15:11:26Z
"On the Correlation of Geographic and Network Proximity at Internet Edges
  and its Implications for Mobile Unicast and Multicast Routing","Significant effort has been invested recently to accelerate handover
operations in a next generation mobile Internet. Corresponding works for
developing efficient mobile multicast management are emergent. Both problems
simultaneously expose routing complexity between subsequent points of
attachment as a characteristic parameter for handover performance in access
networks.
  As continuous mobility handovers necessarily occur between access routers
located in geographic vicinity, this paper investigates on the hypothesis that
geographically adjacent edge networks attain a reduced network distances as
compared to arbitrary Internet nodes. We therefore evaluate and analyze edge
distance distributions in various regions for clustered IP ranges on their
geographic location such as a city. We use traceroute to collect packet
forwarding path and round-trip-time of each intermediate node to scan-wise
derive an upper bound of the node distances. Results of different scanning
origins are compared to obtain the best estimation of network distance of each
pair. Our results are compared with corresponding analysis of CAIDA Skitter
data, overall leading to fairly stable, reproducible edge distance
distributions. As a first conclusion on expected impact on handover performance
measures, our results indicate a general optimum for handover anticipation time
in 802.11 networks of 25 ms.",2007-01-20T23:06:57Z
Mottness,"We review several of the normal state properties of the cuprates in an
attempt to establish an organizing principle from which pseudogap phenomena,
broad spectral features, $T-$linear resistivity, and spectral weight transfer
emerge. We first show that standard field theories with a single critical
length scale cannot capture the $T-$linear resistivity as long as the charge
carriers are critical. What seems to be missing is an additional length scale,
which may or may not be critical. Second, we prove a generalised version of
Luttinger's theorem for a Mott insulator. Namely, regardless of the spatial
dimension, the Fermi surface of the non-interacting system is converted into a
surface of zeros of the single-particle Green function when the Mott insulator
posesses particle-hole symmetry. Only in the presence of particle-hole symmetry
does the volume of the surface of zeros equal the particle density. The surface
of zeros persists at finite doping and is shown to provide a framework from
which pseudogaps, broad spectral features, spectral weight transfer on the Mott
gap scale can be understood.",2007-02-14T23:49:04Z
Fluctuation theorems for harmonic oscillators,"We study experimentally the thermal fluctuations of energy input and
dissipation in a harmonic oscillator driven out of equilibrium, and search for
Fluctuation Relations. We study transient evolution from the equilibrium state,
together with non equilibrium steady states. Fluctuations Relations are
obtained experimentally for both the work and the heat, for the stationary and
transient evolutions. A Stationary State Fluctuation Theorem is verified for
the two time prescriptions of the torque. But a Transient Fluctuation Theorem
is satisfied for the work given to the system but not for the heat dissipated
by the system in the case of linear forcing. Experimental observations on the
statistical and dynamical properties of the fluctuation of the angle, we derive
analytical expressions for the probability density function of the work and the
heat. We obtain for the first time an analytic expression of the probability
density function of the heat. Agreement between experiments and our modeling is
excellent.",2007-03-30T07:21:21Z
"Very Large Excesses of 18O in Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon and R Coronae
  Borealis Stars: Evidence for White Dwarf Mergers","We have found that at least seven hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) and R
Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars, have 16O/18O ratios close to and in some cases
less than unity, values that are orders of magnitude lower than measured in
other stars (the Solar value is 500). Greatly enhanced 18O is evident in every
HdC and RCB we have measured that is cool enough to have detectable CO bands.
The three HdC stars measured have 16O/18O < 1, lower values than any of the RCB
stars. These discoveries are important clues in determining the evolutionary
pathways of HdC and RCB stars, for which two models have been proposed: the
double degenerate (white dwarf (WD) merger), and the final helium-shell flash
(FF). No overproduction of 18O is expected in the FF scenario. We have
quantitatively explored the idea that HdC and RCB stars originate in the
mergers of CO- and He-WDs. The merger process is estimated to take only a few
days, with accretion rates of 150 Msun/ yr producing temperatures at the base
of the accreted envelope of 1.2 - 1.9 x 10^8 K. Analysis of a simplified
one-zone calculation shows that nucleosynthesis in the dynamically accreting
material may provide a suitable environment for a significant production of
18O, leading to very low values of 16O/18O, similar to those observed. We also
find qualitative agreement with observed values of 12C/13C and with the CNO
elemental ratios. H-admixture during the accretion process from the small
H-rich C/O WD envelope may play an important role in producing the observed
abundances. Overall our analysis shows that WD mergers may very well be the
progenitors of O18-rich RCB and HdC stars, and that more detailed simulations
and modeling are justified.",2007-03-16T18:16:26Z
"A longer XMM-Newton look at I Zwicky 1: Distinct modes of X-ray spectral
  variability","The short-term spectral variability of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy I
Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1) as observed in an 85 ks XMM-Newton observation is discussed
in detail. I Zw 1 shows distinct modes of variability prior to and after a flux
dip in the broad-band light curve. Before the dip the variability can be
described as arising from changes in shape and normalisation of the spectral
components. Only changes in normalisation are manifested after the dip. The
change in the mode of behaviour occurs on dynamically short timescales in I Zw
1. The data suggest that the accretion-disc corona in I Zw 1 could have two
components that are co-existing. The first, a uniform, physically diffuse
plasma responsible for the ""typical'' long-term (e.g. years) behaviour; and a
second compact, centrally located component causing the rapid flux and spectral
changes. This compact component could be the base of a short or aborted jet as
sometimes proposed for radio-quiet active galaxies. Modelling of the average
and time-resolved rms spectra demonstrate that a blurred Compton-reflection
model can describe the spectral variability if we allow for pivoting of the
continuum component prior to the dip.",2007-03-14T13:38:51Z
Effects of Galaxy Formation on Thermodynamics of the Intracluster Medium,"We present detailed comparisons of the intracluster medium (ICM) in
cosmological Eulerian cluster simulations with deep Chandra observations of
nearby relaxed clusters. To assess the impact of galaxy formation, we compare
two sets of simulations, one performed in the non-radiative regime and another
with radiative cooling and several physical processes critical to various
aspects of galaxy formation: star formation, metal enrichment and stellar
feedback. We show that the observed ICM properties outside cluster cores are
well-reproduced in the simulations that include cooling and star formation,
while the non-radiative simulations predict an overall shape of the ICM
profiles inconsistent with observations. In particular, we find that the ICM
entropy in our runs with cooling is enhanced to the observed levels at radii as
large as half of the virial radius. We also find that outside cluster cores
entropy scaling with the mean ICM temperature in both simulations and Chandra
observations is consistent with being self-similar within current error bars.
We find that the pressure profiles of simulated clusters are also close to
self-similar and exhibit little cluster-to-cluster scatter. The X-ray
observable-total mass relations for our simulated sample agree with the Chandra
measurements to \~10%-20% in normalization. We show that this systematic
difference could be caused by the subsonic gas motions, unaccounted for in
X-ray hydrostatic mass estimates. The much improved agreement of simulations
and observations in the ICM profiles and scaling relations is encouraging and
the existence of tight relations of X-ray observables, such as Yx, and total
cluster mass and the simple redshift evolution of these relations hold promise
for the use of clusters as cosmological probes.",2007-03-26T20:21:38Z
"Star formation efficiency in galaxy interactions and mergers: a
  statistical study","We investigate the enhancement of star formation efficiency in galaxy
interactions and mergers, by numerical simulations of several hundred galaxy
collisions. All morphological types along the Hubble sequence are considered in
the initial conditions of the two colliding galaxies, with varying
bulge-to-disk ratios and gas mass fractions. Different types of orbits are
simulated, direct and retrograde, according to the initial relative energy and
impact parameter, and the resulting star formation history is compared to that
occuring in the two galaxies when they are isolated. Our principal results are:
(1) retrograde encounters have a larger star formation efficiency (SFE) than
direct encounters; (2) the amount of gas available in the galaxy is not the
main parameter governing the SFE in the burst phase; (3) there is an
anticorrelation between the amplitude of the star forming burst and the tidal
forces exerted per unit of time, which is due to the large amount of gas
dragged outside the galaxy by tidal tails in strong interactions; (4) globally,
the Kennicutt-Schmidt law is retrieved statistically for isolated galaxies,
interacting pairs and mergers; (5) the enhanced star formation is essentially
occurring in nuclear starbursts, triggered by inward gas flows driven by
non-axisymmetries in the galaxy disks. Direct encounters develop more
pronounced asymmetries than retrograde ones. Based on these statistical
results, we derive general laws for the enhancement of star formation in galaxy
interactions and mergers, as a function of the main parameters of the
encounter.",2007-03-09T16:25:22Z
"Relaxation mechanism for electron spin in the impurity band of n-doped
  semiconductors","We propose a mechanism to describe spin relaxation in n-doped III-V
semiconductors close to the Mott metal-insulator transition. Taking into
account the spin-orbit interaction induced spin admixture in the hydrogenic
donor states, we build a tight-binding model for the spin-dependent impurity
band. Since the hopping amplitudes with spin flip are considerably smaller than
the spin conserving counterparts, the resulting spin lifetime is very large. We
estimate the spin lifetime from the diffusive accumulation of spin rotations
associated with the electron hopping. Our result is larger but of the same
order of magnitude than the experimental value. Therefore the proposed
mechanism has to be included when describing spin relaxation in the impurity
band.",2007-01-15T12:05:31Z
"Charge and spin excitation spectra in the one-dimensional Hubbard model
  with next-nearest-neighbor hopping","The dynamical density-matrix renormalization group technique is used to
calculate spin and charge excitation spectra in the one-dimensional (1D)
Hubbard model at quarter filling with nearest-neighbor $t$ and
next-nearest-neighbor $t'$ hopping integrals. We consider a case where $t$
($>0$) is much smaller than $t'$ ($>0$). We find that the spin and charge
excitation spectra come from the two nearly independent $t'$-chains and are
basically the same as those of the 1D Hubbard (and t-J) chain at quarter
filling. However, we find that the hopping integral $t$ plays a crucial role in
the short-range spin and charge correlations; i.e., the ferromagnetic spin
correlations between electrons on the neighboring sites is enhanced and
simultaneously the spin-triplet pairing correlations is induced, of which the
consequences are clearly seen in the calculated spin and charge excitation
spectra at low energies.",2007-01-24T05:48:22Z
Resonant switching using spin valves,"Using micromagnetics we demonstrate that the r.f. field produced by a spin
valve can be used to reverse the magnetization in a magnetic nanoparticle. The
r.f. field is generated using a current that specifically excites a uniform
spin wave in the spin valve. This current is swept such that the
chirped-frequency generated by the valve matches the angular dependent resonant
frequency of the anisotropy-dominated magnetic nanoparticle, as a result of
which the magnetization reversal occurs. The switching is fast, requires
currents similar to those used in recent experiments with spin valves, and is
stable with respect to small perturbations. This phenomenon can potentially be
employed in magnetic information storage devices or recently discussed magnetic
computing schemes.",2007-03-11T04:46:23Z
Recoil Velocities from Equal-Mass Binary-Black-Hole Mergers,"The final evolution of a binary black-hole system gives rise to a recoil
velocity if an asymmetry is present in the emitted gravitational radiation.
Measurements of this effect for non-spinning binaries with unequal masses have
pointed out that kick velocities $\sim~175$ km/s can be reached for a mass
ratio $\simeq 0.36$. However, a larger recoil can be obtained for equal-mass
binaries if the asymmetry is provided by the spins. Using two independent
methods we show that the merger of such binaries yields velocities as large as
$\sim 440$ km/s for black holes having unequal spins that are antialigned and
parallel to the orbital angular momentum.",2007-01-29T20:19:17Z

Preferential Behaviour and Scaling in Diffusive Dynamics on Networks,"We study the fluctuation properties and return-time statistics on
inhomogeneous scale-free networks using packets moving with two different
dynamical rules; random diffusion and locally navigated diffusive motion with
preferred edges. Scaling in the fluctuations occurs when the dispersion of a
quantity at each node or edge increases like the its mean to the power $\mu$.
We show that the occurrence of scaling in the fluctuations of both the number
of packets passing nodes and the number flowing along edges is related to
preferential behaviour in either the topology (in the case of nodes) or in the
dynamics (in case the of edges). Within our model the absence of any preference
leads to the absence of scaling, and when scaling occurs it is non-universal;
for random diffusion the number of packets passing a node scales with an
exponent $\mu$ which increases continuously with increased acquisition time
window from $\mu =1/2$ at small windows, to $\mu =1$ at long time windows; In
the preferentially navigated diffusive motion, busy nodes and edges have
exponent $\mu =1$, in contrast to less busy parts of the network, where an
exponent $\mu =1/2$ is found. Broad distributions of the return times at nodes
and edges illustrate that the basis of the observed scaling is the cooperative
behaviour between groups of nodes or edges. These conclusions are relevant for
a large class of diffusive dynamics on networks, including packet transport
with local navigation rules.",2007-01-31T16:36:00Z
"Langevin Approach to Fractional Diffusion Equations including Inertial

Kramers-Fokker-Planck equation have been presented. Using an idea of Fogedby

equations are related to Langevin equations via the procedure of subordination.",2007-03-27T12:55:19Z
Dynamical control of electron spin coherence in a quantum dot,"We investigate the performance of dynamical decoupling methods at suppressing
electron spin decoherence from a low-temperature nuclear spin reservoir in a
quantum dot. The controlled dynamics is studied through exact numerical
simulation, with emphasis on realistic pulse delays and long-time limit. Our
results show that optimal performance for this system is attained by a periodic
protocol exploiting concatenated design, with control rates substantially
slower than expected from the upper spectral cutoff of the bath. For a known
initial electron spin state, coherence can saturate at long times, signaling
the creation of a stable ``spin-locked'' decoherence-free subspace. Analytical
insight on saturation is obtained for a simple echo protocol, in good agreement
with numerical results.",2007-01-21T17:27:52Z
Supersymmetry Approach to Almost Diagonal Random Matrices,"We develop a supersymmetric field theoretical description of the Gaussian
ensemble of the almost diagonal Hermitian Random Matrices. The matrices have
independent random entries H_{ij} with parametrically small off-diagonal
elements H_{ij}/H_{ii} ~ B << 1. We derive a regular virial expansion of
correlation functions in the number of ``interacting'' supermatrices associated
with different sites in the real space and demonstrate that the perturbation
theory constructed in this way is controlled by a small parameter B. General
form of the integral expression for the m-th virial coefficient governed by the
``interaction'' of m supermatrices is presented and calculated explicitly in
the cases of 2- and 3-matrix ``interaction''. The suggested technique allows us
to calculate both the spectral correlations and the correlations of the
eigenfunctions taken at different energies and in different space points.",2007-01-18T11:58:15Z
Size-dependent melting of spherical copper nanoparticles,"We report size-dependent melting of spherical copper nanoparticles embedded
into silica matrix. Based on the temperature dependence of the surface plasmon
resonance energy and its width we observe two distinct melting regimes. For
particles smaller than 20 nm the absorption spectrum changes monotonically with
the temperature, and this allows us to assume the gradual solid-liquid phase
transition (melting) of the nanoparticles or existence of superheated solid
nanoparticles. In contrast, for nanoparticles larger than 20 nm, we observe a
jump-like increase of the bandwidth and non-monotonic dependence of surface
plasmon energy at the temperatures below the bulk melting point. This indicates
that the melting of large nanoparticles is a first-order phase transition
similar to the melting of bulk copper.",2007-01-12T13:50:30Z
"Thermal regimes of HTS cylinders operating in devices for fault current
  limitation","We reveal obstacles related to the application of HTS cylinders in current
limiting devices based on the superconducting - normal state transition. It is
shown that, at the critical current density achieved presently in bulk
materials, and especially in BSCCO-2212, the required thickness of the cylinder
wall in a full-scale inductive device achieves several centimeters. A simple
mathematical model of the operation of an inductive fault current limiter (FCL)
is used to show that such cylinders cannot be cooled in admissible time after a
fault clearing and, hence, the inductive FCLs and current-limiting transformers
employing BSCCO cylinders do not return to the normal operation in the time
required. For the recovery even with a non-current pause in the circuit, the
cylinders are needed with the critical current density by an order higher than
the existed ones.",2007-02-05T15:05:54Z
"Use of real-time Fourier Transform Infrared Reflectivity as an in situ

rate E-beam evaporation/deposition of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO). The results demonstrate
the great utility of FTIR as an in situ monitor of YBCO deposition and
processing. We detect different (amorphous/fine polycrystalline) insulating
pre-existing phases to the high Tc superconducting phase which appear to have
distinct reflectivity fingerprints dominated by thin film interference effects,
as a function of temperature and oxygen pressure. These fingerprints reveal
some of the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways during the growth of YBCO.",2007-01-18T19:23:21Z
"Spitzer Space Telescope Observations of Kepler's Supernova Remnant: A
  Detailed Look at the Circumstellar Dust Component","We present 3.6 - 160 micron infrared images of Kepler's supernova remnant
(SN1604) obtained with the IRAC and MIPS instruments on the Spitzer Space
Telescope. We also present MIPS SED low resolution spectra in the 55 - 95
micron region. The observed emission in the MIPS 24 micron band shows the
entire shell. Emission in the MIPS 70 micron and IRAC 8 micron bands is seen
only from the brightest regions of 24 micron emission, which also correspond to
the regions seen in optical Halpha images. Shorter wavelength IRAC images are
increasingly dominated by stars, although faint filaments are discernible. The
SED spectrum of shows a faint continuum dropping off to longer wavelengths and
confirms that strong line emission does not dominate the mid-IR spectral
region. The emission we see is due primarily to warm dust emission from dust
heated by the primary blast wave; no excess infrared emission is observed in
regions where supernova ejecta are seen in X-rays. We use models of the dust to
interpret the observed 70/24 micron ratio and constrain the allowed range of
temperatures and densities. We estimate the current mass of dust in the warm
dust component to be 5.4 x 10^{-4} solar masses, and infer an original mass of
about 3 x 10^{-3} solar masses before grain sputtering. The MIPS 160 micron
band shows no emission belonging to the remnant. We place a conservative but
temperature dependent upper limit on any cold dust component roughly a factor
of 10 below the cold dust mass inferred from SCUBA observations. Finally, we
comment on issues relevant to the possible precursor star and the supernova
type.",2007-03-26T19:45:53Z

Projected single-spin flip dynamics in the Ising Model,"We study transition matrices for projected dynamics in the
energy-magnetization space, magnetization space and energy space. Several
single spin flip dynamics are considered such as the Glauber and Metropolis
canonical ensemble dynamics and the Metropolis dynamics for three
multicanonical ensembles: the flat energy-magnetization histogram, the flat
energy histogram and the flat magnetization histogram. From the numerical
diagonalization of the matrices for the projected dynamics we obtain the
sub-dominant eigenvalue and the largest relaxation times for systems of varying
size. Although, the projected dynamics is an approximation to the full state
space dynamics comparison with some available results, obtained by other
authors, shows that projection in the magnetization space is a reasonably
accurate method to study the scaling of relaxation times with system size. The
transition matrices for arbitrary single-spin flip dynamics are obtained from a
single Monte-Carlo estimate of the infinite temperature transition-matrix, for
each system size, which makes the method an efficient tool to evaluate the
relative performance of any arbitrary local spin-flip dynamics. We also present
new results for appropriately defined average tunnelling times of magnetization
and compute their finite-size scaling exponents that we compare with results of
energy tunnelling exponents available for the flat energy histogram
multicanonical ensemble.",2007-01-17T11:20:32Z
"Single Molecule Spectroscopy as a possible tool to study the electric
  field in superconductors","We discuss the influence of the superconducting transition in a film on the
fluorescence spectrum of a single molecule located nearby. We show that single
molecule spectroscopy (SMS) should be an appropriate tool to detect the
electric charge associated with a vortex line. Also we argue that an electric
field must appear at the boundaries between normal and superconducting regions
of the intermediate phase and SMS could be useful to study this effect.",2007-01-05T12:08:46Z
"Algorithms for 3D rigidity analysis and a first order percolation
  transition","A fast computer algorithm, the pebble game, has been used successfully to
study rigidity percolation on 2D elastic networks, as well as on a special
class of 3D networks, the bond-bending networks. Application of the pebble game
approach to general 3D networks has been hindered by the fact that the
underlying mathematical theory is, strictly speaking, invalid in this case. We
construct an approximate pebble game algorithm for general 3D networks, as well
as a slower but exact algorithm, the relaxation algorithm, that we use for
testing the new pebble game. Based on the results of these tests and additional
considerations, we argue that in the particular case of randomly diluted
central-force networks on BCC and FCC lattices, the pebble game is essentially
exact. Using the pebble game, we observe an extremely sharp jump in the largest
rigid cluster size in bond-diluted central-force networks in 3D, with the
percolating cluster appearing and taking up most of the network after a single
bond addition. This strongly suggests a first order rigidity percolation
transition, which is in contrast to the second order transitions found
previously for the 2D central-force and 3D bond-bending networks. While a first
order rigidity transition has been observed for Bethe lattices and networks
with ``chemical order'', this is the first time it has been seen for a regular
randomly diluted network. In the case of site dilution, the transition is also
first order for BCC, but results for FCC suggest a second order transition.
Even in bond-diluted lattices, while the transition appears massively first
order in the order parameter (the percolating cluster size), it is continuous
in the elastic moduli. This, and the apparent non-universality, make this phase
transition highly unusual.",2007-02-27T10:11:34Z
"Impurity resonant state in d-wave superconductors: in favor of a
  Kondo-like response","We investigate the impurity resonant state induced by non-magnetic impurities
in d-wave cuprate superconductors in two different impurity models: (i) in a
pure potential scattering model within the T-matrix approach and (ii) in a
Bose-Fermi Kondo model within the large-N formalism. We modify the
superconducting host to resemble the nanoscale electronic inhomogeneities seen
in the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) spectra (i.e., the small- and
large-gap domains) and study how this influences the impurity resonance. In the
pure potential scattering model the resonant state is found to be a rather
robust feature appearing in all host domains. On the other hand, in the
Kondo-like model the impurity resonance can appear in the small-gap regions of
the host and be completely suppressed in the large-gap regions; this is in
agreement with the STM experimental data for Zn-doped BSCCO. Our results imply
that the Kondo spin dynamics of the impurity moment is the origin of the
impurity resonant state in d-wave superconductors, rather than the pure
potential scattering.",2007-02-20T11:22:24Z

any k, we also construct planar n-point sets for which any geometric graph with

the points of S are required to be in convex position.",2007-02-14T03:46:54Z
"Fermi-liquid approach for description of initial stage of fragmentation
  at heavy nuclei collisions","A mechanism is proposed for initial stage of instability development that can
induce the fragmentation of nuclear matter, arising as a result of collisions
of non-relativistic heavy nuclei. Collision of heavy nuclei is simulated as a
collision of two unbounded Fermi-liquid ``drops''. The instability origination
in such a system is related to propagation of increasing oscillations in the
nuclear matter. These oscillations can exist in a resting Fermi-liquid:
modified Landau zero sound, modified spin and isospin waves, combination of
these more simple waves. These instabilities are analogous to the beam
instability in ordinary electron plasma. Behavior features of the obtained
oscillation increase increments are provided. They can be used as indication
for experimental confirmation of the proposed mechanism of fragmentation at
nuclear collisions. Directions along which nuclear matter ``jets'' can be
expected are specified.",2007-03-17T16:58:58Z
"Two dimensional curved disks on a sphere: the evolution of kinetic

the curvature of the sphere and interact via a simplified Hertz law. We analyze
the behavior of the total kinetic energy of the whole assembly of disks with
Riemanian geometry and contrarily to flat spaces, this kinetic energy
increases. This is due to a non radial component of the resulting velocity
vector at each interaction between two disks. The study of granular matter in

Linear time algorithms for Clobber,"We prove that the single-player game clobber is solvable in linear time when

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study of Ultrananocrystalline Diamonds,"We report on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of ultrananocrystalline
diamond (UNCD) materials produced by detonation technique. Analysis of the 13C
and 1H NMR spectra, spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation times in purified
UNCD samples is presented. Our measurements show that UNCD particles consist of
a diamond core that is partially covered by a sp2-carbon fullerene-like shell.
The uncovered part of outer diamond surface comprises a number of hydrocarbon
groups that saturate the dangling bonds. Our findings are discussed along with
recent calculations of the UNCD structure. Significant increase in the
spin-lattice relaxation rate (in comparison with that of natural diamond), as
well as stretched exponential character of the magnetization recovery, are
attributed to the interaction of nuclear spins with paramagnetic centers which
are likely fabrication-driven dangling bonds with unpaired electrons. We show
that these centers are located mainly at the interface between the diamond core
and shell.",2007-01-31T09:58:48Z
Weak localisation in bilayer graphene,"We have performed the first experimental investigation of quantum

negative magnetoresistance - a signature of weak localisation - is observed at
different carrier densities, including the electro-neutrality region. It is
very different, however, from the weak localisation in conventional
two-dimensional systems. We show that it is controlled not only by the
dephasing time, but also by different elastic processes that break the

On the existence of stationary states during granular compaction,"When submitted to gentle mechanical taps a granular packing slowly compacts

Ferroelectricity of Ice Nanotubes inside Carbon Nanotubes,"We report that ice nanotubes with odd number of side faces inside carbon

A Systematic Approach to Web-Application Development,"Designing a web-application from a specification involves a series of

superconducting state below a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Thus,

conventional tensile machine while a special device was designed to perform
stress-driven experiments. Significant differences in the hysteresis loops were
found. The strain-driven curves show re-entrant behaviour (yield point) which

"Calculations of giant magnetoresistance in Fe/Cr trilayers using layer

where n is the number of Fe monolayers. The thickness of the transition-metal
ferromagnet has been ranged from $n=1$ up to n=8 while the spacer thickness was
fixed to 3 monolayers. The calculated potentials were inserted in the

explicit numerical and analytical investigations of noninteracting gases. Thus,
the Schrodinger equation is used instead of the Gross-Pitaevski equation.
Calculating the atomic density, chemical potential, critical temperature and

"Overcoming Hierarchical Difficulty by Hill-Climbing the Building Block
  Structure","The Building Block Hypothesis suggests that Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are
well-suited for hierarchical problems, where efficient solving requires proper
problem decomposition and assembly of solution from sub-solution with strong
non-linear interdependencies. The paper proposes a hill-climber operating over
the building block (BB) space that can efficiently address hierarchical
problems. The new Building Block Hill-Climber (BBHC) uses past hill-climb
experience to extract BB information and adapts its neighborhood structure
accordingly. The perpetual adaptation of the neighborhood structure allows the
method to climb the hierarchical structure solving successively the
hierarchical levels. It is expected that for fully non deceptive hierarchical
BB structures the BBHC can solve hierarchical problems in linearithmic time.
Empirical results confirm that the proposed method scales almost linearly with
the problem size thus clearly outperforms population based recombinative
methods.",2007-02-16T21:47:04Z
"The LMC's Top 250: Classification of the Most Luminous Compact 8 micron
  Sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud","To ascertain the nature of the brightest compact mid-infrared sources in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we have applied an updated version of the
Buchanan et al. (2006) 2MASS-MSX color classification system, which is based on
the results of Spitzer Space Telescope spectroscopy, to a mid-infrared (8
micron) flux-limited sample of 250 LMC objects for which 2MASS and MSX
photometry is available. The resulting 2MASS-MSX (""JHK8"") color-based
classifications of these sources, which constitute the most mid-IR-luminous
objects in the LMC, were augmented, cross-checked, and corrected where
necessary via a variety of independent means, such that only 47 sources retain
tentative classifications and only 10 sources cannot be classified at all. The
sample is found to consist primarily of carbon-rich AGB stars (~35%), red
supergiants (~18%), and compact H II regions (~30%), with additional, small
populations of oxygen-rich AGB stars (~4%), dusty, early-type emission-line
stars (~3%), and foreground, O-rich AGB stars in the Milky Way (~3%). The very
large ratio of C-rich to O-rich objects among the luminous and heavily
dust-enshrouded AGB stars in our LMC IR source sample is consistent with the
hypothesis that carbon stars form easily in lower metallicity environments. We
demonstrate that very luminous C-rich and O-rich AGB stars and red supergiants,
identified here primarily on the basis of their JHK8 colors, also appear as
distinct clusters in Spitzer IRAC/MIPS color-color diagrams. Thus, in
principle, the IRS-based IR photometric classification techniques applied here
to the LMC can be applied to any external galaxy whose most luminous IR point
sources are detectable and resolvable by 2MASS and Spitzer.",2007-03-22T14:16:26Z
"Investigation of the Tunneling Spectra in HgBr2-Intercalated Bi-2212
  Single Crystals below and above Tc","Interlayer tunneling spectroscopy measurements were performed on mesa arrays
of Bi-2212 single crystals, intercalated with HgBr$_2$. Tunneling conductances
were obtained over a wide temperature range to examine the spectral features,
especially the behavior of the quasiparticle peaks corresponding to
superconducting energy gaps (SGs). Experimental spectra showed that gap-like
features are still present even for the temperatures far above the transition
temperature, T$_c$. This evidence is consistent with the idea that the SG

Hierarchical Rigidity from Pair Distance Fluctuations,"Often, experiments, observations or simulations generate large numbers of
snapshots of the configurations of complex many-particle systems. It is
important to find methods of extracting useful information from these ensembles
of snapshots in order to document the motion as the system evolves. The most
interesting information is contained in the correlated motions of individual
constituents rather than in their absolute motion. We present a statistical
method to identify hierarchies of correlated motions from a series of two or
more snapshot configurations. This method is demonstrated in a number of
systems, including freely-jointed polymer chains, hard plastic spheres, water,
and proteins. These concepts are implemented as TIMME, the Tool for Identifying
Mobility in Macromolecular Ensembles.",2007-03-19T04:56:38Z
"Electronic structure and the minimum conductance of a graphene layer on
  SiO2 from density-functional methods.","The effect of the SiO$_2$ substrate on a graphene film is investigated using
realistic but computationally convenient energy-optimized models of the
substrate supporting a layer of graphene. The electronic bands are calculated
using density-functional methods for several model substrates. This provides an
estimate of the substrate-charge effects on the behaviour of the bands near
$E_F$, as well as a variation of the equilibrium distance of the graphene
sheet. A model of a wavy graphene layer is examined as a possible candidate for
understanding the nature of the minimally conducting states in graphene.",2007-03-03T18:55:43Z
Robustness of adiabatic passage trough a quantum phase transition,"We analyze the crossing of a quantum critical point based on exact results
for the transverse XY model. In dependence of the change rate of the driving
field, the evolution of the ground state is studied while the transverse
magnetic field is tuned through the critical point with a linear ramping. The
excitation probability is obtained exactly and is compared to previous studies
and to the Landau-Zener formula, a long time solution for non-adiabatic
transitions in two-level systems. The exact time dependence of the excitations
density in the system allows to identify the adiabatic and diabatic regions
during the sweep and to study the mesoscopic fluctuations of the excitations.
The effect of white noise is investigated, where the critical point transmutes
into a non-hermitian ``degenerate region''. Besides an overall increase of the
excitations during and at the end of the sweep, the most destructive effect of
the noise is the decay of the state purity that is enhanced by the passage
through the degenerate region.",2007-02-01T14:20:17Z
"Transverse Averaging Technique for Depletion Capacitance of Nonuniform
  PN-Junctions","This article evolves an analytical theory of nonuniform $PN$-junctions by
employing the transverse averaging technique (TAT) to reduce the
three-dimensional semiconductor equations to the quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) form involving all physical quantities as averaged over the
longitudinally-varying cross section $S(z)$. Solution of the quasi-1D Poisson's
equation shows that, besides the usual depletion capacitance $C_p$ and $C_n$
due to the $p$- and $n$-layers, there is an additional capacitance $C_s$
produced by nonuniformity of the cross-section area $S(z)$. The general
expressions derived yield the particular formulas obtained previously for the
abrupt and linearly-graded junctions with uniform cross-section. The quasi-1D
theory of nonuniform structures is demonstrated by applying the general
formulas to the $PN$-junctions of exponentially-varying cross section
$S(z)=S_0\exp(\alpha z)$ as most universal and applicable to any polynomial
approximation $S(z)\simeq S_0(1+\alpha z)^n$.",2007-01-23T14:02:20Z
Quantum Impurity Entanglement,"Entanglement in J_1-J_2, S=1/2 quantum spin chains with an impurity is
studied using analytic methods as well as large scale numerical density matrix
renormalization group methods. The entanglement is investigated in terms of the
von Neumann entropy, S=-Tr rho_A log rho_A, for a sub-system A of size r of the
chain. The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement
entropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_2 <=
J_2^c, as well as the dimerized phase, J_2>J_2^c, of the model. This quantum
impurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model
and it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in
the gapless phase, J_2 <= J_2^c, gives rise to a large length scale, xi_K,
associated with the screening of the impurity, the size of the Kondo screening
cloud. The universality of Kondo physics then implies scaling of the form
S_{imp}(r/xi_K,r/R) for a system of size R. Numerical results are presented
clearly demonstrating this scaling. At the critical point, J_2^c, an analytic
Fermi liquid picture is developed and analytic results are obtained both at T=0
and T>0. In the dimerized phase an appealing picure of the entanglement is
developed in terms of a thin soliton (TS) ansatz and the notions of impurity
valence bonds (IVB) and single particle entanglement (SPE) are introduced. The
TS-ansatz permits a variational calculation of the complete entanglement in the
dimerized phase that appears to be exact in the thermodynamic limit at the
Majumdar-Ghosh point, J_2=J_1/2, and surprisingly precise even close to the
critical point J_2^c. In appendices the relation between the finite temperature
entanglement entropy, S(T), and the thermal entropy, S_{th}(T), is discussed
and <S^z_r> and <S_r S_{r+1}> calculated at the MG-point using the TS-ansatz.",2007-03-02T03:55:42Z
"Nonpolar resistance switching of metal/binary-transition-metal
  oxides/metal sandwiches: homogeneous/inhomogeneous transition of current
  distribution","Exotic features of a metal/oxide/metal (MOM) sandwich, which will be the
basis for a drastically innovative nonvolatile memory device, is brought to
light from a physical point of view. Here the insulator is one of the
ubiquitous and classic binary-transition-metal oxides (TMO), such as Fe2O3,
NiO, and CoO. The sandwich exhibits a resistance that reversibly switches
between two states: one is a highly resistive off-state and the other is a
conductive on-state. Several distinct features were universally observed in
these binary TMO sandwiches: namely, nonpolar switching, non-volatile threshold
switching, and current--voltage duality. From the systematic sample-size
dependence of the resistance in on- and off-states, we conclude that the
resistance switching is due to the homogeneous/inhomogeneous transition of the
current distribution at the interface.",2007-02-26T07:13:34Z
Stokes Profile Inversion in Meso-Structured Magnetic Atmospheres,"Based on the Meso-Structured Magnetic Atmosphere (MESMA) approximation,
recently introduced by Carroll & Kopf (2007), we present first results of an
inversion of spectropolarimetric observations obtained from solar internetwork
regions. To cope with the inherent complexity of the mostly unresolved magnetic
field in the solar photosphere the MESMA approach provides a statistical
description of the underlying atmosphere in terms of a random Markov field.
This statistical model allows us to derive a stochastic transfer equation for
polarized light. The stochastic transfer equation explicitly accounts for the
spatial correlation -- the characteristic length scale -- of the underlying
magnetic and non-magnetic structures. We use this new diagnostic parameter in
an inversion approach to demonstrate that the magnetic flux structures in the
solar internetwork possess a finite correlation length which is not compatible
with the classical flux tube picture.",2007-03-13T17:45:45Z
"Prediction of the functional properties of ceramic materials from
  composition using artificial neural networks","We describe the development of artificial neural networks (ANN) for the
prediction of the properties of ceramic materials. The ceramics studied here
include polycrystalline, inorganic, non-metallic materials and are investigated
on the basis of their dielectric and ionic properties. Dielectric materials are
of interest in telecommunication applications where they are used in tuning and
filtering equipment. Ionic and mixed conductors are the subjects of a concerted
effort in the search for new materials that can be incorporated into efficient,
clean electrochemical devices of interest in energy production and greenhouse
gas reduction applications. Multi-layer perceptron ANNs are trained using the
back-propagation algorithm and utilise data obtained from the literature to
learn composition-property relationships between the inputs and outputs of the
system. The trained networks use compositional information to predict the
relative permittivity and oxygen diffusion properties of ceramic materials. The
results show that ANNs are able to produce accurate predictions of the
properties of these ceramic materials which can be used to develop materials
suitable for use in telecommunication and energy production applications.",2007-03-08T13:58:23Z
Quantum Rings with Rashba spin orbit coupling: a path integral approach,"We employ a path integral real time approach to compute the DC conductance
and spin polarization for electrons transported across a ballistic Quantum Ring
with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We use a piecewise semiclassical
approximation for the particle orbital motion and solve the spin dynamics
exactly, by accounting for both Zeeman coupling and spin-orbit interaction at
the same time. Within our approach, we are able to study how the interplay
between Berry phase, Ahronov Casher phase, Zeeman interaction and weak
localization corrections influences the quantum interference in the conductance
within a wide range of externally applied fields. Our results are helpful in
inerpreting recent measurements on interferometric rings.",2007-03-08T16:33:27Z
Charge modulation driven Fermi surface of Pb-Bi2201,"It is well known that the (1x5) superstructure of Bi cuprate superconductors
will be suppressed due to optimum doping with Pb. Nevertheless, a Fermi surface
map of (Pb,La)-Bi2201 (Pb = 0.4 and La = 0.4) determined by angular resolved
photoemission (ARPES) revealed additional Fermi surface features. Low energy
electron diffraction and X-ray diffraction of these samples showed no sign of
any superstructure. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), on the other hand,
revealed two distinct modulations of the charge density, one of (1x32) and a
second of (6x6) periodicity. The wave vectors of both modulations have been
extracted and used to simulate the corresponding Fermi surface, which is
compared with the experimental one. The origin of these modulations is
discussed in terms of dopant ordering.",2007-02-23T14:22:35Z
"Noise spectrum of a tunnel junction coupled to a nanomechanical
  oscillator","A nanomechanical resonator coupled to a tunnel junction is studied. The
oscillator modulates the transmission of the junction, changing the current and
the noise spectrum. The influence of the oscillator on the noise spectrum of
the junction is investigated, and the noise spectrum is obtained for arbitrary
frequencies, temperatures and bias voltages. We find that the noise spectrum
consists of a noise floor and a peaked structure with peaks at zero frequency,
the oscillator frequency and twice the oscillator frequency. The influence of
the oscillator vanishes if the bias voltage of the junction is lower than the
oscillator frequency. We demonstrate that the peak at the oscillator frequency
can be used to determine the oscillator occupation number, showing that the
current noise in the junction functions as a thermometer for the oscillator.",2007-01-11T14:22:10Z
The time ending the shallow decay of the X-ray light curves of long GRBs,"We show that the mean values and distributions of the time ending the shallow
decay of the light curve of the X-ray afterglow of long gamma ray bursts
(GRBs), the equivalent isotropic energy in the X-ray afterglow up to that time
and the equivalent isotropic GRB energy, as well as the correlations between
them, are precisely those predicted by the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs.
Correlations between prompt and afterglow observables are important in that
they test the overall consistency of a GRB model. In the CB model, the prompt
and afterglow spectra, the endtime, the complex canonical shape of the X-ray
afterglows and the correlations between GRB observables are not surprises, but
predictions.",2007-03-27T20:11:46Z
The ANTARES Optical Beacon System,"ANTARES is a neutrino telescope being deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. It
consists of a three dimensional array of photomultiplier tubes that can detect
the Cherenkov light induced by charged particles produced in the interactions
of neutrinos with the surrounding medium. High angular resolution can be
achieved, in particular when a muon is produced, provided that the Cherenkov
photons are detected with sufficient timing precision. Considerations of the
intrinsic time uncertainties stemming from the transit time spread in the
photomultiplier tubes and the mechanism of transmission of light in sea water
lead to the conclusion that a relative time accuracy of the order of 0.5 ns is
desirable. Accordingly, different time calibration systems have been developed
for the ANTARES telescope. In this article, a system based on Optical Beacons,
a set of external and well-controlled pulsed light sources located throughout
the detector, is described. This calibration system takes into account the
optical properties of sea water, which is used as the detection volume of the
ANTARES telescope. The design, tests, construction and first results of the two
types of beacons, LED and laser-based, are presented.",2007-03-14T12:26:33Z
"Electrical transport and percolation in magnetoresistive manganite /
  insulating oxide composites: case of La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 / Mn3O4","We report the results of electrical resistivity measurements carried out on
well-sintered La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 / Mn3O4 composite samples with almost constant
composition of the magnetoresistive manganite phase (La0.7Ca0.3MnO3). A
percolation threshold (fc) occurs when the La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 volume fraction is ~
0.19. The dependence of the electrical resistivity as a function of
La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 volume fraction (fLCMO) can be described by percolation-like
phenomenological equations. Fitting the conducting regime (fLCMO > fc) by the
percolation power law returns a critical exponent t value of 2.0 +/- 0.2 at
room temperature and 2.6 +/-0.2 at 5 K. The increase of t is ascribed to the
influence of the grain boundaries on the electrical conduction process at low
temperature.",2007-03-14T11:09:46Z
Superconductivity in doped cubic silicon: an ab initio study,"We study within a first-principle approach the band structure, vibrational
modes and electron-phonon coupling in boron, aluminum and phosphorus doped
silicon in the diamond phase. Our results provide evidences that the recently
discovered superconducting transition in boron doped cubic silicon can be
explained within a standard phonon-mediated mechanism. The importance of
lattice compression and dopant related stretching modes are emphasized. We find
that T$_C$ can be increased by one order of magnitude by adopting aluminum
doping instead of boron.",2007-01-10T09:27:24Z
"The structure of the free energy surface of coarse-grained off-lattice
  protein models","We have performed multicanonical simulations of hydrophobic-hydrophilic
heteropolymers with a simple effective, coarse-grained off-lattice model to
study the structure and the topology of the energy surface. The multicanonical
method samples the whole rugged energy landscape, in particular the low-energy
part, and enables one to better understand the critical behaviors and visualize
the folding pathways of the considered protein model.",2007-03-23T09:25:31Z
"Non-Destructive Mechanical Characterization of Sic Fibers by Raman
  Spectroscopy","The paper provides a comprehensive study on Raman spectroscopy versatility as
a fast and non destructive tool for the prediction of the mechanical properties
of SiC fibers derived from a polymeric precursor (NLM, Hi, Hi-S, SA and
Sylramic grades) or produced by CVD (SCS-6 fiber), including in situ analysis
in CMCs or MMCs. We show how the results of very simple spectra fitting are
correlated with Young's modulus, tensile strength and micro-hardness. The
reason why such a correlation exists, the common dependency of Raman signal and
mechanical behavior to the micro/nanostructure of ceramics, is discussed.",2007-01-15T16:55:16Z
Critical exponents of small one-dimensional ising magnetic,"Within the framework of a generalized Ising model, a one-dimensional magnetic

"Creation of Entanglement between Two Electron Spins Induced by Many Spin
  Ensemble Excitations","We theoretically explore the possibility of creating spin entanglement by
simultaneously coupling two electronic spins to a nuclear ensemble. By
microscopically modeling the spin ensemble with a single mode boson field, we
use the time-dependent Fr\""{o}hlich transformation (TDFT) method developed most
recently [Yong Li, C. Bruder, and C. P. Sun, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{75}, 032302
(2007)] to calculate the effective coupling between the two spins. Our
investigation shows that the total system realizes a solid state based
architecture for cavity QED. Exchanging such kind effective boson in a virtual
process can result in an effective interaction between two spins. It is
discovered that a maximum entangled state can be obtained when the velocity of
the electrons matches the initial distance between them in a suitable way.
Moreover, we also study how the number of collective excitations influences the
entanglement. It is shown that the larger the number of excitation is, the less
the two spins entangle each other.",2007-03-13T14:57:33Z
Generating Single Microwave Photons in a Circuit,"Electromagnetic signals in circuits consist of discrete photons, though
conventional voltage sources can only generate classical fields with a coherent
superposition of many different photon numbers. While these classical signals
can control and measure bits in a quantum computer (qubits), single photons can
carry quantum information, enabling non-local quantum interactions, an
important resource for scalable quantum computing. Here, we demonstrate an
on-chip single photon source in a circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED)
architecture, with a microwave transmission line cavity that collects the
spontaneous emission of a single superconducting qubit with high efficiency.
The photon source is triggered by a qubit rotation, as a photon is generated
only when the qubit is excited. Tomography of both qubit and fluorescence
photon shows that arbitrary qubit states can be mapped onto the photon state,
demonstrating an ability to convert a stationary qubit into a flying qubit.
Both the average power and voltage of the photon source are characterized to
verify performance of the system. This single photon source is an important
addition to a rapidly growing toolbox for quantum optics on a chip.",2007-02-27T17:17:32Z
"A generic method for modelling the behavior of anisotropic metallic
  materials : application to recrystallized zirconium alloys","A simplified polycrystalline model (the so-called RL model) is proposed to
simulate the anisotropic viscoplastic behavior of metallic materials. A generic
method is presented that makes it possible to build a simplified anisotropic
material texture, based on the principal features of the pole figures. The
method is applied to a recrystallized zirconium alloy, used as clad material in
the fuel rods of nuclear power plants. An important database consisting in
mechanical tests performed on Zircaloy tubes is collected. Only a small number
of tests (pure tension, pure shear) are used to identify the material
parameters, and the texture parameters. It is shown that six crystallographic
orientations (6 ""grains"") are sufficient to describe the large anisotropy of
such hcp alloy. The identified crystallographic orientations match the
experimental pole figures of the material, not used in the identification
procedure. Special attention is paid to the predictive ability of the model,
i.e., its ability to simulate correctly experimental tests not belonging to the
identification database. These predictive results are good, thanks to an
identification procedure that enables to consider the contribution of each slip
system in each crystallographic orientation.",2007-03-02T12:46:19Z
"Systematic errors and combination of individual CRF solutions in the
  framework of the international pilot project for the next ICRF","A new international Pilot Project for the re-determination of the ICRF was
initiated by the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS) in
January 2005. The purpose of this project is to compare the individual CRF
solutions and to analyze their systematic and random errors with focus on the
selection of the optimal strategy for the next ICRF realization. Eight radio
source catalogues provided by the IVS Analysis Centers GA, SHAO, DGFI,
GIUB-BKG, JPL, MAO NANU, GSFC, USNO were analyzed. In present study, four
analytical models were used to investigate the systematic differences between
solutions: solid rotation, rotation and deformation (IERS method), and
expansion in orthogonal functions: Legendre-Fourier polynomials and spherical
functions. It was found that expansions by orthogonal function describe the
differences between individual catalogues better than the two former models.
Finally, the combined CRF was generated. Using the radio source positions from
this combined catalogue for estimation of EOP has shown improvement of the
uncertainty of the celestial pole offset time series.",2007-03-08T21:26:40Z
Creation of multiple nanodots by single ions,"In the challenging search for tools that are able to modify surfaces on the
nanometer scale, heavy ions with energies of several 10 MeV are becoming more
and more attractive. In contrast to slow ions where nuclear stopping is
important and the energy is dissipated into a large volume in the crystal, in
the high energy regime the stopping is due to electronic excitations only.
Because of the extremely local (< 1 nm) energy deposition with densities of up
to 10E19 W/cm^2, nanoscaled hillocks can be created under normal incidence.
Usually, each nanodot is due to the impact of a single ion and the dots are
randomly distributed. We demonstrate that multiple periodically spaced dots
separated by a few 10 nanometers can be created by a single ion if the sample
is irradiated under grazing angles of incidence. By varying this angle the
number of dots can be controlled.",2007-01-29T10:59:45Z
"Strongly enhanced critical current density in Fe-sheathed MgB2 tapes by
  stearic acid and stearate doping","Fe-sheathed MgB2 tapes with cheap stearic acid, Mg stearate and Zn stearate
doping were prepared through the in situ powder-in-tube method. It is found
that Jc, Hirr, and Hc2 were significantly enhanced by doping. Compared to the
pure tapes, Jc for all the doped samples was improved by more than an order of
magnitude in a high-field regime. At 4.2 K, the transport Jc reached 2.02x10^4
A/cm^2 at 10 T for the Zn stearate doped tapes and 3.72x10^3 A/cm^2 at 14 T for
the stearic acid doped samples, respectively, equivalent to that of tapes
achieved by nanoscale SiC or carbon doping. The improvement of Jc-H properties
in doped samples can be attributed to the increase of Hc2 resulting from the
incorporation of C atoms into the MgB2 crystal lattice as well as a high
density of flux-pinning centers.",2007-01-16T12:56:53Z
Critical Point of an Interacting Two-Dimensional Atomic Bose Gas,"We have measured the critical atom number in an array of harmonically trapped
two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases of rubidium atoms at different temperatures. We
found this number to be about five times higher than predicted by the
semi-classical theory of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the ideal gas.
This demonstrates that the conventional BEC picture is inapplicable in an
interacting 2D atomic gas, in sharp contrast to the three-dimensional case. A
simple heuristic model based on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory of
2D superfluidity and the local density approximation accounts well for our
experimental results.",2007-03-08T08:53:53Z
The Global Star Formation Law: from Dense Cores to Extreme Starbursts,"Active star formation (SF) is tightly related to the dense molecular gas in
the giant molecular clouds' dense cores. Our HCN (measure of the dense
molecular gas) survey in 65 galaxies (including 10 ultraluminous galaxies)
reveals a tight linear correlation between HCN and IR (SF rate) luminosities,
whereas the correlation between IR and CO (measure of the total molecular gas)
luminosities is nonlinear. This suggests that the global SF rate depends more
intimately upon the amount of dense molecular gas than the total molecular gas
content. This linear relationship extends to both the dense cores in the Galaxy
and the hyperluminous extreme starbursts at high-redshift. Therefore, the
global SF law in dense gas appears to be linear all the way from dense cores to
extreme starbursts, spanning over nine orders of magnitude in IR luminosity.",2007-03-21T07:39:49Z
Evolution of entanglement after a local quench,"We study free electrons on an infinite half-filled chain, starting in the
ground state with a bond defect. We find a logarithmic increase of the
entanglement entropy after the defect is removed, followed by a slow relaxation
towards the value of the homogeneous chain. The coefficients depend
continuously on the defect strength.",2007-03-14T16:20:40Z
"Electronic Charge Order in the Pseudogap State of $Bi_2 Sr_2 Ca Cu_2

$4a$$\times$$4a$ electronic charge order (CO) in the pseudogap (PG) state above
{\it T}$_{\rm c}$ on Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$. It is
demonstrated that the static CO develops markedly in the inhomogeneous PG
state, while it is very weak in the homogeneous PG state. We suggest that this
static CO, which is considered to be stabilized by the pinning of the
dynamically fluctuating CO, will remain below {\it T}$_{\rm c}$, together with
the inhomogeneous gap structure, and coexist with the superconductivity.",2007-03-05T06:47:27Z
"Efficient estimation of default correlation for multivariate
  jump-diffusion processes","Evaluation of default correlation is an important task in credit risk
analysis. In many practical situations, it concerns the joint defaults of
several correlated firms, the task that is reducible to a first passage time
(FPT) problem. This task represents a great challenge for jump-diffusion
processes (JDP), where except for very basic cases, there are no analytical
solutions for such problems. In this contribution, we generalize our previous
fast Monte-Carlo method (non-correlated jump-diffusion cases) for multivariate
(and correlated) jump-diffusion processes. This generalization allows us, among
other things, to evaluate the default events of several correlated assets based
on a set of empirical data. The developed technique is an efficient tool for a
number of other applications, including credit risk and option pricing.",2007-02-28T11:22:18Z
"Topological defects in the crystalline state of one-component plasmas of
  non-uniform density","We study the ground state properties of classical Coulomb charges interacting
with a 1/r potential moving on a plane but confined either by a circular hard
wall boundary or by a harmonic potential. The charge density in the continuum
limit is determined analytically and is non-uniform. Because of the non-uniform
density there are both disclinations and dislocations present and their
distribution across the system is calculated and shown to be in agreement with
numerical studies of the ground state (or at least low-energy states) of N
charges, where values of N up to 5000 have been studied. A consequence of these
defects is that although the charges locally form into a triangular lattice
structure, the lattice lines acquire a marked curvature. A study is made of
conformal crystals to illuminate the origin of this curvature. The scaling of
various terms which contribute to the overall energy of the system of charges
viz, the continuum electrostatic energy, correlation energy, surface energy
(and so on) as a function of the number of particles N is determined. ""Magic
number"" clusters are those at special values of N whose energies take them
below the energy estimated from the scaling forms and are identified with
charge arrangements of high symmetry.",2007-02-27T18:57:31Z
"Construction of Minimal Tail-Biting Trellises for Codes over Finite
  Abelian Groups","A definition of atomic codeword for a group code is presented. Some
properties of atomic codewords of group codes are investigated. Using these
properties, it is shown that every minimal tail-biting trellis for a group code
over a finite abelian group can be constructed from its characteristic
generators, which extends the work of Koetter and Vardy who treated the case of
a linear code over a field. We also present an efficient algorithm for
constructing the minimal tail-biting trellis of a group code over a finite
abelian group, given a generator matrix.",2007-02-05T16:41:12Z
Phonon dispersion in graphene,"Taking into account the constraints imposed by the lattice symmetry, the
phonon dispersion is calculated for graphene with interactions between the
first and second nearest neighbors in the framework of the Born-von Karman
model. Analytical expressions are obtained for the out-of-plane (bending) modes
determined only by two force constants as well as for the in-plane modes with
four force constants. Values of the force constants are found in fitting to
elastic constants and Raman frequencies observed in graphite.",2007-02-17T20:08:37Z
"On the macroion virial contribution to the osmotic pressure in
  charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions","Our interest goes to the different virial contributions to the equation of
state of charged colloidal suspensions. Neglect of surface effects in the
computation of the colloidal virial term leads to spurious and paradoxical
results. This pitfall is one of the several facets of the danger of a naive
implementation of the so called One Component Model, where the micro-ionic
degrees of freedom are integrated out to only keep in the description the
mesoscopic (colloidal) degrees of freedom. On the other hand, due incorporation
of wall induced forces dissolves the paradox brought forth in the naive
approach, provides a consistent description, and confirms that for salt-free
systems, the colloidal contribution to the pressure is dominated by the
micro-ionic one. Much emphasis is put on the no salt case but the situation
with added electrolyte is also discussed.",2007-01-31T11:11:38Z
"Gravity induced neutrino-antineutrino oscillation: CPT and lepton number
  non-conservation under gravity","We introduce a new effect in the neutrino oscillation phase which shows the
neutrino-antineutrino oscillation is possible under gravity even if the rest
masses of the corresponding eigenstates are same. This is due to CPT violation
and possible to demonstrate if the neutrino mass eigenstates are expressed as a
combination of neutrino and antineutrino eigenstates, as of the neutral kaon
system, with the plausible breaking of lepton number conservation. For Majorana
neutrinos, this oscillation is expected to affect significantly the inner edge
of neutrino dominated accretion disks around a compact object by influencing
the neutrino sphere which controls the accretion dynamics, and then the related
type-II supernova evolution and the r-process nucleosynthesis. On the other
hand, in early universe, in presence of various lepton number violating
processes, this oscillation, we argue, might lead to neutrino asymmetry which
resulted baryogenesis from the B-L symmetry by electro-weak sphaleron
processes.",2007-02-10T07:20:01Z
"High Resolution Photoemission Study on Low-T_K Ce Systems: Kondo
  Resonance, Crystal Field Structures, and their Temperature Dependence","We present a high-resolution photoemission study on the strongly correlated
Ce-compounds CeCu_6, CeCu_2Si_2, CeRu_2Si_2, CeNi_2Ge_2, and CeSi_2. Using a
normalization procedure based on a division by the Fermi-Dirac distribution we
get access to the spectral density of states up to an energy of 5 k_BT above
the Fermi energy E_F. Thus we can resolve the Kondo resonance and the crystal
field (CF) fine-structure for different temperatures above and around the Kondo
temperature T_K. The CF peaks are identified with multiple Kondo resonances
within the multiorbital Anderson impurity model. Our theoretical 4f spectra,
calculated from an extended non-crossing approximation (NCA), describe
consistently the observed photoemission features and their temperature
dependence. By fitting the NCA spectra to the experimental data and
extrapolating the former to low temperatures, T_K can be extracted
quantitatively. The resulting values for T_K and the crystal field energies are
in excellent agreement with the results from bulk sensitive measurements, e.g.
inelastic neutron scattering.",2007-02-15T13:44:17Z
Origin of dips in tunneling dI/dV characteristics of cuprates,"Extensive efforts have been made to understand the electronic properties of
high-Tc superconductors. One feature which has been discussed in the literature
during the past few years is the dips in tunneling conductances obtained in
cuprates. In this contribution, we focus our attention on the origin of these
dips. On the basis of experimental data obtained in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 and
YBa2Cu3O7, we show that the dips appear naturally in tunneling spectra due to a
superposition of the peaks and humps and, therefore, have no physical meaning.",2007-02-28T17:33:29Z
Virial coefficients and demixing of athermal nonadditive mixtures,"We compute the fourth virial coefficient of a binary nonadditive hard-sphere
mixture over a wide range of deviations from diameter additivity and size
ratios. Hinging on this knowledge, we build up a $y$ expansion [B. Barboy and
W. N. Gelbart, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 71}, 3053 (1979)] in order to trace the
fluid-fluid coexistence lines which we then compare with the available
Gibbs-ensemble Monte Carlo data and with the estimates obtained through two
refined integral-equation theories of the fluid state. We find that in a regime
of moderately negative nonadditivity and largely asymmetric diameters, relevant
to the modelling of sterically and electrostatically stabilized colloidal
mixtures, the fluid-fluid critical point is unstable with respect to
crystallization.",2007-03-01T17:42:33Z
"Collapse Transition of Two-Dimensional Flexible and Semiflexible
  Polymers","The nature of the globule-coil transition of surface-confined polymers has
been an issue of debate. Here this 2D collapse transition is studied through a
partially directed lattice model. In the general case of polymers with positive
bending stiffness ($\Delta>0$), the collapse transition is {\em first-order};
it becomes {\em second-order} only in the limiting case of zero bending
stiffness ($\Delta\equiv 0$). These analytical results are confirmed by Monte
Carlo simulations. We also suggest some possible future experiments.",2007-01-18T08:42:11Z
Anharmonic magnetic deformation of self-assembled molecular nanocapsules,"High magnetic fields were used to deform spherical nanocapsules,
self-assembled from bola-amphiphilic sexithiophene molecules. At low fields the
deformation -- measured through linear birefringence -- scales quadratically
with the capsule radius and with the magnetic field strength. These data
confirm a long standing theoretical prediction (W. Helfrich, Phys. Lett. {\bf
43A}, 409 (1973)), and permits the determination of the bending rigidity of the
capsules as (2.6$\pm$0.8)$\times 10^{-21}$ J. At high fields, an enhanced
rigidity is found which cannot be explained within the Helfrich model. We
propose a complete form of the free energy functional that accounts for this
behaviour, and allows discussion of the formation and stability of nanocapsules
in solution.",2007-03-12T15:28:12Z
Embedding Graphs into the Extended Grid,"Let $G=(V,E)$ be an arbitrary undirected source graph to be embedded in a
target graph $EM$, the extended grid with vertices on integer grid points and
edges to nearest and next-nearest neighbours. We present an algorithm showing
how to embed $G$ into $EM$ in both time and space $O(|V|^2)$ using the new
notions of islands and bridges. An island is a connected subgraph in the target
graph which is mapped from exactly one vertex in the source graph while a
bridge is an edge between two islands which is mapped from exactly one edge in
the source graph. This work is motivated by real industrial applications in the
field of quantum computing and a need to efficiently embed source graphs in the
extended grid.",2007-02-28T22:37:52Z
"Probing the Large-Scale Homogeneity of the Universe with Galaxy Redshift
  Surveys","Modern cosmological observations clearly reveal that the universe contains a
hierarchy of clustering. However, recent surveys show a transition to
homogeneity on large scales. The exact scale at which this transition occurs is
still a topic of much debate. There has been much work done in trying to
characterise the galaxy distribution using multifractals. However, for a number
of years the size, depth and accuracy of galaxy surveys was regarded as
insufficient to give a definitive answer. One of the main problems which arises
in a multifractal analysis is how to deal with observational selection effects:
ie `masks' in the survey region and a geometric boundary to the survey itself.
  In this thesis I will introduce a volume boundary correction which is rather
similar to the approach developed by Pan and Coles in 2001, but which improves
on their angular boundary correction in two important respects: firstly, our
volume correction `throws away' fewer galaxies close the boundary of a given
data set and secondly it is computationally more efficient.
  After application of our volume correction, I will then show how the
underlying generalised dimensions of a given point set can be computed. I will
apply this procedure to calculate the generalised fractal dimensions of both
simulated fractal point sets and mock galaxy surveys which mimic the properties
of the recent IRAS PSCz catalogue.",2007-03-19T16:01:54Z
"The Survey for Ionization in Neutral-Gas Galaxies: III. Diffuse, Warm
  Ionized Medium and Escape of Ionizing Radiation","We use the first data release from the SINGG H-alpha survey of HI-selected
galaxies to study the quantitative behavior of the diffuse, warm ionized medium
(WIM) across the range of properties represented by these 109 galaxies. The
mean fraction f_WIM of diffuse ionized gas in this sample is 0.59+/- 0.19,
slightly higher than found in previous samples. Since lower surface-brightness
galaxies tend to have higher f_WIM, we believe that most of this difference is
due to selection effects favoring large, optically-bright, nearby galaxies with
high star-formation rates. As found in previous studies, there is no
appreciable correlation with Hubble type or total star-formation rate. However,
we find that starburst galaxies, defined here by an H-alpha surface brightness
> 2.5x 10^39 erg s^-1 kpc^-2 within the H-alpha half-light radius, do show much
lower fractions of diffuse H-alpha emission. The cause apparently is not
dominated by a lower fraction of field OB stars. However, it is qualitatively
consistent with an expected escape of ionizing radiation above a threshold
star-formation rate, predicted from our model in which the ISM is shredded by
pressure-driven supernova feedback. The HI gas fractions in the starburst
galaxies are also lower, suggesting that the starbursts are consuming and
ionizing all the gas, and thus promoting regions of density-bounded ionization.
If true, these effects imply that some amount of Lyman continuum radiation is
escaping from most starburst galaxies, and that WIM properties and outflows
from mechanical feedback are likely to be pressure-driven. However, in view of
previous studies showing that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation is
generally low, it is likely that other factors also drive the low fractions of
diffuse ionized gas in starbursts.",2007-03-01T22:17:27Z
"Photometric study of distant open clusters in the second quadrant: NGC
  7245, King 9, King 13 and IC 166","We present a UBV CCD photometric study of four open clusters, NGC 7245, King
9, IC 166 and King 13, located between $l = 90^o - 135^o$. All are embedded in
a rich galactic field. NGC 7245 and King 9 are close together in the sky and
have similar reddenings. The distances and ages are: NGC 7245, 3.8$\pm$0.35 kpc
and 400 Myr; King 9 (the most distant cluster in this quadrant) 7.9$\pm$1.1 kpc
and 3.0 Gyr. King 13 is 3.1$\pm$0.3 kpc distant and 300 Myr old. King 9 and IC
166 (4.8$\pm$0.5 kpc distant & 1 Gyr old) may be metal poor clusters (Z=0.008),
as estimated from isochrone fitting. The average value of the distance of young
clusters from the galactic plane in the above longitude range and beyond 2 kpc
($-47\pm$16 pc, for 64 clusters), indicates that the young disk bends towards
the southern latitudes.",2007-03-05T12:26:34Z
"Electron Density Dependence of in-plane Spin Relaxation Anisotropy in
  GaAs/AlGaAs Two-Dimensional Electron Gas","We investigated the spin dynamics of two-dimensional electrons in (001)
GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure using the time resolved Kerr rotation technique
under a transverse magnetic field. The in-plane spin lifetime is found to be
anisotropic below 150k due to the interference of Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling and D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation. The ratio of in-plane
spin lifetimes is measured directly as a function of temperature and pump
power, showing that the electron density in 2DEG channel strongly affects the
Rashba spin-orbit coupling.",2007-01-10T09:42:32Z
"Quasar 3C298: a test-case for meteoritic nanodiamond 3.5 microns
  emission","We calculate the dust emission expected at 3.43 and 3.53 microns if
meteoritic (i.e. hydrogenated) nanodiamonds are responsible for most of the
far-UV break observed in quasars.
  We integrate the UV flux that hydrogenated nanodiamonds must absorb to
reproduce the far-UV break. Based on laboratory spectra of H-terminated diamond
surfaces, we analyse the radiative energy budget and derive theoretically the
IR emission profiles expected for possible C-H surface stretch modes of the
diamonds.
  Using as test case a spectrum of 3C298 provided by the Spitzer Observatory,
we do not find evidence of these emission bands.
  While diamonds without surface adsorbates remain a viable candidate for
explaining the far-UV break observed in quasars, hydrogenated nanodiamonds
appear to be ruled out, as they would giverise to IR emission bands, which have
not been observed so far.",2007-03-05T16:24:47Z
Effects of Baryons and Dissipation on the Matter Power Spectrum,"We study the importance of baryonic physics on predictions of the matter
power spectrum as it is relevant for forthcoming weak lensing surveys. We
quantify the impact of baryonic physics using a set of three cosmological
numerical simulations. Each simulation has the same initial density field, but
models a different set of physical processes. The first simulation evolves the
density field using gravity alone, the second includes non-radiative
gasdynamics, and the third includes radiative heating and cooling of baryons,
star formation, and supernova feedback. We find that baryonic processes alter
predictions for the matter power spectrum significantly relative to models that
include only gravitational interactions. Our results imply that future weak
lensing experiments such as LSST and SNAP will be very sensitive to the
poorly-understood physics governing the nonlinear evolution of the baryonic
component of the universe. The net effect is significantly larger in the case
of the model with cooling and star formation, in which case our results imply
that contemporary surveys such as the CFHT Wide survey may also be sensitive to
baryonic processes. In particular, this effect could be important for forecasts
of the constraining power of future surveys if information from scales larger
than l ~ 1000 is included in the analysis. We find that deviations are caused
primarily by the rearrangement of matter within individual dark matter halos
relative to the gravity-only case, rather than a large-scale rearrangement of
matter. Consequently, we propose a simple model, based on the phenomenological
halo model of dark matter clustering, for baryonic effects that can be used to
aid in the interpretation of forthcoming weak lensing data.",2007-03-29T19:18:34Z
Cosmological Perturbations in Elastic Dark Energy Models,"We discuss the general framework for a perfect continuum medium in cosmology
and show that an interesting generalization of the fluids normally used is for
the medium to have rigidity and, hence, be analogous to an elastic solid. Such
models can provide perfect, adiabatic fluids which are stable even when the
pressure is negative, if the rigidity is sufficiently large, making them
natural candidates to describe the dark energy. In fact, if the medium is
adiabatic and isotropic, they provide the most general description of
linearized perturbations. We derive the equations of motion and wave
propagation speeds in the isotropic case. We point out that anisotropic models
can also be incorporated within the same formalism and that they are classified
by the standard Bravais Lattices. We identify the adiabatic and isocurvature
modes allowed in both the scalar and vector sectors and discuss the predictions
they make for CMB and matter power spectra. We comment on the relationship
between these models and other fluid-based approaches to dark energy, and
discuss a possible microphysical manifestation of this class of models as a
continuum description of defect-dominated scenarios.",2007-03-28T23:46:21Z
"Large scale structure in the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey: Filling the Voids
  with HI galaxies?","We estimate the two-point correlation function in redshift space of the
recently compiled HIPASS neutral hydrogen (HI) sources catalogue, which if
modeled as a power law, $\xi(r)=(r_{0}/r)^{\gamma}$, the best-fitting
parameters for the HI selected galaxies are found to be $r_{0}=3.3 \pm 0.3
h^{-1}$ Mpc with $\gamma=1.38 \pm 0.24$. Fixing the slope to its universal
value $\gamma=1.8$, we obtain $r_{0}= 3.2\pm 0.2 h^{-1}$ Mpc. Comparing the
measured two point correlation function with the predictions of the concordance
cosmological model, we find that at the present epoch the HI selected galaxies
are anti-biased with respect to the underlying matter fluctuation field with
their bias value being $b_{0}\simeq 0.68$. Furthermore, dividing the HI
galaxies into two richness subsamples we find that the low mass HI galaxies
have a very low present bias factor ($b_{0}\simeq 0.48$), while the high mass
HI galaxies trace the underlying matter distribution as the optical galaxies
($b_{0}\simeq 1$). Using our derived present-day HI galaxy bias we estimate
their redshift space distortion parameter, and correct accordingly the
correlation function for peculiar motions. The resulting real-space correlation
length is $r^{\rm re}_{0}=1.8 \pm 0.2 h^{-1}$Mpc and $r^{\rm re}_{0}=3.9 \pm
0.6 h^{-1}$Mpc for the low and high mass HI galaxies, respectively. The
low-mass HI galaxies appear to have the lowest correlation length among all
extragalactic populations studied to-date. Also, we have correlated the
IRAS-PSCz reconstructed density field, smoothed over scales of 5$h^{-1}$ Mpc,
with the positions of the HI galaxies, to find that indeed the HI galaxies are
typically found in negative overdensity regions ($\delta\rho/\rho_{\rm PSCz}
\mincir 0$).",2007-03-28T07:48:41Z
"Electron and phonon dispersions of the two dimensional Holstein model:
  Effects of vertex and non-local corrections","I apply the newly developed dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) to the
calculation of the electron and phonon dispersions in the two dimensional
Holstein model. In contrast to previous work, the DCA enables the effects of
spatial fluctuations (non-local corrections) to be examined. Approximations
neglecting and incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are investigated.
I calculate the phonon density of states, the renormalised phonon dispersion,
the electron dispersion and electron spectral functions. I demonstrate how
vertex corrections stabilise the solution, stopping a catastrophic softening of
the $(\pi,\pi)$ phonon mode. A kink in the electron dispersion is found in the
normal state along the $(\zeta,\zeta)$ symmetry direction in both the vertex-
and non-vertex-corrected theories for low phonon frequencies, corresponding
directly to the renormalised phonon frequency at the $(\pi,0)$ point. This kink
is accompanied by a sudden drop in the quasi-particle lifetime. Vertex and
non-local corrections enhance the effects at large bare phonon frequencies.",2007-02-24T17:56:38Z
"Magneto-resistivity model and ionization energy approximation for
  ferromagnets","The evolution of resistivity versus temperature ($\rho(T)$) curve for
different doping elements, and in the presence of various defects and
clustering are explained for both diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) and
manganites. Here, we provide unambiguous evidence that the concept of
ionization energy ($E_I$), which is explicitly associated with the atomic
energy levels, can be related quantitatively to transport measurements. The
proposed ionization energy model is used to understand how the valence states
of ions affect the evolution of $\rho(T)$ curves for different doping elements.
We also explain how the $\rho(T)$ curves evolve in the presence of, and in the
absence of defects and clustering. The model also complements the results
obtained from first-principles calculations.",2007-01-22T11:35:48Z
"Orbital correlations in monolayer manganites - From spin t-J model to
  orbital t-J model","On the example of monolayer manganites we show that the theoretical ideas
developed long ago along the derivation of the spin t-J model from the Hubbard
model are nowadays very helpful in strongly correlated oxides with partly
filled degenerate orbitals. We analyze a realistic orbital t-J model for e_g
electrons in La_{1-x}Sr_{1+x}MnO_4 monolayer manganites, and discuss the
evolution of spin and orbital correlations under increasing doping by
performing exact diagonalization of finite clusters, with electronic kinetic
energy determined self-consistently at finite temperature by classical Monte
Carlo for t_2g spins. Several experimental results are reproduced.",2007-03-05T16:43:35Z
Dynamical Origin of Extrasolar Planet Eccentricity Distribution,"We explore the possibility that the observed eccentricity distribution of
extrasolar planets arose through planet-planet interactions, after the initial
stage of planet formation was complete. Our results are based on ~3250
numerical integrations of ensembles of randomly constructed planetary systems,
each lasting 100 Myr. We find that for a remarkably wide range of initial
conditions the eccentricity distributions of dynamically active planetary
systems relax towards a common final equilibrium distribution, well described
by the fitting formula dn ~ e exp[-1/2 (e/0.3)^2] de. This distribution agrees
well with the observed eccentricity distribution for e > 0.2, but predicts too
few planets at lower eccentricities, even when we exclude planets subject to
tidal circularization. These findings suggest that a period of large-scale
dynamical instability has occurred in a significant fraction of newly formed
planetary systems, lasting 1--2 orders of magnitude longer than the ~1 Myr
interval in which gas-giant planets are assembled. This mechanism predicts no
(or weak) correlations between semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, and
mass in dynamically relaxed planetary systems. An additional observational
consequence of dynamical relaxation is a significant population of planets
(>10%) that are highly inclined (>25deg) with respect to the initial symmetry
plane of the protoplanetary disk; this population may be detectable in
transiting planets through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.",2007-03-07T21:00:05Z
"High shock release in ultrafast laser irradiated metals: Scenario for
  material ejection","We present one-dimensional numerical simulations describing the behavior of
solid matter exposed to subpicosecond near infrared pulsed laser radiation. We
point out to the role of strong isochoric heating as a mechanism for producing
highly non-equilibrium thermodynamic states. In the case of metals, the
conditions of material ejection from the surface are discussed in a
hydrodynamic context, allowing correlation of the thermodynamic features with
ablation mechanisms. A convenient synthetic representation of the thermodynamic
processes is presented, emphasizing different competitive pathways of material
ejection. Based on the study of the relaxation and cooling processes which
constrain the system to follow original thermodynamic paths, we establish that
the metal surface can exhibit several kinds of phase evolution which can result
in phase explosion or fragmentation. An estimation of the amount of material
exceeding the specific energy required for melting is reported for copper and
aluminum and a theoretical value of the limit-size of the recast material after
ultrashort laser irradiation is determined. Ablation by mechanical
fragmentation is also analysed and compared to experimental data for aluminum
subjected to high tensile pressures and ultrafast loading rates. Spallation is
expected to occur at the rear surface of the aluminum foils and a comparison
with simulation results can determine a spall strength value related to high
strain rates.",2007-03-19T10:03:47Z
Ridge Network in Crumpled Paper,"The network formed by ridges in a straightened sheet of crumpled paper is
studied using a laser profilometer. Square sheets of paper were crumpled into
balls, unfolded and their height profile measured. From these profiles the
imposed ridges were extracted as networks. Nodes were defined as intersections
between ridges, and links as the various ridges connecting the nodes. Many
network and spatial properties have been investigated. The tail of the ridge
length distribution was found to follow a power-law whereas the shorter ridges
followed a log-normal distribution. The degree distribution was found to have
an exponentially decaying tail, and the degree correlation was found to be
disassortative. The facets created by the ridges and the Voronoi diagram formed
by the nodes have also been investigated.",2007-03-01T10:42:47Z
"Vacuum fluctuations and the spin current in mesoscopic structures with
  collinear magnetic order","We show that in magnetic nanostructures with a homogeneous magnetic order,
the equilibrium spin current can be nonzero. For example, this is the case of a
wide magnetic ring with the magnetization along the ring axis. The physical
reason of this effect is a variation of the orientation of anisotropy axis
inducing a spin torque acting on the magnetic ions. The mechanism of the spin
current generation is related to the quantum vacuum fluctuations in the
magnetic system.",2007-02-07T10:30:39Z
"An Intrinsic Bond-Centered Electronic Glass with Unidirectional Domains
  in Underdoped Cuprates","Removing electrons from the CuO2 plane of cuprates alters the electronic
correlations sufficiently to produce high-temperature superconductivity.
Associated with these changes are spectral weight transfers from the high
energy states of the insulator to low energies. In theory, these should be
detectable as an imbalance between the tunneling rate for electron injection
and extraction - a tunneling asymmetry. We introduce atomic-resolution
tunneling-asymmetry imaging, finding virtually identical phenomena in two
lightly hole-doped cuprates: Ca1.88Na0.12CuO2Cl2 and Bi2Sr2Dy0.2Ca0.8Cu2O8+d.
Intense spatial variations in tunneling asymmetry occur primarily at the planar
oxygen sites; their spatial arrangement forms a Cu-O-Cu bond centered
electronic pattern without long range order but with 4a0-wide unidirectional
electronic domains dispersed throughout (a0: the Cu-O-Cu distance). The
emerging picture is then of a partial hole-localization within an intrinsic
electronic glass evolving, at higher hole-densities, into complete
delocalization and highest temperature superconductivity.",2007-03-12T22:29:55Z
"Differences between discontinuous and continuous soft-core attractive
  potentials: the appearance of density anomaly","Soft-core attractive potentials can give rise to a phase diagram with three
fluid phases at different densities (gas, low-density liquid and high-density
liquid), separated by first order phase transition lines ending in critical
points. Experiments show a phase diagram with these features for phosphorous
and triphenyl-phosphite. Liquid-liquid phase transition could be relevant for
water, silica, liquid metals, colloids and protein solutions, among others.
Here we compare two potentials with short-range soft-core repulsion and narrow
attraction. One of them is a squared potential that is known to have
liquid-liquid phase transition, ending in a critical point, and no anomaly in
density. The normal, monotonic, behavior of density for isobaric cooling is
surprising if compared with molecular liquids, such as water, where a
hypothetical critical point is proposed as rationale for the anomalous behavior
of density. The second potential is a continuous version of the first. We show
that the phase diagram associated to this new potential has, not only the
liquid-liquid phase transition, but also the density anomaly. Our result,
therefore, shows that the behavior in density is strongly dependent on the
derivative of the potential.",2007-03-26T14:28:47Z
Hydrogen Absorption Properties of Metal-Ethylene Complexes,"Recently, we have predicted [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 226102 (2006)] that a
single ethylene molecule can form stable complexes with light transition metals
(TM) such as Ti and the resulting TMn-ethylene complex can absorb up to ~12 and
14 wt % hydrogen for n=1 and 2, respectively. Here we extend this study to
include a large number of other metals and different isomeric structures. We
obtained interesting results for light metals such as Li. The ethylene molecule
is able to complex with two Li atoms with a binding energy of 0.7 eV/Li which
then binds up to two H2 molecules per Li with a binding energy of 0.24 eV/H2
and absorption capacity of 16 wt %, a record high value reported so far. The
stability of the proposed metal-ethylene complexes was tested by extensive
calculations such as normal-mode analysis, finite temperature first-principles
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and reaction path calculations. The phonon
and MD simulations indicate that the proposed structures are stable up to 500
K. The reaction path calculations indicate about 1 eV activation barrier for
the TM2-ethylene complex to transform into a possible lower energy
configuration where the ethylene molecule is dissociated. Importantly, no
matter which isometric configuration the TM2-ethylene complex possesses, the TM
atoms are able to bind multiple hydrogen molecules with suitable binding energy
for room temperature storage. These results suggest that co-deposition of
ethylene with a suitable precursor of TM or Li into nanopores of light-weight
host materials may be a very promising route to discovering new materials with
high-capacity hydrogen absorption properties.",2007-01-23T20:49:52Z
Phase Transition in a Three-States Reaction-Diffusion System,"A one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model consisting of two species of
particles and vacancies on a ring is introduced. The number of particles in one
species is conserved while in the other species it can fluctuate because of
creation and annihilation of particles. It has been shown that the model
undergoes a continuous phase transition from a phase where the currents of
different species of particles are equal to another phase in which they are
different. The total density of particles and also their currents in each phase
are calculated exactly.",2007-03-08T06:21:20Z
"Evolutionary approach for finding the atomic structure of steps on
  stable crystal surfaces","The problem addressed here can be concisely formulated as follows: given a
stable surface orientation with a known reconstruction and given a direction in
the plane of this surface, find the atomic structure of the steps oriented
along that direction. We report a robust and generally applicable
variable-number genetic algorithm for step structure determination and
exemplify it by determining the structure of monatomic steps on
Si(114)-$2\times 1$. We show how the location of the step edge with respect to
the terrace reconstructions, the step width (number of atoms), and the
positions of the atoms in the step region can all be simultaneously determined.",2007-02-27T01:51:48Z
"BKT-like transition in the Potts model on an inhomogeneous annealed
  network","We solve the ferromagnetic q-state Potts model on an inhomogeneous annealed
network which mimics a random recursive graph. We find that this system has the
inverted Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) phase transition for any $q
\geq 1$, including the values $q \geq 3$, where the Potts model normally shows
a first order phase transition. We obtain the temperature dependences of the
order parameter, specific heat, and susceptibility demonstrating features
typical for the BKT transition. We show that in the entire normal phase, both
the distribution of a linear response to an applied local field and the
distribution of spin-spin correlations have a critical, i.e. power-law, form.",2007-01-08T22:34:07Z
Magnetic and structural study of Cu-doped TiO2 thin films,"Transparent pure and Cu-doped (2.5, 5 and 10 at. %) anatase TiO2 thin films
were grown by pulsed laser deposition technique on LaAlO3 substrates. The
samples were structurally characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and
X-ray diffraction. The magnetic properties were measured using a SQUID. All
films have a FM-like behaviour. In the case of the Cu-doped samples, the
magnetic cycles are almost independent of the Cu concentration. Cu atoms are
forming CuO and/or substituting Ti in TiO2. The thermal treatment in air
promotes the CuO segregation. Since CuO is antiferromagnetic, the magnetic
signals present in the films could be assigned to this Cu substitutionally
replacing cations in TiO2.",2007-02-22T06:04:25Z
Modeling the (upper) solar atmosphere including the magnetic field,"The atmosphere of the Sun is highly structured and dynamic in nature. From
the photosphere and chromosphere into the transition region and the corona
plasma-$\beta$ changes from above to below one, i.e. while in the lower
atmosphere the energy density of the plasma dominates, in the upper atmosphere
the magnetic field plays the governing role -- one might speak of a ``magnetic
transition''. Therefore the dynamics of the overshooting convection in the
photosphere, the granulation, is shuffling the magnetic field around in the
photosphere. This leads not only to a (re-)structuring of the magnetic field in
the upper atmosphere, but induces also the dynamic reaction of the coronal
plasma e.g. due to reconnection events. Therefore the (complex) structure and
the interaction of various magnetic patches is crucial to understand the
structure, dynamics and heating of coronal plasma as well as its acceleration
into the solar wind.
  The present article will emphasize the need for three-dimensional modeling
accounting for the complexity of the solar atmosphere to understand these
processes. Some advances on 3D modeling of the upper solar atmosphere in
magnetically closed as well as open regions will be presented together with
diagnostic tools to compare these models to observations. This highlights the
recent success of these models which in many respects closely match the
observations.",2007-03-21T21:58:38Z
"Quantum dynamics of repulsively bound atom pairs in the Bose-Hubbard
  model","We investigate the quantum dynamics of repulsively bound atom pairs in an
optical lattice described by the periodic Bose-Hubbard model both analytically
and numerically. In the strongly repulsive limit, we analytically study the
dynamical problem by the perturbation method with the hopping terms treated as
a perturbation. For a finite-size system, we numerically solve the dynamic
problem in the whole regime of interaction by the exact diagonalization method.
Our results show that the initially prepared atom pairs are dynamically stable
and the dissociation of atom pairs is greatly suppressed when the strength of
the on-site interaction is much greater than the tunneling amplitude, i.e., the
strongly repulsive interaction induces a self-localization phenomenon of the
atom pairs.",2007-01-21T08:20:17Z
Sharp switching of the magnetization in Fe1/4TaS2,"Anisotropic magneto-transport measurements are reported on Fe1/4TaS2 single
crystals grown by vapor transport. Both the magnetization and resistivity are
extremely anisotropic, with the magnetic moments aligned parallel to the c
crystallographic direction. Fe1/4TaS2 orders ferromagnetically below TC = 160 K
and displays very sharp hysteresis loops in the ordered state for H||c. The
corresponding magnetoresistance is negative, and it qualitatively reproduces
the features observed in the M(H) data, by showing a sharp drop around the
critical field Hs for the moment reversal. The magnetization switching time
shows an unusual increase with increasing temperature. For field applied within
the ab plane, the magnetization remains small and linear in field up to 5 T,
and the magnetoresistance is positive and quadratic in field, with no visible
hysteresis. The squareness of the H||c M(H) loops and the high critical field
for the magnetization switch (Hs = 3.7 T at T = 2 K) allow us to classify
Fe1/4TaS2 as a strong ferromagnet.",2007-01-14T18:36:02Z
"Current correlation functions for chemical sensors based on DNA
  decorated carbon nanotube","The current characteristics of DNA decorated carbon nanotubes for different
gas odors are studied. A simple model of charge transfer between the
Gas-DNA-base complex and single wall carbon nanotube (SWCN) is proposed to
explain the current response for different odors. The autocorrelation and
two-point correlation functions are calculated for the current sensitivity

form finger-prints for detection of the odor and DNA sequence.",2007-03-09T11:24:28Z
"Charge ordering and coexistence of charge fluctuations in
  quasi-two-dimensional organic conductors $θ$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$","We present a scenario for the peculiar coexistence of charge fluctuations
observed in quasi-2D 1/4-filled organic conductors $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$ in
the quantum critical regime where the charge ordering is suppressed down to
zero temperature. The scenario is explored in the extended Hubbard model
including electron-phonon couplings on an anisotropic triangular lattice. We
find that the coexisting fluctuations emerge from two different instabilities,
the ``Wigner crystallization on lattice'' driven by the off-site Coulomb
repulsion and the charge-density-wave formation due to the nesting of the Fermi
surface, not from phase competition or real-space inhomogeneity. This mechanism
explains the contrastive temperature dependence of two fluctuations in
experiments.",2007-02-28T14:28:10Z
"Magnetic shielding properties of high-temperature superconducting tubes
  subjected to axial fields","We have experimentally studied the magnetic shielding properties of a
cylindrical shell of BiPbSrCaCuO subjected to low frequency AC axial magnetic
fields. The magnetic response has been investigated as a function of the
dimensions of the tube, the magnitude of the applied field and the frequency.
These results are explained quantitatively by employing the method of Brandt
(1998 Phys. Rev. B 58 6506) with a Jc(B) law appropriate for a polycrystalline
material. Specifically, we observe that the applied field can sweep into the
central region either through the thickness of the shield or through the
opening ends, the latter mechanism being suppressed for long tubes. For the
first time, we systematically detail the spatial variation of the shielding
factor (the ratio of the applied field over the internal magnetic field) along
the axis of a high-temperature superconducting tube. The shielding factor is
shown to be constant in a region around the centre of the tube, and to decrease
as an exponential in the vicinity of the ends. This spatial dependence comes
from the competition between two mechanisms of field penetration. The frequency
dependence of the shielding factor is also discussed and shown to follow a
power law arising from the finite creep exponent n.",2007-01-11T11:49:16Z
"The Spitzer/IRS Infrared Spectrum and Abundances of the Planetary Nebula
  IC 2448","We present the mid-infrared spectrum of the planetary nebula IC 2448. In
order to determine the chemical composition of the nebula, we use the infrared
line fluxes from the Spitzer spectrum along with optical line fluxes from the
literature and ultraviolet line fluxes from archival IUE spectra. We determine
an extinction of C(H-beta) = 0.27 from hydrogen recombination lines and the
radio to H-beta ratio. Forbidden line ratios give an electron density of 1860
cm-3 and an average electron temperature of 12700 K. The use of infrared lines
allows us to determine more accurate abundances than previously possible
because abundances derived from infrared lines do not vary greatly with the
adopted electron temperature and extinction, and additional ionization stages
are observed. Elements left mostly unchanged by stellar evolution (Ar, Ne, S,
and O) all have subsolar values in IC 2448, indicating that the progenitor star
formed out of moderately metal deficient material. Evidence from the Spitzer
spectrum of IC 2448 supports previous claims that IC 2448 is an old nebula
formed from a low mass progenitor star.",2007-03-06T00:11:17Z
"Boltzmann conjecture, meta-equilibrium entropy, second law, chaos and
  irreversibility for many body systems","A heuristic generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs microcanonical entropy is
proposed, able to describe meta-equilibrium features and evolution of
macroscopic systems. Despite its simple-minded derivation, such a function of
""collective parameters"" characterizing the microscopic state of N-body systems,
yields, at one time, a statistical interpretation of dynamic evolution, and
dynamic insights on the basic assumption of statistical mechanics. Its natural
(implicit) time dependence entails} a ""Second Law-like"" behaviour and allows
moreover, to perform an elementary test of the Loschmidt reversibility
objection, pointing out the crucial relevance of Chaos in setting up effective
(statistico-mechanical and dynamical) ""arrows of time"". Several concrete
(analytical and numerical) applications illustrate its properties.",2007-02-01T19:23:36Z
Noise Correlations in a Coulomb Blockaded Quantum Dot,"We report measurements of current noise auto- and cross-correlation in a
tunable quantum dot with two or three leads. As the Coulomb blockade is lifted
at finite source-drain bias, the auto-correlation evolves from super-Poissonian
to sub-Poissonian in the two-lead case, and the cross-correlation evolves from
positive to negative in the three-lead case, consistent with transport through
multiple levels. Cross-correlations in the three-lead dot are found to be
proportional to the noise in excess of the Poissonian value in the limit of
weak output tunneling.",2007-03-15T17:21:49Z
Optical probe of electrostatic doping in an n-type Mott insulator,"Electrostatic doping into an $n$-type Mott insulator Sm$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$ has
been successfully achieved with use of the heterojunction with an
  $n$-type band semiconductor Nb-doped SrTiO$_{3}$. The junction exhibits
rectifying current-voltage characteristics due to the interface band
discontinuity and the formation of depleted region. The application of reverse
bias electric field on this junction enables the field-effect electron doping
(presumably up to 6% per Cu atom) to the Mott insulator. The electro-modulation
absorption spectroscopy could clearly show a large modification of the Mott-gap
state accompanying the spectral weight transfer to the lower-energy region,
reminiscent of formation of a metallic state.",2007-02-15T09:21:53Z
"Depth profile high-energy spectroscopic study of Mn-doped GaN prepared
  by thermal diffusion","We have performed an $in$-$situ$ depth profile study of Mn-doped GaN prepared
by a low temperature thermal diffusion method using photoemission and x-ray
absorption spectroscopy. It was revealed from the core-level photoemission
measurements that Mn ions are diffused into a deep ($\sim$ 70 \AA) region of
the GaN substrates and that the line shapes of Mn 3$d$ partial density of
states obtained by resonant photoemission measurements was close to that of
Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N thin films grown by molecular-beam epitaxy. From x-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
measurements at the Mn $L$-edge, it was revealed that the doped Mn ions were in
the divalent Mn$^{2+}$ state and primarily paramagnetic. In magnetization
measurements, weak hysteresis was detected in samples prepared using $p$-type
GaN substrates while samples using $n$-type GaN substrates showed only
paramagnetism.",2007-03-16T10:03:20Z
Avoiding bias in cards cryptography,"We outline the need for stricter requirements for unconditionally secure
cryptographic protocols inspired by the Russian Cards problem. A new
requirement CA4 is proposed that checks for bias in single card occurrence in
announcements consisting of alternatives for players' holdings of cards. This
requirement CA4 is shown to be equivalent to an alternative requirement CA5.
All announcements found to satisfy CA4 are 2-designs. We also show that all
binary designs are 3-designs. Instead of avoiding bias in announcements
produced by such protocols, one may as well apply unbiased protocols such that
patterns in announcements become meaningless. We gave two examples of such
protocols for card deal parameters (3,3,1), i.e. two of the players hold three
cards, and the remaining player, playing the role of eavesdropper, holds a
single card.",2007-02-17T01:42:39Z
"Self-breaking in planar few-atom Au constrictions for nm-spaced
  electrodes","We present results on electromigrated Au nanojunctions broken near the
conductance quantum $77.5 \mu$S. At room temperature we find that wires,
initially narrowed by an actively-controlled electromigration technique down to
a few conductance quanta, continue to narrow after removing the applied
voltage. Separate electrodes form as mobile gold atoms continuously reconfigure
the constriction. We find, from results obtained on over 300 samples, no
evidence for gold cluster formation in junctions broken without an applied
voltage, implying that gold clusters may be avoided by using this self-breaking
technique.",2007-02-26T14:39:16Z
The Second Law and Informatics,"A unification of thermodynamics and information theory is proposed. It is
argued that similarly to the randomness due to collisions in thermal systems,
the quenched randomness that exists in data files in informatics systems
contributes to entropy. Therefore, it is possible to define equilibrium and to
calculate temperature for informatics systems. The obtained temperature yields
correctly the Shannon information balance in informatics systems and is
consistent with the Clausius inequality and the Carnot cycle.",2007-01-03T16:02:43Z
"Negative magnetoresistance and phase slip process in superconducting
  nanowires","We argue that the negative magnetoresistance of superconducting nanowires,
which was observed in recent experiments, can be explained by the influence of
the external magnetic field on the critical current of the phase slip process.
We show that the suppression of the order parameter in the bulk superconductors
made by an external magnetic field can lead to an enhancement of both the first
$I_{c1}$ and the second $I_{c2}$ critical currents of the phase slip process in
nanowires. Another mechanism of an enhancement of $I_{c1}$ can come from
decreasing the decay length of the charge imbalance $\lambda_Q$ at weak
magnetic fields because $I_{c1}$ is inversely proportional to $\lambda_Q$. The
enhancement of the first critical current leads to a larger intrinsic
dissipation of the phase slip process. It suppresses the rate of both the
thermo-activated and/or quantum fluctuated phase slips and results in
decreasing the fluctuated resistance.",2007-01-09T09:59:42Z
Orbital order in ZnV$_2$O$_4$,"In view of recent controversy regarding the orbital order in the frustrated
spinel ZnV2O4, we analyze the orbital and magnetic groundstate of this system
within an ab initio density functional theory approach. While LDA+U
calculations in the presence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilize
an A-type staggered orbital order, the consideration of relativistic spin-orbit
effects unquenches the orbital moment and leads to a uniform orbital order with
a net magnetic moment close to the experimental one. Our results show that ab
initio calculations are able to resolve the existing discrepancies in previous
theories and that it is the spin-orbit coupling alongwith electronic
correlations which play a significant role in determining the orbital structure
in these materials.",2007-01-22T17:56:21Z
The buckling of a swollen thin gel layer bound to a compliant substrate,"Gels are used to design bilayered structures with high residual stresses. The
swelling of a thin layer on a compliant substrate leads to compressive
stresses. The post-buckling of this layer is investigated experimentally; the
wavelengths and amplitudes of the resulting modes are measured. A simplified
model with a self-avoiding rod on a Winkler foundation is in semi-quantitative
agreement with experiments and reproduces the observed cusp-like folds.",2007-01-26T09:18:57Z
Random matrix analysis of complex networks,"We study complex networks under random matrix theory (RMT) framework. Using
nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor spacing distributions we analyze the
eigenvalues of adjacency matrix of various model networks, namely, random,
scale-free and small-world networks. These distributions follow Gaussian
orthogonal ensemble statistic of RMT. To probe long-range correlations in the
eigenvalues we study spectral rigidity via $\Delta_3$ statistic of RMT as well.
It follows RMT prediction of linear behavior in semi-logarithmic scale with
slope being $\sim 1/\pi^2$. Random and scale-free networks follow RMT
prediction for very large scale. Small-world network follows it for
sufficiently large scale, but much less than the random and scale-free
networks.",2007-01-02T22:26:17Z
"Shift of close-packed basal planes as an order parameter of transitions
  between antiferromangetic phases in solid oxygen: II. Temperature/pressure
  dependence of sound velocities and lattice parameters","In the present paper we generalised a phenomenological model developed in
\cite{gomo:2005} for the description of magnetostructural phase transitions and
related peculiarities of elastic properties in solid oxygen under high pressure
and/or low (below 40 K) temperature. We show that variation of all the lattice
parameters in the vicinity of $\alpha\beta$-phase transition is due to both the
shift of basal closed packed planes and appearance of the long-range magnetic
order. Competition between these two factors from one side and lattice
compression below $T_{\alpha\beta}$ from another produces non monotonic
temperature dependence of lattice parameter $b$ (along monoclinic axis). Steep
decrease of the sound velocities in the vicinity of $T_{\alpha\beta}$ can be
explained by the softening of the lattice with respect to shift of the
close-packed planes (described by the constant $K_2$) prior to phase transition
point. We anticipate an analogous softening of sound velocities in the vicinity
of $\alpha \delta$-phase transition and non monotonic pressure dependence of
sound velocities in $\alpha$-phase.",2007-03-13T19:49:34Z
MBE Growth of Cubic InN,"Cubic InN films were grown on top of a c-GaN buffer layer by rf-plasma
assisted MBE at different growth temperatures. X-Ray diffraction investigations
show that the c-InN layers consist of a nearly phase-pure zinc blende (cubic)
structure with a small fraction of the wurtzite (hexagonal) phase grown on the
(111) facets of the cubic layer. The content of hexagonal inclusions is
decreasing with decreasing growth temperature. The full-width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of c-InN (002) rocking curve is about 50 arcmin. Low temperature
photoluminescence measurements reveal a band gap of about 0.61eV for cubic InN.",2007-02-06T13:53:33Z
Superfluidity versus Anderson localization in a dilute Bose gas,"We consider the motion of a quasi one dimensional beam of Bose-Einstein
condensed particles in a disordered region of finite extent. Interaction
effects lead to the appearance of two distinct regions of stationary flow. One
is subsonic and corresponds to superfluid motion. The other one is supersonic,
dissipative and shows Anderson localization. We compute analytically the
interaction-dependent localization length. We also explain the disappearance of
the supersonic stationary flow for large disordered samples.",2007-02-26T10:57:52Z
"Elementary events of electron transfer in a voltage-driven quantum point
  contact","We show that the statistics of electron transfer in a coherent quantum point
contact driven by an arbitrary time-dependent voltage is composed of elementary
events of two kinds: unidirectional one-electron transfers determining the
average current and bidirectional two-electron processes contributing to the
noise only. This result pertains at vanishing temperature while the extended
Keldysh-Green's function formalism in use also enables the systematic
calculation of the higher-order current correlators at finite temperatures.",2007-01-12T16:47:17Z
"Resolution in Focused Electron- and Ion-Beam Induced Chemical Vapor
  Deposition","The key physical processes governing resolution of focused electron-beam and
ion-beam-assisted chemical vapor deposition are analyzed via an adsorption rate
model. We quantify for the first time how the balance of molecule depletion and
replenishment determines the resolution inside the locally irradiated area.
Scaling laws are derived relating the resolution of the deposits to molecule
dissociation, surface diffusion, adsorption, and desorption. Supporting results
from deposition experiments with a copper metalorganic precursor gas on a
silicon substrate are presented and discussed.",2007-03-21T12:23:58Z
Supersymmetry Approach to Almost Diagonal Random Matrices,"We develop a supersymmetric field theoretical description of the Gaussian
ensemble of the almost diagonal Hermitian Random Matrices. The matrices have
independent random entries H_{ij} with parametrically small off-diagonal
elements H_{ij}/H_{ii} ~ B << 1. We derive a regular virial expansion of
correlation functions in the number of ``interacting'' supermatrices associated
with different sites in the real space and demonstrate that the perturbation
theory constructed in this way is controlled by a small parameter B. General
form of the integral expression for the m-th virial coefficient governed by the
``interaction'' of m supermatrices is presented and calculated explicitly in
the cases of 2- and 3-matrix ``interaction''. The suggested technique allows us
to calculate both the spectral correlations and the correlations of the
eigenfunctions taken at different energies and in different space points.",2007-01-18T11:58:15Z
"Generalized true- and eccentric-anomaly parametrizations for the
  perturbed Kepler motion","The true- and eccentric-anomaly parametrizations of the Kepler motion are
generalized to quasiperiodic orbits by considering perturbations of the radial
part of kinetic energy as a series in the negative powers of the orbital
radius. A toolbox of methods for averaging observables in terms of the energy
$E$ and angular momentum $L$ is developed. A broad range of systems governed by
the generic Brumberg force, as well as recent applications of the theory of
gravitational radiation involve integrals over a period of motion. These
integrals are evaluated by using the residue theorem. It is shown that the pole
of the integrand is located in the origin and that under certain circumstances
an additional pole emerges.",2007-01-27T21:47:39Z
"Paths Beyond Local Search: A Nearly Tight Bound for Randomized
  Fixed-Point Computation","In 1983, Aldous proved that randomization can speedup local search. For
example, it reduces the query complexity of local search over [1:n]^d from
Theta (n^{d-1}) to O (d^{1/2}n^{d/2}). It remains open whether randomization
helps fixed-point computation. Inspired by this open problem and recent
advances on equilibrium computation, we have been fascinated by the following
question:
  Is a fixed-point or an equilibrium fundamentally harder to find than a local
optimum? In this paper, we give a nearly-tight bound of Omega(n)^{d-1} on the
randomized query complexity for computing a fixed point of a discrete Brouwer
function over [1:n]^d. Since the randomized query complexity of global
optimization over [1:n]^d is Theta (n^{d}), the randomized query model over
[1:n]^d strictly separates these three important search problems: Global
optimization is harder than fixed-point computation, and fixed-point
computation is harder than local search. Our result indeed demonstrates that
randomization does not help much in fixed-point computation in the query model;
the deterministic complexity of this problem is Theta (n^{d-1}).",2007-02-16T07:32:47Z
1/f Tunnel Current Noise through Si-bound Alkyl Monolayers,"We report low frequency tunnel current noise characteristics of an organic
monolayer tunnel junction. The measured devices, n-Si/alkyl chain (C18H37)/Al
junctions, exhibit a clear 1/ f &#947; power spectrum noise with 1< &#947;
<1.2. We observe a slight bias-dependent background of the normalized current
noise power spectrum (SI/I^2). However, a local increase is also observed over
a certain bias range, mainly if V > 0.4 V, with an amplitude varying from
device to device. We attribute this effect to an energy-dependent trap-induced
tunnel current. We find that the background noise, SI, scales with >. A model
is proposed showing qualitative agreements with our experimental data.",2007-01-19T13:09:26Z
"Mesoscopic structures and 2D hole systems in fully field effect
  controlled heterostructures","Two fundamental extensions to the function of previously described fully
field effect two-dimensional (2D) electron heterostructures are presented:
First, using the same basic heterostructure design of lithographically defined
contacts overlain by both an insulating layer and top-gate employed for
electron systems, appropriate contact material allows a high mobility 2D hole
layer to be populated. Second, a simple method for producing mesoscopic
structures in these devices is presented in which small-scale metallic patterns
are placed on the heterostructure under the insulating and global gate layers
which allows local carrier density tuning via the overlapping gate arrays.
Example devices using these generally applicable methods are demonstrated.",2007-03-27T15:41:04Z
"Evolution of a quantum spin system to its ground state: Role of
  entanglement and interaction symmetry","We study the decoherence of two ferro- and antiferromagnetically coupled
spins that interact with a frustrated spin-bath environment in its ground
state. The conditions under which the two-spin system relaxes from the initial
spin-up - spin-down state towards its ground state are determined. It is shown
that the two-spin system relaxes to its ground state for narrow ranges of the
model parameters only. It is demonstrated that the symmetry of the coupling
between the two-spin system and the environment has an important effect on the
relaxation process. In particular, we show that if this coupling conserves the
magnetization, the two-spin system readily relaxes to its ground state whereas
a non-conserving coupling prevents the two-spin system from coming close to its
ground state.",2007-01-19T23:07:29Z
Wormholes with varying equation of state parameter,"We propose wormholes solutions by assuming space dependent equation of state

arbitrary small quantities of averaged null energy condition (ANEC) violating
phantom energy characterized by variable equation state parameter.",2007-01-04T07:02:04Z
"Cold Attractive Spin Polarized Fermi Lattice Gases and the Doped
  Positive U Hubbard Model","Experiments on polarized fermion gases performed by trapping ultracold atoms
in optical lattices, allow the study of an attractive Hubbard model for which
the strength of the on site interaction is tuned by means of a Feshbach
resonance. Using a well-known particle-hole transformation we discuss how
results obtained for this system can be reinterpreted in the context of a doped
repulsive Hubbard model. In particular we show that the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state corresponds to the striped state
of the two-dimensional doped positive U Hubbard model. We then use the results
of numerical studies of the striped state to relate the periodicity of the FFLO
state to the spin polarization. We also comment on the relationship of the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting phase of the doped 2D repulsive Hubbard model to
a d-wave spin density wave state for the attractive case.",2007-01-26T13:53:57Z
"Calculation of near-field scanning optical images of exciton, charged
  excition and multiexciton wavefunctions in self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum
  dots","The near-field scanning optical microscopy images of excitonic wavefunctions
in self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots are calculated using an empirical
pseudopotential method, followed by the configuration interaction (CI)
treatment of many-particle effects. We show the wavefunctions of neutral
exciton $X^0$ of different polarizations, and compare them to those of the
biexciton $XX$ and the charged excitons $X^+$ and $X^-$. We further show that
the exciton $X(P_h \to S_e)$ transition which is forbidden in the far-field
photoluminescence has comparable intensities to that of $X(S_h \to S_e)$
transition in the near-field photoluminescence .",2007-03-26T14:17:17Z
"Bose-Einstein condensation and Casimir effect for ideal Bose Gas
  confined between two slabs","We study the Casimir effect for a 3-d system of ideal Bose gas in a slab
geometry with Dirichlet boundary condition. We calculate the temperature($T$)
dependence of the Casimir force below and above the Bose-Einstein condensation
temperature($T_c$). At $T\le T_c$ the Casimir force vanishes as
$[\frac{T}{T_c}]^{3/2}$. For $T\gtrsim T_c$ it weakly depends on temperature.
For $T\gg T_c$ it vanishes exponentially. At finite temperatures this force for
thermalized photons in between two plates has a classical expression which is
independent of $\hbar$. At finite temperatures the Casimir force for our system
depends on $\hbar$.",2007-02-08T14:55:22Z
Kinetic Theory of the Heat Capacity of Two-Level Systems,"It is shown that measured heat capacity depends on the rate of the
temperature variation and on the initial state of a system. It is calculated
here in the framework of two-level model. Fenomenological approach gives the
same results.",2007-02-04T15:12:12Z
"Why do ultrasoft repulsive particles cluster and crystallize? Analytical
  results from density functional theory","We demonstrate the accuracy of the hypernetted chain closure and of the
mean-field approximation for the calculation of the fluid-state properties of
systems interacting by means of bounded and positive-definite pair potentials
with oscillating Fourier transforms. Subsequently, we prove the validity of a
bilinear, random-phase density functional for arbitrary inhomogeneous phases of
the same systems. On the basis of this functional, we calculate analytically
the freezing parameters of the latter. We demonstrate explicitly that the
stable crystals feature a lattice constant that is independent of density and
whose value is dictated by the position of the negative minimum of the Fourier
transform of the pair potential. This property is equivalent with the existence
of clusters, whose population scales proportionally to the density. We
establish that regardless of the form of the interaction potential and of the
location on the freezing line, all cluster crystals have a universal Lindemann
ratio L = 0.189 at freezing. We further make an explicit link between the
aforementioned density functional and the harmonic theory of crystals. This
allows us to establish an equivalence between the emergence of clusters and the
existence of negative Fourier components of the interaction potential. Finally,
we make a connection between the class of models at hand and the system of
infinite-dimensional hard spheres, when the limits of interaction steepness and
space dimension are both taken to infinity in a particularly described fashion.",2007-02-09T13:51:20Z
"Ground state lost but degeneracy found: the effective thermodynamics of
  artificial spin ice","We analyze the rotational demagnetization of artificial spin ice, a recently
realized array of nanoscale single-domain ferromagnetic islands.
Demagnetization does not anneal this model system into its anti-ferromagnetic
ground state: the moments have a static disordered configuration similar to the
frozen state of the spin ice materials. We demonstrate that this athermal
system has an effective extensive degeneracy and we introduce a formalism that
can predict the populations of local states in this ice-like system with no
adjustable parameters.",2007-02-14T00:38:18Z
The tail of the contact force distribution in static granular materials,"We numerically study the distribution P(f) of contact forces in frictionless
bead packs, by averaging over the ensemble of all possible force network
configurations. We resort to umbrella sampling to resolve the asymptotic decay
of P(f) for large f, and determine P(f) down to values of order 10^{-45} for
ordered and disordered systems in two and three dimensions. Our findings
unambiguously show that, in the ensemble approach, the force distributions
decay much faster than exponentially: P(f) ~ exp(-f^{\alpha}), with alpha
\approx 2.0 for 2D systems, and alpha \approx 1.7 for 3D systems.",2007-02-22T11:06:44Z
"On the nature of the spin-polarized hole states in a
  quasi-two-dimensional GaMnAs ferromagnetic layer","A self-consistent calculation of the density of states and the spectral
density function is performed in a two-dimensional spin-polarized hole system
based on a multiple-scattering approximation. Using parameters corresponding to
GaMnAs thin layers, a wide range of Mn concentrations and hole densities have
been explored to understand the nature, localized or extended, of the
spin-polarized holes at the Fermi level for several values of the average
magnetization of the Mn ystem. We show that, for a certain interval of Mn and
hole densities, an increase on the magnetic order of the Mn ions come together
with a change of the nature of the states at the Fermi level. This fact
provides a delocalization of spin-polarized extended states anti-aligned to the
average Mn magnetization, and a higher spin-polarization of the hole gas. These
results are consistent with the occurrence of ferromagnetism with relatively
high transition temperatures observed in some thin film samples and
multilayered structures of this material.",2007-02-02T18:09:51Z
Quantum Theory of Cavity-Assisted Sideband Cooling of Mechanical Motion,"We present a fully quantum theory describing the cooling of a cantilever
coupled via radiation pressure to an illuminated optical cavity. Applying the
quantum noise approach to the fluctuations of the radiation pressure force, we
derive the opto-mechanical cooling rate and the minimum achievable phonon
number. We find that reaching the quantum limit of arbitrarily small phonon
numbers requires going into the good cavity (resolved phonon sideband) regime
where the cavity linewidth is much smaller than the mechanical frequency and
the corresponding cavity detuning. This is in contrast to the common assumption
that the mechanical frequency and the cavity detuning should be comparable to
the cavity damping.",2007-01-17T16:29:01Z
"Density Functional Simulation of Spontaneous Formation of Vesicle in
  Block Copolymer Solutions","We carry out numerical simulations of vesicle formation based on the density
functional theory for block copolymer solutions. It is shown by solving the
time evolution equations for concentrations that a polymer vesicle is
spontaneously formed from the homogeneous state. The vesicle formation
mechanism obtained by our simulation agree with the results of other
simulations based on the particle models as well as experiments. By changing
parameters such as the volume fraction of polymers or the Flory-Huggins
interaction parameter between the hydrophobic subchains and solvents, we can
obtain the spherical micelles, cylindrical micelles or bilayer structures, too.
We also show that the morphological transition dynamics of the micellar
structures can be reproduced by controlling the Flory-Huggins interaction
parameter.",2007-01-10T00:03:14Z
"Charge mobility of discotic mesophases: A multiscale quantum/classical

accurate ab-initio description of charge transport in organic materials.",2007-01-16T17:37:15Z
Galaxy Orientations in the Coma Cluster,"We have examined the orientations of early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster
to see whether the well-established tendency for brightest cluster galaxies to
share the same major axis orientation as their host cluster also extends to the
rest of the galaxy population. We find no evidence of any preferential
orientations of galaxies within Coma or its surroundings. The implications of
this result for theories of the formation of clusters and galaxies
(particularly the first-ranked members) are discussed.",2007-03-16T15:51:08Z
"Theory of Electromagnetic Wave Transmission through Metallic Gratings of
  Subwavelength Slits","We present FDTD calculations for transmission of light and other
electromagnetic waves through periodic arrays of slits in a metallic slab. The
results show resonant, frequency dependent, transmittance peaks for
subwavelength widths of the slits which can be up to a factor of ten with
respect to those out of resonance. Although our conclusions agree with previous
work by Lezec and Thio as regards both the magnitude of the enhancement and the
lack of contribution of surface plasmon polaritons of the metal surface to this
effect, we derive an interpretation from a theory that deals with emerging
beam- Rayleigh anomalies of the grating, and with Fabry-Perot resonances of the
perforated slab considered as an effective medium.",2007-03-29T09:47:13Z
"Exact solution of the zero-range process: fundamental diagram of the
  corresponding exclusion process","In this paper, we propose a general way of computing expectation values in
the zero-range process, using an exact form of the partition function. As an
example, we provide the fundamental diagram (the flux-density plot) of the
asymmetric exclusion process corresponding to the zero-range process.We express
the partition function for the steady state by the Lauricella hypergeometric
function, and thereby have two exact fundamental diagrams each for the parallel
and random sequential update rules. Meanwhile, from the viewpoint of
equilibrium statistical mechanics, we work within the canonical ensemble but
the result obtained is certainly in agreement with previous works done in the
grand canonical ensemble.",2007-01-10T07:43:59Z
"Predicted signatures of p-wave superfluid phases and Majorana zero modes
  of fermionic atoms in RF absorption","We study the superfluid phases of quasi-2D atomic Fermi gases interacting via
a p-wave Feshbach resonance. We calculate the absorption spectra of these
phases under a hyperfine transition, for both non-rotating and rotating
superfluids. We show that one can identify the different phases of the p-wave

signatures of the existence of Majorana zero modes at the cores of vortices of
the weakly-pairing $p_x+ip_y$ phase.",2007-01-15T10:14:12Z
Schottky-barrier double-walled carbon nanotube field-effect transistors,"We investigate electronic transport properties of Schottky-barrier
field-effect transistors (FET) based on double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNT)
with a semiconducting outer shell and a metallic inner one. These kind of
DWNT-FET show asymmetries of the $I$-$V$ characteristics and threshold voltages
due to the electron-hole asymmetry of the Schottky barrier. The presence of the
metallic inner shell induces a large effective band gap, which is one order of
magnitude larger than that due to the semiconducting shell alone of a
single-walled carbon nanotube FET.",2007-03-06T09:53:49Z
"A Deficit of Faint Red Galaxies in the Possible Large-Scale Structures
  around the RDCS J1252.9-2927 Cluster at z=1.24","(Abridged) We report a discovery of possible large-scale structures around
the RDCS J1252.9-2927 cluster at z=1.24 based on photometric redshifts. We
carried out multi-band wide-field imaging with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru
Telescope and WFCAM on the United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT). The
distribution of photo-z selected galaxies reveals clumpy structures surrounding
the central cluster. We compare the observed structure with an X-ray map and
find that two of the four plausible clumps show significant X-ray emissions and
one with a marginal detection, which strongly suggest that they are dynamically
bound systems. Following the discovery of the possible large-scale structure,
we carried out deeper SOFI K_s-band imaging with New Technology Telescope on
the four plausible clumps. We construct the optical-to-near-infrared
colour-magnitude diagrams of the galaxies in the clumps, and find that the
colour-magnitude relation (CMR) of the red galaxies in the clumps is sharply
truncated below K_s=22. Interestingly, the main cluster shows a clear relation
down to K_s=23 (Lidman et al. 2004). We suggest that galaxies follow the
'environment-dependent down-sizing' evolution. Massive galaxies in high density
environments first stop forming stars and become red. Less massive galaxies in
less dense environments become red at later times. Based on a few assumptions,
we predict that the brightest tip of the CMR appears at z~2.5.",2007-03-07T02:31:51Z
111Cd- TDPAC study of pressure-induced valence transition in YbAl2,"The quadrupole interaction at 111Cd impurity nuclei in the
intermediate-valence compound YbAl2 has been measured under pressure up to 80
kbar by the TDPAC spectroscopy. It was found that the quadrupole frequency nQ
measured on the 111Cd located at the Al sites in YbAl2, varies nonlinearly and
increases by almost four times with the pressure increase up to 80 kbar. A
linear correlation between the mean Yb valence, derived from Yb L3 OFY-XAS and
RXES measurements, and the electric field gradient (the quadrupole frequency
nQ=eQVzz/h) has been observed. The quadrupole frequencies on 111Cd in the
GdAl2, YbAl3, TmAl3 and CaAl2 compounds have been measured, also. The
possibility of determining the valence of Yb in the Yb compounds with p-metals
from the relation nQ (u(P)) = n2 + (n3 - n2) u(P) has been considered.",2007-03-23T10:01:03Z
Aperture-Angle and Hausdorff-Approximation of Convex Figures,"The aperture angle alpha(x, Q) of a point x not in Q in the plane with
respect to a convex polygon Q is the angle of the smallest cone with apex x
that contains Q. The aperture angle approximation error of a compact convex set
C in the plane with respect to an inscribed convex polygon Q of C is the
minimum aperture angle of any x in C Q with respect to Q. We show that for any
compact convex set C in the plane and any k > 2, there is an inscribed convex
k-gon Q of C with aperture angle approximation error (1 - 2/(k+1)) pi. This
bound is optimal, and settles a conjecture by Fekete from the early 1990s. The
same proof technique can be used to prove a conjecture by Brass: If a polygon P
admits no approximation by a sub-k-gon (the convex hull of k vertices of P)
with Hausdorff distance sigma, but all subpolygons of P (the convex hull of
some vertices of P) admit such an approximation, then P is a (k+1)-gon. This
implies the following result: For any k > 2 and any convex polygon P of
perimeter at most 1 there is a sub-k-gon Q of P such that the
Hausdorff-distance of P and Q is at most 1/(k+1) * sin(pi/(k+1)).",2007-02-16T06:00:08Z
New Consideration on Composed Nonextensive Magnetic Systems,"In this paper a composed A+B magnetic system, with spins J_A=2 and J_B=3/2,
is considered within the mean-field approximation, in the framework of Tsallis
nonextensive statistics. Our motivation is twofold: (1) to approach the
existing experimental data of manganese oxides (manganites), where Mn^{3+} and
Mn^{4+} form two magnetic sublattices, and (2) to investigate the structure of
nonextensive density matrices of composed systems. By imposing that
thermodynamic quantities, such as the magnetization of sublattices A and B,
must be invariant weather the calculation is taken over the total Hilbert space
or over partial subspaces, we found that the expression for the nonextensive
entropy must be adapted. Our argument is supported by calculation of
sublattices magnetization M_A and M_B, internal energy, U_A and U_B, and
magnetic specific heat, CA and CB. It is shown that only with the modified
entropy the two methods of calculation agree to each other. Internal energy and
magnetization are additive, but no clear relationship was found between S_A,
S_B and the total entropy S_{A+B} for q \neq 1. It is shown that the reason for
the failure of the standard way of calculation is the assumption of statistical
independence between the two subsystems, which however does not affect the
density matrix in the full Hilbert space.",2007-01-22T18:36:14Z
"Field sweep rate dependence of magnetic domain patterns: Numerical
  simulations for a simple Ising-like model","We study magnetic domain patterns in ferromagnetic thin films by numerical
simulations for a simple Ising-like model. Magnetic domain patterns after
quench demonstrate various types of patterns depending on the field sweep rate
and parameters of the model. How the domain patterns are formed is shown with
use of the number of domains, the domain area, and domain area distributions as
well as snapshots of domain patterns. Considering the proper time scale of the
system, we propose a criterion for the structure of domain patterns.",2007-02-06T03:23:28Z
The effects of optically induced non-Abelian gauge field in cold atoms,"We show that $N-1$ degenerate dark states can be generated by coupling
$N$-fold degenerate ground states and a common excited state with $N$ laser
fields. Interferences between light waves with different frequencies can
produce laser fields with time-dependent amplitudes, which can induce not only
U(N) non-Abelian vector fields but also the scalar ones for the adiabatic
motion of atoms in such laser fields. As an example, a time-periodic gauge
potential is produced by applying specific laser fields to a tripod system.
Some features of the Landau levels and the ground-state phase diagram of a
rotating Bose-Einstein condensate for a concrete gauge field are also
discussed.",2007-01-19T16:05:44Z
Holonomic constraints : an analytical result,"Systems subjected to holonomic constraints follow quite complicated dynamics
that could not be described easily with Hamiltonian or Lagrangian dynamics. The
influence of holonomic constraints in equations of motions is taken into
account by using Lagrange multipliers. Finding the value of the Lagrange
multipliers allows to compute the forces induced by the constraints and
therefore, to integrate the equations of motions of the system. Computing
analytically the Lagrange multipliers for a constrained system may be a
difficult task that is depending on the complexity of systems. For complex
systems, it is most of the time impossible to achieve. In computer simulations,
some algorithms using iterative procedures estimate numerically Lagrange
multipliers or constraint forces by correcting the unconstrained trajectory. In
this work, we provide an analytical computation of the Lagrange multipliers for
a set of linear holonomic constraints with an arbitrary number of bonds of
constant length. In the appendix of the paper, one would find explicit formulas
for Lagrange multipliers for systems having 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 bonds of constant
length, linearly connected.",2007-01-10T19:25:45Z
"Effect of convective outer layers modeling on non-adiabatic seismic
  observables of delta Scuti stars","The identification of pulsation modes in delta Scuti stars is mandatory to
constrain the theoretical stellar models. The non-adiabatic observables used in
the photometric identification methods depend, however,on convection modeling
in the external layers. Our aim is to determine how the treatment of convection
in the atmospheric and sub-atmospheric layers affects the mode identification,
and what information about the thermal structure of the external layers can be
obtained from amplitude ratios and phase lags in Str\""omgren photometric bands.
We derive non-adiabatic parameters for delta Scuti stars by using, for the
first time, stellar models with the same treatment of convection in the
interior and in the atmosphere. We compute classical non-gray mixing length
models, and as well non-gray ``Full Spectrum of Turbulence'' models.
Furthermore, we compute the photometric amplitudes and phases of pulsation by
using the colors and the limb-darkening coefficents as derived from the same
atmosphere models used in the stellar modeling. We show that the non-adiabatic
phase-lag is mainly sensitive to the thermal gradients in the external layers,
(and hence to the treatment of convection), and that this sensitivity is also
clearly reflected in the multi-color photometric phase differences.",2007-03-15T16:43:49Z
"Probing the Formation of Low Mass X-ray Binaries in Globular Clusters
  and the Field","We present an analysis of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and globular
clusters (GCs) in five galaxies using Chandra, and HST data. Of the 186 LMXBs
within the optical fields 71 are in GCs, confirming that LMXBs are formed
particularly efficiently in GCs. However, there is no statistically significant
correlation between the distance of a GC from the center of its host galaxy and
its LMXB hosting probability. Metal-rich GCs are 3.4 times more likely to host
LMXBs than metal-poor ones. Intriguingly, the LMXBs in NGC 1399 are
preferentially in the reddest GCs of the metal-rich subsystem. This indicates
that the red peak of the color distribution itself encompasses GCs with a range
of enrichment histories. The strength of this effect varies from galaxy to
galaxy, possibly indicating differences in their metal-enrichment histories.
Field LMXBs in our program galaxies are more concentrated towards the center of
their host galaxies than GC-LMXBs. This suggests that a majority of field LMXBs
are formed in situ and have not escaped from current GCs. This is consistent
with previous specific frequency based studies. The brightest LMXBs in GCs
appear to be preferentially associated with luminous, metal-rich clusters. We
show that it is probable that some of these GCs host multiple bright LMXBs,
while the probability is much lower for metal-poor GCs. This implies that LMXBs
in more metal-rich cluster systems should reveal a longer high luminosity X-ray
tail, and show less X-ray variability than metal-poor cluster populations.

Power injected in a granular gas,"A granular gas may be modeled as a set of hard-spheres undergoing inelastic
collisions; its microscopic dynamics is thus strongly irreversible. As pointed
out in several experimental works bearing on turbulent flows or granular
materials, the power injected in a dissipative system to sustain a steady-state
over an asymptotically large time window is a central observable. We describe
an analytic approach allowing us to determine the full distribution of the
power injected in a granular gas within a steady-state resulting from
subjecting each particle independently either to a random force (stochastic
thermostat) or to a deterministic force proportional to its velocity (Gaussian
thermostat). We provide an analysis of our results in the light of the
relevance, for other types of systems, of the injected power to fluctuation
relations.",2007-03-05T14:58:59Z
Distribution of local Lyapunov exponents in spin-glass dynamics,"We investigate the statistical properties of local Lyapunov exponents which
characterize magnon localization in the $d=1$ Heisenberg-Mattis spin glass
(HMSG) at zero temperature, by means of a connection to a suitable version of
the Fokker-Planck (F-P) equation. We consider the local Lyapunov exponents
(LLE), in particular the case of {\em instantaneous} LLE. We establish a
connection between the transfer-matrix recursion relation for the problem, and
an F-P equation governing the evolution of the probability distribution of the
instantaneous LLE. The closed-form (stationary) solutions to the F-P equation
are in excellent accord with numerical simulations, for both the unmagnetized
and magnetized versions of the HMSG. Scaling properties for non-stationary
conditions are derived from the F-P equation in a special limit (in which
diffusive effects tend to vanish), and also shown to provide a close
description to the corresponding numerical-simulation data.",2007-03-16T16:56:23Z
"Lattice Boltzmann method for thermal flow simulation on standard
  lattices","The recently introduced consistent lattice Boltzmann model with energy
conservation [S. Ansumali, I.V. Karlin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 260605 (2005)] is
extended to the simulation of thermal flows on standard lattices. The
two-dimensional thermal model on the standard square lattice with nine
velocities is developed and validated in the thermal Couette and
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard natural convection problems.",2007-03-23T14:25:59Z
Ultra-fast relaxation of electrons in wide-gap dielectrics,"Low-energy electrons scattered in the conduction band of a dielectric solid
should behave like Bloch electrons and will interact with perturbations of the
atomic lattice, i.e. with phonons. Thus the phonon-based description of
low-energy scattering within an energy band structure of a solid bears certain
advantages against common free-electron scattering mechanisms. Moreover, the
inelastic scattering is described by the dielectric energy loss function. With
these collective scattering models we have performed the simulation of excited
electron relaxation and attenuation in the insulator SiO2. After excitation to
a mean initial energy of several eV their energy relaxation occurs within a
short time interval of 200 fs to full thermalization. There is a very rapid
impact ionization cooling connected with cascading of electrons at the
beginning during the first 10 fs, followed by much slower attenuation due to
phonon losses in wide-gap dielectrics and insulators.",2007-02-26T20:39:31Z
"Global phase diagram of the spin-1 antiferromagnet with uniaxial
  anisotropy on the kagome lattice","The phase diagram of the XXZ spin-1 quantum magnet on the kagome lattice is
studied for all cases where the $J_z$ coupling is antiferromagnetic. In the
zero magnetic field case, the six previously introduced phases, found using
various methods, are: the nondegenerate gapped photon phase which breaks no
space symmetry or spin symmetry; the six-fold degenerate phase with plaquette
order, which breaks both time reversal symmetry and translational symmetry; the
""superfluid"" (ferromagnetic) phase with an in-plane global U(1) symmetry
broken, when $J_{xy} < 0$; the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order when $J_{xy} >
0$; the nematic phase when $D < 0$ and large; and a phase with resonating
dimers on each hexagon. We obtain all of these phases and partial information
about their quantum phase transitions in a single framework by studying
condensation of defects in the six-fold plaquette phases. The transition
between nematic phase and the six-fold degenerate plaquette phase is
potentially an unconventional second-order critical point. In the case of a
nonzero magnetic field along $\hat{z}$, another ordered phase with translation
symmetry broken is opened up in the nematic phase. Due to the breaking of
time-reversal symmetry by the field, a supersolid phase emerges between the
six-fold plaquette order and the superfluid phase. This phase diagram might be
accessible in nickel compounds, BF$_4$ salts, or optical lattices of atoms with
three degenerate states on every site.",2007-01-25T21:54:54Z
"Electronic Correlations in CoO2, the Parent Compound of Triangular
  Cobaltates","A 59Co NMR study of CoO2, the x=0 end member of AxCoO2 (A = Na, Li...)
cobaltates, reveals a metallic ground state, though with clear signs of strong
electron correlations: low-energy spin fluctuations develop at wave vectors q
different from 0 and a crossover to a Fermi-liquid regime occurs below a
characteristic temperature T*~7 K. Despite some uncertainty over the exact
cobalt oxidation state n this material, the results show that electronic
correlations are revealed as x is reduced below 0.3. The data are consistent
with NaxCoO2 being close to the Mott transition in the x -> 0 limit.",2007-01-24T12:59:39Z
Magnetotransport and thermoelectricity in disordered graphene,"We have studied the electric and thermal response of two-dimensional
Dirac-fermions in a quantizing magnetic field in the presence of localized
disorder. The electric and heat current operators in the presence of magnetic
field are derived. The self-energy due to impurities is calculated
self-consistently, and depends strongly on the frequency and field strength,
resulting in asymmetric peaks in the density of states at the Landau level
energies, and small islands connecting them. The Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations
remain periodic in 1/B, in spite of the distinct quantization of quasiparticle
orbits compared to normal metals. The Seebeck coefficient depends strongly on
the field strength and orientation. For finite field and chemical potential,
the Wiedemann-Franz law can be violated.",2007-01-29T15:25:17Z
"Strictly correlated electrons in density functional theory: A general
  formulation with applications to spherical densities","We reformulate the strong-interaction limit of electronic density functional
theory in terms of a classical problem with a degenerate minimum. This allows
us to clarify many aspects of this limit, and to write a general solution,
which is explicitly calculated for spherical densities. We then compare our
results with previous approximate solutions and discuss the implications for
density functional theory.",2007-01-01T14:06:32Z
Mixtures of Bose gases under rotation,"We examine the rotational properties of a mixture of two Bose gases.
Considering the limit of weak interactions between the atoms, we investigate
the behavior of the system under a fixed angular momentum. We demonstrate a
number of exact results in this many-body system.",2007-01-31T22:30:10Z
"Non-equilibrium spin dynamics in a trapped Fermi gas with effective
  spin-orbit interaction","We consider a trapped atomic system in the presence of spatially varying
laser fields. The laser-atom interaction generates a pseudospin degree of
freedom (referred to simply as spin) and leads to an effective spin-orbit
coupling for the fermions in the trap. Reflections of the fermions from the
trap boundaries provide a physical mechanism for effective momentum relaxation
and non-trivial spin dynamics due to the emergent spin-orbit coupling. We
explicitly consider evolution of an initially spin-polarized Fermi gas in a
two-dimensional harmonic trap and derive non-equilibrium behavior of the spin
polarization. It shows periodic echoes with a frequency equal to the harmonic
trapping frequency. Perturbations, such as an asymmetry of the trap, lead to
the suppression of the spin echo amplitudes. We discuss a possible experimental
setup to observe spin dynamics and provide numerical estimates of relevant
parameters.",2007-03-19T20:18:39Z
"Orbital Magnetism and Transport Phenomena in Two Dimensional Dirac
  Fermions in Weak Magnetic Field","We discuss the orbital magnetism and the Hall effect in the weak magnetic

related to the graphene sheet, organic conductors, and $d$-density wave
superconductors. We found the strong diamagnetism and finite Hall conductivity
even in gapped systems. We also discuss the relation between the weak-magnetic
field formalism and the Landau quantization with the Euler-Maclaurin expansion.",2007-03-14T14:27:43Z
Excitonic condensation under spin-orbit coupling and BEC-BCS crossover,"The condensation of electron-hole (e-h) pairs is studied at zero temperature
and in the presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the inversion-layer
quantum wells. Under realistic conditions, a perturbative SOC can have
observable effects in the order parameter of the experimentally
long-searched-for excitonic condensate. Firstly, the fermion exchange symmetry
is absent for the e-h pairs indicating a counterexample to the known
classification schemes of fermion pairing. With the lack of fermion exchange,
the condensate spin has no definite parity. Additionally, the excitonic SOC
breaks the rotational symmetry yielding a complex order parameter in an
unconventional way, i.e. the phase pattern of the order parameter is a function
of the condensate density. This is manifested through finite off diagonal
components of the static spin susceptibility, suggesting a new experimental
method to confirm an excitonic condensate.",2007-01-30T14:29:41Z
"Nature of Intermediate States between Superfluid and Mott insulator for
  Interacting Bosons in One-dimension with a Harmonic Trapping Potential","Successive quantum transitions in an intermediate regime are shown to exist
between the superfluid and Mott insulating states for interacting bosonic atoms
in one dimension with a trapping potential. These transitions, which are caused
by the interplay of the trapping potential with the competition between the
kinetic energy and the interaction, reveal novel many-body effects as reflected
by low-lying excitation behavior, unconventional long-range correlations and an
even-odd alternating squeezing process of superfluid bosons into the Mott
insulating state. These features, most likely being generic for all dimensions
when a trapping potential is involved, are relevant for both experimental
observations and physical interpretation of the Mott insulator transition.",2007-01-28T17:20:18Z
"Inverted catenoids, curvature singularities and tethered membranes","If a catenoid is inverted in any interior point, a deflated compact geometry
is obtained which touches at two points (its poles). The catenoid is a minimal
surface and, as such, is an equilibrium shape of a symmetric fluid membrane.
The conformal symmetry of the Hamiltonian implies that inverted minimal
surfaces are also equilibrium shapes. However, they exhibit curvature
singularities at their poles. These singularities are associated with external
forces pulling the poles together. Unlike the catenoid which is free of stress,
there will be stress within the inverted shapes. If the surface area is fixed,
reducing the external force induces a transition from a discocyte to a
cup-shaped stomatocyte.",2007-02-14T00:59:46Z
"A Numerical Treatment of the Rf SQUID: I. General Properties and Noise
  Energy","We investigate the characteristics and noise performance of rf
Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) by solving the
corresponding Langevin equations numerically and optimizing the model
parameters with respect to noise energy. After introducing the basic concepts
of the numerical simulations, we give a detailed discussion of the performance
of the SQUID as a function of all relevant parameters. The best performance is
obtained in the crossover region between the dispersive and dissipative
regimes, characterized by an inductance parameter \beta_L'\equiv 2\pi L
I_0/\Phi_0\approx 1; L is the loop inductance, I_0 the critical current of the
Josephson junction, and \Phi_0 the flux quantum. In this regime, which is not
well explored by previous analytical approaches, the lowest (intrinsic) values
of noise energy are a factor of about 2 above previous estimates based on
analytical approaches. However, several other analytical predictions, such as
the inverse proportionality of the noise energy on the tank circuit quality
factor and the square of the coupling coefficient between the tank circuit and
the SQUID loop, could not be well reproduced. The optimized intrinsic noise
energy of the rf SQUID is superior to that of the dc SQUID at all temperatures.
Although for technologically achievable parameters this advantage shrinks,
particularly at low thermal fluctuation levels, we give an example for
realistic parameters that leads to a noise energy comparable to that of the dc
SQUID even in this regime.",2007-01-29T17:42:40Z
"Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals studied by the
  multi d-orbital tight-binding model","To elucidate the origin of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnetic
transition metals, we study the intrinsic AHE based on a multi-orbital
(xz,yz)-tight-binding model. We find that a large anomalous velocity comes from
the off-diagonal (inter-orbital) hopping. By this reason, the present model
shows a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) which is compatible
with typical experimental values in ferromagnets [100-1000 [1/\Omega cm]],
without necessity to assume a special band structure at the Fermi level. In
good metals where resistivity \rho is small, the intrinsic AHC is constant
(dissipation-less) as found by Karplus and Luttinger. In bad metals, however,
we find that the AHC is proportional to \rho^{-2} when \hbar/2\tau is larger
than the minimum band-splitting measured from the Fermi level. This crossover
behavior of the intrinsic AHE, which was first derived in J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 63
(1994) 2627, is recently observed in various ferromagnetic metals universally
by A. Asamitsu et al. We also stress that the present (xz,yz)-tight binding
model shows a huge spin Hall effect in a paramagnetic state.",2007-01-29T04:27:41Z
"Thermal expansion of Josephson junctions as an elastic response to an
  effective stress field","By introducing a concept of thermal expansion (TE) of a Josephson junction as
an elastic response to an effective stress field, we study (both analytically
and numerically) the temperature and magnetic field dependence of TE
coefficient $\alpha $ in a single small junction and in a square array. In
particular, we found that in addition to {\it field} oscillations due to
Fraunhofer-like dependence of the critical current, $\alpha $ of a small single
junction also exhibits strong flux driven {\it temperature} oscillations near
$T_C$. We also numerically simulated stress induced response of a closed loop
with finite self-inductance (a prototype of an array) and found that $\alpha $
of a $5\times 5$ array may still exhibit temperature oscillations provided the
applied magnetic field is strong enough to compensate for the screening induced
effects.",2007-01-18T18:44:39Z
"A new expression of the probability distribution in incomplete
  statistics and fundamental thermodynamic relations","In order to overcome the limitations of the original expression of the
probability distribution appearing in literature of Incomplete Statistics, a
new expression of the probability distribution is derived, where the Lagrange
multiplier %B% introduced here is proved to be identical with that introduced
in the second and third choices for the internal energy constraint in Tsallis'
statistics and to be just equal to the physical inverse temperature. It is
expounded that the probability distribution described by the new expression is
invariant through uniform translation of the energy spectrum. Moreover, several
fundamental thermodynamic relations are given and the relationship between the
new and the original expressions of the probability distribution is discussed.",2007-03-23T03:06:36Z
"Realization of biferroic properties in La0.6Sr0.4MnO3
  0.7Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3 0.3(PbTiO3) epitaxial superlattices","A set of symmetric and asymmetric superlattices with ferromagnetic
La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 and ferroelectric 0.7Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3 0.3(PbTiO3) as the
constituting layers were fabricated on LaNiO3 coated (100) oriented LaAlO3
substrates using pulsed laser ablation. The crystallinity, magnetic and
ferroelectric properties were studied for all the superlattices. All the
superlattice structures exhibited a ferromagnetic behavior over a wide range of
temperatures between 10K and 300K, whereas only the asymmetric superlattices
exhibited a reasonably good ferroelectric behaviour. Strong influence of an
applied magnetic field was observed on the ferroelectric properties of the
asymmetric superlattices. Studies were conducted towards understanding the
influence of conducting LSMO layers on the electrical responses of the
heterostructures. The absence of ferroelectricity in the symmetric superlattice
structures has been attributed to their high leakage characteristics. The
effect of an applied magnetic field on the ferroelectric properties of the
asymmetric superlattices indicated strong influence of the interfaces on the
properties. The dominance of the interface on the dielectric response was
confirmed by the observed Maxwell Wagner type dielectric relaxation in these
heterostructures.",2007-03-30T09:34:52Z
"Thermo-Mechanical Wave Propagation In Shape Memory Alloy Rod With Phase
  Transformations","Many new applications of ferroelastic materials require a better
understanding of their dynamics that often involve phase transformations. In
such cases, an important prerequisite is the understanding of wave propagation
caused by pulse-like loadings. In the present study, a mathematical model is
developed to analyze the wave propagation process in shape memory alloy rods.
The first order martensite transformations and associated thermo-mechanical
coupling effects are accounted for by employing the modified
Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire theory. The Landau-type free energy function is
employed to characterize different phases, while a Ginzburg term is introduced
to account for energy contributions from phase boundaries. The effect of
internal friction is represented by a Rayleigh dissipation term. The resulted
nonlinear system of PDEs is reduced to a differential-algebraic system, and
Chebyshev's collocation method is employed together with the backward
differentiation method. A series of numerical experiments are performed. Wave
propagations caused by impact loadings are analyzed for different initial
temperatures. It is demonstrated that coupled waves will be induced in the
material. Such waves will be dissipated and dispersed during the propagation
process, and phase transformations in the material will complicate their
propagation patterns. Finally, the influence of internal friction and capillary
effects on the process of wave propagation is analyzed numerically.",2007-02-28T17:45:48Z
"Analytical Solution to Transport in Brownian Ratchets via Gambler's Ruin
  Model","We present an analogy between the classic Gambler's Ruin problem and the
thermally-activated dynamics in periodic Brownian ratchets. By considering each
periodic unit of the ratchet as a site chain, we calculated the transition
probabilities and mean first passage time for transitions between energy minima
of adjacent units. We consider the specific case of Brownian ratchets driven by
Markov dichotomous noise. The explicit solution for the current is derived for
any arbitrary temperature, and is verified numerically by Langevin simulations.
The conditions for vanishing current and current reversal in the ratchet are
obtained and discussed.",2007-01-21T15:27:28Z
"Magnetic anomalies in a spin-chain compound, Sr3CuRhO6:
  Griffiths-phase-like behavior of magnetic susceptibility","We report the results of ac and dc magnetic susceptibility (chi),
heat-capacity (C), isothermal magnetization and isothermal remanent
magnetization measurements on the compound, Sr3CuRhO6, crystallizing in a
K4CdCl6-derived monoclinic structure. The magnetization data reveal distinct
magnetic anomalies near 6 and 12 K with decreasing temperature (T). While the
transition below (To=) 6K appears to be of a spin-glass-type as inferred from
all the data, the one at 12 K is not typical of bulk ferromagnetism in contrast
to an earlier proposal. In the range 6 to 12 K, the dc chi obeys the
theoretically expected form for very low dc fields and the values of chi
decrease gradually with the application of higher magnetic fields, mimicking
the behavior Griffiths-phases.",2007-01-15T16:02:43Z

optimizing InGaN quantum well growth. Superlattice peaks up to 5th order are
clearly resolved in X-ray diffraction. We observe bright green room temperature
photoluminescence (PL) from c-InxGa1-xN/GaN MQWs (x=0.16). The full-width at
half maximum of the PL emission is about 240 meV at 300 K. The PL intensity
increases with well thickness, giving proof that polarization fields which can
limit the performance of the wurtzite III-nitride based devices are absent. The
diffusion length of excess carriers is about 17 nm.",2007-02-05T14:12:13Z
"Renormalised four-point coupling constant in the three-dimensional O(N)
  model with N=0","We simulate self-avoiding walks on a cubic lattice and determine the second
virial coefficient for walks of different lengths. This allows us to determine
the critical value of the renormalized four-point coupling constant in the
three-dimensional N-vector universality class for N=0. We obtain g* =
1.4005(5), where g is normalized so that the three-dimensional
field-theoretical beta-function behaves as \beta(g) = - g + g^2 for small g. As
a byproduct, we also obtain precise estimates of the interpenetration ratio
Psi*, Psi* = 0.24685(11), and of the exponent \nu, \nu = 0.5876(2).",2007-03-05T11:31:43Z
"Nonlinear transport through a dynamic impurity in a strongly interacting
  one-dimensional electron gas","We analyze the transport properties of a Luttinger liquid with an imbedded
impurity of explicitly time-dependent strength. We employ a radiative boundary
condition formalism to describe the coupling to the voltage sources. Assuming
the impurity time dependence to be oscillatory we present a full analytic
perturbative result in impurity strength for arbitrary interaction parameter
calculated with help of Coulomb gas expansion (CGE). Moreover, a full analytic
solution beyond the above restriction is possible for a special non-trivial
interaction strength which has been achieved independently by full resummation
of CGE series as well as via refermionization technique. The resulting
nonlinear current-voltage characteristic turns out to be very rich due to the
presence of the additional energy scale associated with the impurity
oscillation frequency. In accordance with the previous studies we also find an
enhancement of the linear conductance of the wire to values above the unitary
limit G0 = 2e2/h.",2007-02-13T16:11:06Z
The Cluster-Merger Shock in 1E 0657-56: Faster than the Speeding Bullet?,"Shock waves driven in the intergalactic medium during the merging of galaxy
clusters have been observed in X-ray imaging and spectroscopy. Fluid motions
inferred from the shock strength and morphology can be compared to the cold
dark matter (CDM) distribution inferred from gravitational lensing. A detailed
reconstruction of the CDM kinematics, however, must take into account the
nontrivial response of the fluid intracluster medium to the collisionless CDM
motions. We have carried out two-dimensional simulations of gas dynamics in
cluster collisions. We analyze the relative motion of the clusters, the bow
shock wave, and the contact discontinuity and relate these to X-ray data. We
focus on the ""bullet cluster,"" 1E 0657-56, a near head-on collision of
unequal-mass clusters, for which the gas density and temperature jumps across
the prominent bow shock imply a high shock velocity 4,700 km/s. The velocity of
the fluid shock has been widely interpreted as the relative velocity of the CDM
components. This need not be the case, however. An illustrative simulation
finds that the present relative velocity of the CDM halos is 16% lower than
that of the shock. While this conclusion is sensitive to the detailed initial
mass and gas density profile of the colliding clusters, such a decrease of the
inferred halo relative velocity would increase the likelihood of finding 1E
0657-56 in a LambdaCDM universe.",2007-03-09T01:04:31Z
Universality of the single-particle spectra of cuprate superconductors,"All the available data for the dispersion and linewidth of the
single-particle spectra above the superconducting gap and the pseudogap in
metallic cuprates for any doping has universal features. The linewidth is
linear in energy below a scale $\omega_c$ and constant above. The cusp in the
linewidth at $\omega_c$ mandates, due to causality, a ""waterfall"", i.e., a
vertical feature in the dispersion. These features are predicted by a recent
microscopic theory. We find that all data can be quantitatively fitted by the
theory with a coupling constant $\lambda_0$ and an upper cutoff at $\omega_c$
which vary by less than 50% among the different cuprates and for varying
dopings. The microscopic theory also gives these values to within factors of
O(2).",2007-02-07T21:44:13Z
Kinetics of self-induced aggregation in Brownian particles,"We study a model of interacting random walkers that proposes a simple
mechanism for the emergence of cooperation in group of individuals. Each
individual, represented by a Brownian particle, experiences an interaction
produced by the local unbalance in the spatial distribution of the other
individuals. This interaction results in a nonlinear velocity driving the
particle trajectories in the direction of the nearest more crowded regions; the
competition among different aggregating centers generates nontrivial dynamical
regimes. Our simulations show that for sufficiently low randomness, the system
evolves through a coalescence behavior characterized by clusters of particles
growing with a power law in time. In addition, the typical scaling properties
of the general theory of stochastic aggregation processes are verified.",2007-03-16T13:39:20Z
"On The Capacity Deficit of Mobile Wireless Ad Hoc Networks: A Rate
  Distortion Formulation","Overheads incurred by routing protocols diminish the capacity available for
relaying useful data in a mobile wireless ad hoc network. Discovering lower
bounds on the amount of protocol overhead incurred for routing data packets is
important for the development of efficient routing protocols, and for
characterizing the actual (effective) capacity available for network users.
This paper presents an information-theoretic framework for characterizing the
minimum routing overheads of geographic routing in a network with mobile nodes.
specifically, the minimum overhead problem is formulated as a rate-distortion
problem. The formulation may be applied to networks with arbitrary traffic
arrival and location service schemes. Lower bounds are derived for the minimum
overheads incurred for maintaining the location of destination nodes and
consistent neighborhood information in terms of node mobility and packet
arrival process. This leads to a characterization of the deficit caused by the
routing overheads on the overall transport capacity.",2007-03-12T01:11:09Z
Hubble Meets Planck: A Cosmic Peek at Quantum Foam,"If spacetime undergoes quantum fluctuations, an electromagnetic wavefront
will acquire uncertainties in direction as well as phase as it propagates
through spacetime. These uncertainties can show up in interferometric
observations of distant quasars as a decreased fringe visibility. The Very
Large Telescope and Keck interferometers may be on the verge of probing
spacetime fluctuations which, we also argue, have repercussions for cosmology,
requiring the existence of dark energy/matter, the critical cosmic energy
density, and accelerating cosmic expansion in the present era.",2007-01-22T19:36:33Z
Detectability of Mode Resonances in Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries,"Inspirals of neutron star-neutron star binaries are a promising source of
gravitational waves for gravitational wave detectors like LIGO. During the
inspiral, the tidal gravitational field of one of the stars can resonantly
excite internal modes of the other star, resulting in a phase shift in the
gravitational wave signal. We compute using a Fisher-matrix analysis how large
the phase shift must be in order to be detectable. For a $1.4 M_\odot, 1.4
M_\odot$ binary the result is $\sim 8.1, 2.9$ and 1.8 radians, for resonant
frequencies of $16, 32$ and 64 Hz. The measurement accuracies of the other
binary parameters are degraded by inclusion of the mode resonance effect.",2007-01-15T02:32:34Z
Alloying induced degradation of the absorption edge of InAs_{x}Sb_{1-x},"InAs_{x}Sb_{1-x} alloys show a strong bowing in the energy gap, the energy
gap of the alloy can be less than the gap of the two parent compounds. We
demonstrate that a consequence of this alloying is a systematic degradation in
the sharpness of the absorption edge. The alloy disorder induced band-tail
(Urbach tail) characteristics are quantitatively studied for
InAs_{0.05}Sb_{0.95}.",2007-02-22T09:47:28Z
"Excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons in metal films with double
  periodic modulation: anomalous optical effects","We perform a thorough theoretical analysis of resonance effects when an
arbitrarily polarized plane monochromatic wave is incident onto a double
periodically modulated metal film sandwiched by two different transparent
media. The proposed theory offers a generalization of the theory that had been
build in our recent papers for the simplest case of one-dimensional structures
to two-dimensional ones. A special emphasis is placed on the films with the
modulation caused by cylindrical inclusions, hence, the results obtained are
applicable to the films used in the experiments. We discuss a spectral
composition of modulated films and highlight the principal role of
``resonance'' and ``coupling'' modulation harmonics. All the originating
multiple resonances are examined in detail. The transformation coefficients
corresponding to different diffraction orders are investigated in the vicinity
of each resonance. We make a comparison between our theory and recent
experiments concerning enhanced light transmittance and show the ways of
increasing the efficiency of these phenomena. In the appendix we demonstrate a
close analogy between ELT effect and peculiarities of a forced motion of two
coupled classical oscillators.",2007-03-03T18:07:51Z
Incipient Wigner Localization in Circular Quantum Dots,"We study the development of electron-electron correlations in circular
quantum dots as the density is decreased. We consider a wide range of both
electron number, N<=20, and electron gas parameter, r_s<18, using the diffusion
quantum Monte Carlo technique. Features associated with correlation appear to
develop very differently in quantum dots than in bulk. The main reason is that
translational symmetry is necessarily broken in a dot, leading to density
modulation and inhomogeneity. Electron-electron interactions act to enhance
this modulation ultimately leading to localization. This process appears to be
completely smooth and occurs over a wide range of density. Thus there is a
broad regime of ``incipient'' Wigner crystallization in these quantum dots. Our
specific conclusions are: (i) The density develops sharp rings while the pair
density shows both radial and angular inhomogeneity. (ii) The spin of the
ground state is consistent with Hund's (first) rule throughout our entire range
of r_s for all 4<N<20. (iii) The addition energy curve first becomes smoother
as interactions strengthen -- the mesoscopic fluctuations are damped by
correlation -- and then starts to show features characteristic of the classical
addition energy. (iv) Localization effects are stronger for a smaller number of
electrons. (v) Finally, the gap to certain spin excitations becomes small at
the strong interaction (large r_s) side of our regime.",2007-02-28T02:19:29Z
Are Graphene Sheets Stable?,"The answer to the title question is yes and the sheets exhibit diffraction
peaks but may not have long range crystalline order. This is not a trivial
question and answer and is immersing in the very active field now days of the
study of properties of graphite and specially of graphene. This note is
motivated in fact by a recent paper by Meyer et al (1) on the structure of
suspended graphene sheets.",2007-03-20T11:40:56Z
"Multiplicative duality, q-triplet and (mu,nu,q)-relation derived from
  the one-to-one correspondence between the (mu,nu)-multinomial coefficient and
  Tsallis entropy Sq","We derive the multiplicative duality ""q<->1/q"" and other typical mathematical
structures as the special cases of the (mu,nu,q)-relation behind Tsallis
statistics by means of the (mu,nu)-multinomial coefficient. Recently the
additive duality ""q<->2-q"" in Tsallis statistics is derived in the form of the
one-to-one correspondence between the q-multinomial coefficient and Tsallis
entropy. A slight generalization of this correspondence for the multiplicative
duality requires the (mu,nu)-multinomial coefficient as a generalization of the
q-multinomial coefficient. This combinatorial formalism provides us with the
one-to-one correspondence between the (mu,nu)-multinomial coefficient and
Tsallis entropy Sq, which determines a concrete relation among three parameters
mu, nu and q, i.e., nu(1-mu)+1=q which is called ""(mu,nu,q)-relation"" in this
paper. As special cases of the (mu,nu,q)-relation, the additive duality and the
multiplicative duality are recovered when nu=1 and nu=q, respectively. As other
special cases, when nu=2-q, a set of three parameters (mu,nu,q) is identified
with the q-triplet (q_{sen},q_{rel},q_{stat}) recently conjectured by Tsallis.
Moreover, when nu=1/q, the relation 1/(1-q_{sen})=1/alpha_{min}-1/alpha_{max}
in the multifractal singularity spectrum f(alpha) is recovered by means of the
(mu,nu,q)-relation.",2007-02-05T14:51:30Z

"An dynamical-mean-field-theory investigation of specific heat and
  electronic structure of $α$ and $δ$-plutonium","We have carried out a comparative study of the electronic specific heat and
electronic structure of $\alpha$ and $\delta$-plutonium using dynmical mean
field theory (DMFT). We use the perturbative T-matrix and fluctuating exchange
(T-matrix FLEX) as a quantum impurity solver. We considered two different
physical pictures of plutonoium. In the first, $5{f^5}+$, the perturbative
treatment of electronic correlations has been carried out around the
non-magnetic (LDA) Hamiltonian, which results in an f occupation around a bit
above $n_f = 5 $. In the second, $5{f^6}-$, plutonium is viewed as being close
to an $5{f^6}$ configuration, and perturbation theory is carried out around the
(LDA+U) starting point bit below $n_f = 6 $. In the latter case the electronic
specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ attains a smaller value in $\gamma$-Pu than
in $\alpha$-Pu, in contradiction to experiment, while in the former case our
calculations reproduce the experimentally observed large increase of $\gamma$
in $\delta$-Pu as compared to the $\alpha$ phase. This enhancement of the
electronic specific heat coefficient in $\delta$-Pu is due to strong electronic
correlations present in this phase, which cause a substantial increase of the
electronic effective mass, and high density of states at $E_F$. The densities
of states of $\alpha$ and $\delta$-plutonium obtained starting from the
open-shell configuration are also in good agreement with the experimental
photoemission spectra.",2007-02-14T20:42:01Z
"Direct measurement of the effective charge in nonpolar suspensions by
  optical tracking of single particles","We demonstrate a novel technique for the measurement of the charge carried by
a colloidal particle. The technique uses the phenomenon of the resonance of a
particle held in an optical tweezers trap and driven by a sinusoidal electric
field. The trapped particle forms a strongly damped harmonic oscillator whose
fluctuations are a function of $\gamma$, the ratio of the root-mean square
average of the electric and thermal forces on the particle. At low applied
fields, where $\gamma \ll 1$, the particle is confined to the optical axis
while at high fields ($\gamma \gg 1$) the probability distribution of the
particle is double-peaked. The periodically-modulated thermal fluctuations are
measured with nanometer sensitivity using an interferometric position detector.
Charges, as low as a few elementary charges, can be measured with an
uncertainty of about 0.25 $e$. This is significantly better than previous
techniques and opens up new possibilities for the study of nonpolar
suspensions.",2007-01-26T13:05:14Z
"Decoherence induced by anisotropic hyperfine interaction in Si spin
  qubits","We study Si:P donor electron spin decoherence due to anisotropic hyperfine
(AHF) interaction with the surrounding nuclear spin bath. In particular, we
clarify the electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) in the Si:P system
and the resonancelike contributions from nuclear spins in various shells away
from the P atoms. We suggest an approach to minimize AHF-induced decoherence by
avoiding the resonances and orienting an applied magnetic field along
directions that can periodically eliminate contributions from the dominant
nearest neighbor atoms. Our remarkable agreement with experiment demonstrates
nearly complete understanding of electron spin decoherence in Si:P when
combining ESEEM, spectral diffusion, instantaneous diffusion, and spin-lattice
relaxation.",2007-01-15T16:52:36Z
"On Four-group ML Decodable Distributed Space Time Codes for Cooperative
  Communication","A construction of a new family of distributed space time codes (DSTCs) having
full diversity and low Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding complexity is provided
for the two phase based cooperative diversity protocols of Jing-Hassibi and the
recently proposed Generalized Non-orthogonal Amplify and Forward (GNAF)
protocol of Rajan et al. The salient feature of the proposed DSTCs is that they
satisfy the extra constraints imposed by the protocols and are also four-group
ML decodable which leads to significant reduction in ML decoding complexity
compared to all existing DSTC constructions. Moreover these codes have uniform
distribution of power among the relays as well as in time. Also, simulations
results indicate that these codes perform better in comparison with the only
known DSTC with the same rate and decoding complexity, namely the Coordinate
Interleaved Orthogonal Design (CIOD). Furthermore, they perform very close to
DSTCs from field extensions which have same rate but higher decoding
complexity.",2007-01-09T21:12:53Z
Raman frequency shift in oxygen functionalized carbon nanotubes,"In terms of lattice dynamics theory, we study the vibrational properties of
the oxygen-functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes (O-SWCNs). Due to the
C-O and O-O interactions, many degenerate phonon modes are split and even some
new phonon modes are obtained, different from the bare SWCNs. A distinct Raman
shift is found in both the radial breathing mode and G modes, depending not
only on the tube diameter and chirality but also on oxygen coverage and
adsorption configurations. With the oxygen coverage increasing, interesting, a
nonmonotonic up- and down-shift is observed in G modes, which is contributed to
the competition between the bond expansion and contraction, there coexisting in
the functionalized carbon nanotube.",2007-01-16T02:25:16Z
Intrinsic Doping at YBCO-metal Interfaces: Quantitative Results,"Charge redistribution in high-Tc superconductors due to structural defects or
interfaces is known to be crucial for electronic applications as the band
structure is modified on a local scale. In order to investigate these effects
in more detail, we address the normal-state properties of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) in
the vicinity of YBCO-metal interfaces by electronic structure calculations for
well relaxed interface configurations. Our findings can be interpreted in terms
of a band-bending mechanism complemented by local screening effects. We derive
quantitative results for the intrinsic doping of the superconducting CuO2
planes due to the metal interface. In particular, the net charge transfer
amounts to 0.13 electrons in favour of each intraplane copper site, which
appears to be a typical value for interfaces of high-Tc superconductors, thus
opening great possibilities for a systematic optimization of wires and tapes
from high-Tc materials.",2007-02-05T11:08:10Z
"STM Studies of TbTe3: Evidence for a fully Incommensurate Charge Density
  Wave","We observe unidirectional charge density wave ordering on the cleaved surface
of TbTe3 with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope at ~6 K. The modulation
wave-vector q_{CDW} as determined by Fourier analysis is 0.71 +/- 0.02 * 2
pi/c. (Where c is one edge of the in-plane 3D unit cell.) Images at different
tip-sample voltages show the unit cell doubling effects of dimerization and the
layer below. Our results agree with bulk X-ray measurements, with the addition
of ~(1/3) * 2 pi/a ordering perpendicular to the CDW. Our analysis indicates
that the CDW is incommensurate.",2007-01-19T15:59:13Z
"Magneto-elastic effects and magnetization plateaus in two dimensional
  systems","We show the importance of both strong frustration and spin-lattice coupling
for the stabilization of magnetization plateaus in translationally invariant
two-dimensional systems. We consider a frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg model
coupled to adiabatic phonons under an external magnetic field. At zero
magnetization, simple structures with two or at most four spins per unit cell
are stabilized, forming dimers or $2 \times 2$ plaquettes, respectively. A much
richer scenario is found in the case of magnetization $m=1/2$, where larger
unit cells are formed with non-trivial spin textures and an analogy with the
corresponding classical Ising model is detectable. Specific predictions on
lattice distortions and local spin values can be directly measured by X-rays
and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments.",2007-01-08T15:04:42Z
"Rossby waves in ""shallow water"" magnetohydrodynamics","The influence of a toroidal magnetic field on the dynamics of Rossby waves in
a thin layer of ideal conductive fluid on a rotating sphere is studied in the
""shallow water"" magnetohydrodynamic approximation for the first time.
Dispersion relations for magnetic Rossby waves are derived analytically in
Cartesian and spherical coordinates. It is shown that the magnetic field causes
the splitting of low order (long wavelength) Rossby waves into two different
modes, here denoted fast and slow {\em magnetic Rossby waves}. The high
frequency mode (the fast magnetic Rossby mode) corresponds to an ordinary
hydrodynamic Rossby wave slightly modified by the magnetic field, while the low
frequency mode (the slow magnetic Rossby mode) has new and interesting
properties since its frequency is significantly smaller than that of the same
harmonics of pure Rossby and Alfv{\'e}n waves.",2007-03-06T09:18:01Z
"Short-range stationary patterns and long-range disorder in an evolution
  equation for one-dimensional interfaces","A novel local evolution equation for one-dimensional interfaces is derived in
the context of erosion by ion beam sputtering. We present numerical simulations
of this equation which show interrupted coarsening in which an ordered cell
pattern develops with constant wavelength and amplitude at intermediate
distances, while the profile is disordered and rough at larger distances.
Moreover, for a wide range of parameters the lateral extent of ordered domains
ranges up to tens of cells. This behavior is new in the context of dynamics of
surfaces or interfaces with morphological instabilities. We also provide
analytical estimates for the stationary pattern wavelength and mean growth
velocity.",2007-01-23T20:25:47Z
"Kinematics of diffuse ionized gas in the disk halo interface of NGC 891
  from Fabry-Pérot observations","The properties of the gas in halos of galaxies constrain global models of the
interstellar medium. Kinematical information is of particular interest since it
is a clue to the origin of the gas. Here we report observations of the
kinematics of the thick layer of the diffuse ionized gas in NGC 891 in order to
determine the rotation curve of the halo gas. We have obtained a Fabry-P\'erot
data cube in Halpha to measure the kinematics of the halo gas with angular
resolution much higher than obtained from HI 21 cm observations. The data cube
was obtained with the TAURUS II spectrograph at the WHT on La Palma. The
velocity information of the diffuse ionized gas extracted from the data cube is
compared to model distributions to constrain the distribution of the gas and in
particular the halo rotation curve. The best fit model has a central
attenuation tau_H-alpha=6, a dust scale length of 8.1 kpc, an ionized gas scale
length of 5.0 kpc. Above the plane the rotation curve lags with a vertical
gradient of -18.8 km/s/kpc. We find that the scale length of the H-alpha must
be between 2.5 and 6.5 kpc. Furthermore we find evidence that the rotation
curve above the plane rises less steeply than in the plane. This is all in
agreement with the velocities measured in the HI.",2007-03-14T15:19:05Z
"Formation of closed timelike curves in a composite vacuum/dust
  asymptotically-flat spacetime","We present a new asymptotically-flat time-machine model made solely of vacuum
and dust. The spacetime evolves from a regular spacelike initial hypersurface S
and subsequently develops closed timelike curves. The initial hypersurface S is
asymptotically flat and topologically trivial. The chronology violation occurs
in a compact manner; namely the first closed causal curves form at the boundary
of the future domain of dependence of a compact region in S (the core). This
central core is empty, and so is the external asymptotically flat region. The
intermediate region surrounding the core (the envelope) is made of dust with
positive energy density. This model trivially satisfies the weak, dominant, and
strong energy conditions. Furthermore it is governed by a well-defined system
of field equations which possesses a well-posed initial-value problem.",2007-01-03T11:26:24Z
Crystal Shapes and Phase Equilibria: A Common Mathematical Basis,"Geometrical constructions, such as the tangent construction on the molar free
energy for determining whether a particular composition of a solution, is
stable, are related to similar tangent constructions on the
orientation-dependent interfacial energy for determining stable interface
orientations and on the orientation dependence of the crystal growth rate which
tests whether a particular orientation appears on a growing crystal. Subtle
differences in the geometric constructions for the three fields arise from the
choice of a metric (unit of measure). Using results from studies of extensive
and convex functions we demonstrate that there is a common mathematical
structure for these three disparate topics, and use this to find new uses for
well-known graphical methods for all three topics. Thus the use of chemical
potentials for solution thermodynamics is very similar to known vector
formulations for surface thermodynamics, and the method of characteristics
which tracks the interfaces of growing crystals; the Gibbs-Duhem equation is
analogous to the Cahn-Hoffman equation. The Wulff construction for equilibrium
crystal shapes can be modified to construct a ``phase shape'' from solution
free energies that is a potentially useful method of numerical calculations of
phase diagrams from known thermodynamical data.",2007-03-21T22:53:49Z
"Itinerant in-plane magnetic fluctuations and many-body correlations in
  Na$_x$CoO$_2$","Based on the {\it ab-initio} band structure for Na$_x$CoO$_2$ we derive the
single-electron energies and the effective tight-binding description for the
$t_{2g}$ bands using projection procedure. Due to the presence of the
next-nearest-neighbor hoppings a local minimum in the electronic dispersion
close to the $\Gamma$ point of the first Brillouin zone forms. Correspondingly,
in addition to a large Fermi surface an electron pocket close to the $\Gamma$
point emerges at high doping concentrations. The latter yields the new
scattering channel resulting in a peak structure of the itinerant magnetic
susceptibility at small momenta. This indicates dominant itinerant in-plane
ferromagnetic fluctuations above certain critical concentration $x_m$, in
agreement with neutron scattering data. Below $x_m$ the magnetic susceptibility
shows a tendency towards the antiferromagnetic fluctuations. We further analyze
the many-body effects on the electronic and magnetic excitations using various
approximations applicable for different $U/t$ ratio.",2007-01-30T19:09:42Z
"Steady-State Probe-Partitioning FRET: A Simple and Robust Tool for the

energy transfer between freely diffusing membrane probe populations, and it is
well suited for the rapid generation of large data sets. Presented in this

"Natural Phantom Dark Energy, Wiggling Hubble Parameter $H(z)$ and Direct
  $H(z)$ Data","Recent direct $H(z)$ data indicate that the parameter $H(z)$ may wiggle with
respect to $z$. On the other hand the luminosity distance data of supernovae
flatten the wiggles of $H(z)$ because of integration effect. It is expected
that the fitting results can be very different in a model permitting a wiggling
$H(z)$ because the data of supernovae is highly degenerated to such a model. As
an example the natural phantom dark energy is investigated in this paper. The
dynamical property of this model is studied. The model is fitted by the direct
$H(z)$ data set and the SNLS data set, respectively. And the results are quite
different, as expected. The quantum stability of this model is also shortly
discussed. We find it is a viable model if we treat it as an effective theory
truncated by an upperbound.",2007-03-11T04:12:06Z
Herbig-Haro flows in L1641N,"We have used the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) to observe two deep
fields in L1641N, selected on the basis of previous shock studies, using the
2.12 micron transition of H2 (and a Ks filter to sample the continuum) for a
total exposure time of 4.6 h (72 min Ks) in the overlapping region. The
resulting high-resolution mosaic shows numerous new shocks and resolves many
known shocks into multiple components. Using previous observations taken 9
years earlier we calculate a proper motion map and combine this with Spitzer 24
micron observations of the embedded young stars. The combined H2 mosaic shows
many new shocks and faint structures in the HH flows. From the proper motion
map we find that most HH objects belong to two major bi-polar HH flows, the
large-scale roughly North-South oriented flow from central L1641N and a
previously unseen HH flow in eastern L1641N. Combining the tangential velocity
map with the mid-IR Spitzer images, two very likely outflow sources are found.
The outflow source of the eastern flow, L1641N-172, is found to be the
currently brightest mid-IR source in L1641N and seem to have brightened
considerably during the past 20 years. We make the first detection of this
source in the near-IR (Ks) and also find a near-IR reflection nebula pointing
at the source, probably the illuminated walls of a cone-shaped cavity cleared
out by the eastern lobe of the outflow. Extending a line from the eastern
outflow source along the proper motion vector we find that HH 301 and HH 302
(almost 1 pc away) belong to this new HH flow.",2007-03-06T19:27:51Z
Hydrogen Absorption Properties of Metal-Ethylene Complexes,"Recently, we have predicted [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 226102 (2006)] that a
single ethylene molecule can form stable complexes with light transition metals
(TM) such as Ti and the resulting TMn-ethylene complex can absorb up to ~12 and
14 wt % hydrogen for n=1 and 2, respectively. Here we extend this study to
include a large number of other metals and different isomeric structures. We
obtained interesting results for light metals such as Li. The ethylene molecule
is able to complex with two Li atoms with a binding energy of 0.7 eV/Li which
then binds up to two H2 molecules per Li with a binding energy of 0.24 eV/H2
and absorption capacity of 16 wt %, a record high value reported so far. The
stability of the proposed metal-ethylene complexes was tested by extensive
calculations such as normal-mode analysis, finite temperature first-principles
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and reaction path calculations. The phonon
and MD simulations indicate that the proposed structures are stable up to 500
K. The reaction path calculations indicate about 1 eV activation barrier for
the TM2-ethylene complex to transform into a possible lower energy
configuration where the ethylene molecule is dissociated. Importantly, no
matter which isometric configuration the TM2-ethylene complex possesses, the TM
atoms are able to bind multiple hydrogen molecules with suitable binding energy
for room temperature storage. These results suggest that co-deposition of
ethylene with a suitable precursor of TM or Li into nanopores of light-weight
host materials may be a very promising route to discovering new materials with
high-capacity hydrogen absorption properties.",2007-01-23T20:49:52Z
"Organic small molecule field-effect transistors with Cytop(TM) gate
  dielectric: eliminating gate bias stress effects","We report on organic field-effect transistors with unprecedented resistance
against gate bias stress. The single crystal and thin-film transistors employ
the organic gate dielectric Cytop(TM). This fluoropolymer is highly water
repellent and shows a remarkable electrical breakdown strength. The single
crystal transistors are consistently of very high electrical quality: near zero
onset, very steep subthreshold swing (average: 1.3 nF V/(dec cm2)) and
negligible current hysteresis. Furthermore, extended gate bias stress only
leads to marginal changes in the transfer characteristics. It appears that
there is no conceptual limitation for the stability of organic semiconductors
in contrast to hydrogenated amorphous silicon.",2007-02-20T18:03:08Z
Universality in the BCS - BEC Crossover in Cold Fermion Gases,"We address the finite temperature phase diagram of ultracold fermionic atoms
across a Feshbach resonance based on a functional integral for an atom-molecule
model. This allows to fully exploit the presence of the global symmetry of
phase rotations, U(1). Both the equation of state and the classification of the
thermodynamic phases are obtained from a symmetry consideration. We focus on
the universal aspects associated to narrow and broad resonances, in turn
connected by an additional form of crossover. The narrow resonance limit can be
solved exactly above the critical temperature. We also assess deviations from
the broad resonance universality which have recently been probed
experimentally.",2007-01-08T23:02:24Z
Unusual liquid state of hard-core bosons on the pyrochlore lattice,"We study the physics of hard-core bosons with unfrustrated hopping (t) and
nearest-neighbor repulsion (V) on the three dimensional pyrochlore lattice. At
half-filling, we demonstrate that the small V/t superfluid state eventually
becomes unstable at large enough V/t to an unusual insulating state which
displays no broken lattice translation symmetry. Equal time and static density
correlators in this insulator are well described by a mapping to electric field
correlators in the Coulomb phase of a U(1) lattice gauge theory, allowing us to
identify this insulator with a U(1) fractionalized Mott-insulating state. The
possibility of observing this phase in suitably designed atom-trap experiments
with ultracold atoms is also discussed, as are specific experimental
signatures.",2007-02-01T21:04:40Z
"ALBUM: a tool for the analysis of slitless spectra and its application
  to ESO WFI data","ALBUM is a general-purpose tool to visualize and screen large amounts of
slitless spectra. It was developed for a search for emission-line stars in SMC
and LMC clusters. The observations were obtained with ESO's Wide Field Imager
(WFI) and comprise ~8 million low-resolution spectra. The tool as well as the
results of its application to the SMC part of the database are presented. The
inferred frequency of Be stars is compared to the one in the higher-metallicity
environment of the Milky Way.",2007-03-23T10:19:45Z
"Gas Accretion by Globular Clusters and Nucleated Dwarf Galaxies and the
  Formation of the Arches and Quintuplet Clusters","We consider here the collective accretion of gas by globular clusters and
dwarf galaxies moving through the interstellar medium. In the limit of high
velocity and/or sound speed of the ISM, the collective potential of the cluster
is insufficient to accrete significant amounts of gas, and stars within the
systems accrete gas individually. We show, however, that when the sound speed
or the relative velocity of the ambient medium is less than the central
velocity dispersion of the cluster, it is accreted into the collective
potential of the cluster prior to being accreted onto the individual stars
within the cluster. The collective rate is strongly enhanced relative to the
individual rates. This effect may potentially modify the white dwarf cooling
sequence in globular clusters with low-inclination and low-eccentricity
Galactic orbits, and lead to the rejuvenation of some marginally surviving
cores of globular clusters and nucleated dwarf galaxies near the Galactic
center. Such effects will only occur rarely, but may explain the existence of
clusters of young, massive stars near the Galactic center.",2007-03-30T18:12:12Z
Canonical Realizations of Doubly Special Relativity,"Doubly Special Relativity is usually formulated in momentum space, providing
the explicit nonlinear action of the Lorentz transformations that incorporates
the deformation of boosts. Various proposals have appeared in the literature
for the associated realization in position space. While some are based on
noncommutative geometries, others respect the compatibility of the spacetime
coordinates. Among the latter, there exist several proposals that invoke in
different ways the completion of the Lorentz transformations into canonical
ones in phase space. In this paper, the relationship between all these
canonical proposals is clarified, showing that in fact they are equivalent. The
generalized uncertainty principles emerging from these canonical realizations
are also discussed in detail, studying the possibility of reaching regimes
where the behavior of suitable position and momentum variables is classical,
and explaining how one can reconstruct a canonical realization of doubly
special relativity starting just from a basic set of commutators. In addition,
the extension to general relativity is considered, investigating the kind of
gravity's rainbow that arises from this canonical realization and comparing it
with the gravity's rainbow formalism put forward by Magueijo and Smolin, which
was obtained from a commutative but noncanonical realization in position space.",2007-02-05T17:32:20Z
Interminiband Rabi oscillations in biased semiconductor superlattices,"Carrier dynamics at energy level anticrossings in biased semiconductor
superlattices, was studied in the time domain by solving the time-dependent
Schroedinger equation. The resonant nature of interminiband Rabi oscillations
has been explicitly demonstrated to arise from interference of intrawell and
Bloch oscillations. We also report a simulation of direct Rabi oscillations
across three minibands, in the high field regime, due to interaction between
three strongly coupled minibands.",2007-02-08T21:33:08Z
Selective epitaxial growth of GaAs on Ge by MOCVD,"We have selectively grown thin epitaxial GaAs films on Ge substrates with the
aid of a 200 nm thin SiO2 mask layer. The selectively grown structures have
lateral sizes ranging from 1 um width up to large areas of 1 by 1 mm2. The
growth with the standard growth procedure for GaAs growth on Ge substrates
reveals a limited amount of GaAs nucleation on the mask area and strong loading
effects caused by diffusion of group III precursors over the mask area and in
the gas phase. Reduction of the growth pressure inhibits GaAs nucleation on the
mask area and reduces the loading effects strongly, but favors the creation of
anti phase domains in the GaAs. An optimized growth procedure was developed,
consisting of a 13 nm thin nucleation layer grown at high pressure, followed by
low pressure growth of GaAs. This optimized growth procedure inhibits the
nucleation of GaAs on the mask area and is a good compromise between reduction
of loading effects and inhibition of anti phase domain growth in the GaAs.
X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements demonstrate the good
microscopic characteristics of the selectively grown layers.",2007-03-26T08:19:07Z
"Formation of optimal-order necklace modes in one-dimensional random
  photonic superlattices","We study the appearance of resonantly coupled optical modes, optical
necklaces, in Anderson localized one-dimensional random superlattices through
numerical calculations of the accumulated phase. The evolution of the optimal
necklace order m* shows a gradual shift towards higher orders with increasing
the sample size. We derive an empirical formula that predicts m* and discuss
the situation when in a sample length L the number of degenerate in energy
resonances exceeds the optimal one. We show how the \emph{extra} resonances are
pushed out to the miniband edges of the necklace, thus reducing the order of
the latter by multiples of two.",2007-01-23T11:21:48Z
"White Noise from Dark Matter: 21 cm Observations of Early Baryon
  Collapse","In concordance cosmology, dark matter density perturbations generated by
inflation lead to nonlinear, virialized minihalos, into which baryons collapse
at redshift $z \sim 20$. We survey here novel baryon evolution produced by a
modification of the power spectrum from white noise density perturbations at
scales below $k \sim 10 h {Mpc}^{-1}$ (the smallest scales currently measured
with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest). Exotic dark matter dynamics, such as would
arise from scalar dark matter with a late phase transition (similar to an
axion, but with lower mass), create such an amplification of small scale power.
The dark matter produced in such a phase transition collapses into minihalos,
with a size given by the dark matter mass within the horizon at the phase
transition. If the mass of the initial minihalos is larger than $\sim 10^{-3}
M_\odot$, the modified power spectrum is found to cause widespread baryon
collapse earlier than standard $\Lambda$CDM, leading to earlier gas heating. It
also results in higher spin temperature of the baryons in the 21 cm line
relative to $\Lambda$CDM at redshifts $z > 20$ if the mass of the minihalo is
larger than $1 M_\odot$. It is estimated that experiments probing 21 cm
radiation at high redshift will contribute a significant constraint on dark
matter models of this type for initial minihalos larger than $\sim 10 M_\odot$.
Early experiments reaching to $z\approx 15$ will constrain minihalos down to
$\sim 10^3 M_\odot$.",2007-03-26T18:45:06Z
"Structure and energetics of solvated ferrous and ferric ions:
  Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics in the DFT+U formalism","We implemented a rotationally-invariant Hubbard U extension to
density-functional theory in the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics framework,
with the goal of bringing the accuracy of the DFT+U approach to
finite-temperature simulations, especially for liquids or solids containing
transition-metal ions. First, we studied the effects on the Hubbard U on the
static equilibrium structure of the hexa-aqua ferrous and ferric ions, and the
inner-sphere reorganization energy for the electron-transfer reaction between
aqueous ferrous and ferric ions. It is found that the reorganization energy is
increased, mostly as a result of the Fe-O distance elongation in the hexa-aqua
ferrous ion. Second, we performed a first-principles molecular dynamics study
of the solvation structure of the two aqueous ferrous and ferric ions. The
Hubbard term is found to change the Fe-O radial distribution function for the
ferrous ion, while having a negligible effect on the aqueous ferric ion.
Moreover, the frequencies of vibrations between Fe and oxygen atoms in the
first-solvation shell are shown to be unaffected by the Hubbard corrections for
both ferrous and ferric ions.",2007-01-12T00:52:42Z
Polyfluorene as a model system for space-charge-limited conduction,"Ethyl-hexyl substituted polyfluorene (PF) with its high level of molecular
disorder can be described very well by one-carrier space-charge-limited
conduction for a discrete set of trap levels with energy $\sim$ 0.5 eV above
the valence band edge. Sweeping the bias above the trap-filling limit in the
as-is polymer generates a new set of exponential traps, which is clearly seen
in the density of states calculations. The trapped charges in the new set of
traps have very long lifetimes and can be detrapped by photoexcitation. Thermal
cycling the PF film to a crystalline phase prevents creation of additional
traps at higher voltages.",2007-03-21T19:16:56Z
"Plane waves in a relativistic homogeneous and isotropic elastic
  continuum","Propagation of gravitational and acoustic plane waves in a flat universe
filled with a general relativistic, homogeneous and isotropic, spatially flat
continuum is studied. The continuum is described by analogues of
nonrelativistic characteristics, namely energy per particle, pressure and Lame
coefficients, and considered in the comoving proper-time gauge. For all modes
with the given wave covector, differential equations governing the time
dependence of the amplitudes are derived. In particular, longitudinal acoustic
waves are described, in analogy with the nonrelativistic theory, by two coupled
first-order equations. As an example, plane waves in a stiff ultrarigid
continuum are considered.",2007-01-10T16:17:27Z
The structure of suspended graphene sheets,"The recent discovery of graphene has sparked significant interest, which has
so far been focused on the peculiar electronic structure of this material, in
which charge carriers mimic massless relativistic particle. However, the
structure of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a
honeycomb crystal lattice - is also puzzling. On the one hand, graphene appears
to be a strictly two-dimensional (2D) material and exhibits such a high crystal
quality that electrons can travel submicron distances without scattering. On
the other hand, perfect 2D crystals cannot exist in the free state, according
to both theory and experiment. This is often reconciled by the fact that all
graphene structures studied so far were an integral part of larger 3D
structures, either supported by a bulk substrate or embedded in a 3D matrix.
Here we report individual graphene sheets freely suspended on a microfabricated
scaffold in vacuum or air. These membranes are only one atom thick and still
display a long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) have revealed that suspended graphene sheets are not
perfectly flat but exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the
surface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1
nm. The atomically-thin single-crystal membranes offer an ample scope for
fundamental research and new technologies whereas the observed corrugations in
the third dimension may shed light on subtle reasons behind the stability of 2D
crystals.",2007-01-16T19:16:56Z
Quantum healing of classical singularities in power-law spacetimes,"We study a broad class of spacetimes whose metric coefficients reduce to
powers of a radius r in the limit of small r. Among these four-parameter
""power-law"" metrics we identify those parameters for which the spacetimes have
classical singularities as r approaches 0. We show that a large set of such
classically singular spacetimes is nevertheless nonsingular quantum
mechanically, in that the Hamiltonian operator is essentially self-adjoint, so
that the evolution of quantum wave packets lacks the ambiguity associated with
scattering off singularities. Using these metrics, the broadest class yet
studied to compare classical with quantum singularities, we explore the
physical reasons why some that are singular classically are ""healed"" quantum
mechanically, while others are not. We show that most (but not all) of the
remaining quantum-mechanically singular spacetimes can be excluded if either
the weak energy condition or the dominant energy condition is invoked, and we
briefly discuss the effect of this work on the strong cosmic censorship
hypothesis.",2007-01-27T18:35:24Z
Fermi surface and pseudogap in electron-doped cuprates,"Spectral functions are evaluated numerically within the t-t'-J model as
relevant for electron-doped cuprates. The Fermi surface develops from a
pocket-like into a large one with doping. The corresponding pseudogap in the
nodal direction is well resolved at low doping and vanishes at intermediate
doping. Its presence is strongly temperature dependent and thus connected to
longer-range antiferromagnetic correlations. Features including double
effective band and optical conductivity are consistent with experiments on
electron-doped cuprates without invoking the closing of the Mott-Hubbard gap.",2007-02-27T15:36:17Z
"Dirac Notation, Fock Space and Riemann Metric Tensor in Information
  Retrieval Models","Using Dirac Notation as a powerful tool, we investigate the three classical
Information Retrieval (IR) models and some their extensions. We show that
almost all such models can be described by vectors in Occupation Number
Representations (ONR) of Fock spaces with various specifications on, e.g.,
occupation number, inner product or term-term interactions. As important cases
of study, Concept Fock Space (CFS) is introduced for Boolean model; the basic
formulas for Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of Latent Semantic Indexing
(LSI) Model are manipulated in terms of Dirac notation. And, based on SVD, a
Riemannian metric tensor is introduced, which not only can be used to calculate
the relevance of documents to a query, but also may be used to measure the
closeness of documents in data clustering.",2007-01-23T01:22:59Z
Probing Noncommutativity with Inflationary Gravitational Waves,"In this paper we study the behaviour of gravitational wave background (GWB)
generated during inflation in the environment of the noncommutative field
approach. From this approach we derive out one additive term, and then we find
that the dispersion relation of the gravitational wave would be modified and
the primordial gravitational wave would obtain an effective mass. Therefore it
breaks lorentz symmetry in local. Moreover, this additive term would a little
raise up the energy spectrum of GWB in low frequency and then greatly suppress
the spectrum at even lower energy scale of which the wave length may be near
the current horizon. Therefore, a sharp peak is formed on the energy spectrum
in the range of low frequencies. This peak should be a key criterion to detect
the possible existence of noncommutativity of space-time in the background of
our universe and a critical test for breaking lorentz symmetry in local field
theory. Adding all possible effects on the evolution of GWB, we give some new
information of the tensor power spectrum and its energy spectrum which may be
probed in the future cosmological observations.",2007-01-21T14:11:42Z
"Anomalous thermal expansion and strong damping of the thermal
  conductivity of NdMnO$_3$ and TbMnO$_3$ due to 4f crystal-field excitations","We present measurements of the thermal conductivity $\kappa $ and the thermal
expansion $\alpha$ of NdMnO$_3$ and TbMnO$_3$. In both compounds a splitting of
the $4f$ multiplet of the $R^{3+}$ ion causes Schottky contributions to
$\alpha$. In TbMnO$_3$ this contribution arises from a crystal-field splitting,
while in NdMnO$_3$ it is due to the Nd-Mn exchange coupling. Another
consequence of this coupling is a strongly enhanced canting of the Mn moments.
The thermal conductivity is greatly suppressed in both compounds. The main
scattering process at low temperatures is resonant scattering of phonons
between different energy levels of the $4f$ multiplets, whereas the complex 3d
magnetism of the Mn ions is of minor importance.",2007-03-08T18:48:48Z
Magneto and ferroelectric phase transitions in HoMn2O5 monocrystals,"From the physical point of view multiferroics present an extremely
interesting class of systems and problems. These are essentially of two kinds.
One is what are the microscopic conditions, and sometimes constrains, which
determine the possibility to combine in one system both magnetic and
ferroelectric properties. This turned out to be a quite nontrivial question,
and usually, in conventional systems, these two phenomena tend to exclude one
another. Why it is the case is an important and still not completely resolved
issue. In the present article we report our results from magnetic properties
measurements on HoMn2O5 with short discussion about it possible origin.",2007-01-27T18:28:24Z
Phonon dispersion in graphene,"Taking into account the constraints imposed by the lattice symmetry, the
phonon dispersion is calculated for graphene with interactions between the
first and second nearest neighbors in the framework of the Born-von Karman
model. Analytical expressions are obtained for the out-of-plane (bending) modes
determined only by two force constants as well as for the in-plane modes with
four force constants. Values of the force constants are found in fitting to
elastic constants and Raman frequencies observed in graphite.",2007-02-17T20:08:37Z
Virial coefficients and demixing of athermal nonadditive mixtures,"We compute the fourth virial coefficient of a binary nonadditive hard-sphere
mixture over a wide range of deviations from diameter additivity and size
ratios. Hinging on this knowledge, we build up a $y$ expansion [B. Barboy and
W. N. Gelbart, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 71}, 3053 (1979)] in order to trace the
fluid-fluid coexistence lines which we then compare with the available
Gibbs-ensemble Monte Carlo data and with the estimates obtained through two
refined integral-equation theories of the fluid state. We find that in a regime
of moderately negative nonadditivity and largely asymmetric diameters, relevant
to the modelling of sterically and electrostatically stabilized colloidal
mixtures, the fluid-fluid critical point is unstable with respect to
crystallization.",2007-03-01T17:42:33Z
"Contractor-Renormalization approach to frustrated magnets in magnetic
  field","We propose to use the Contractor Renormalization (CORE) technique in order to
derive effective models for quantum magnets in a magnetic field. CORE is a
powerful non-perturbative technique that can reduce the complexity of a given
microscopic model by focusing on the low-energy part. We provide a detailed
analysis of frustrated spin ladders which have been widely studied in the past:
in particular, we discuss how to choose the building block and emphasize the
use of their reduced density matrix. With a good choice of basis, CORE is able
to reproduce the existence or not of magnetization plateaux in the whole phase
diagram contrary to usual perturbation theory. We also address the issue of
plateau formation in two-dimensional bilayers and point out the analogy between
non-frustrated strongly anisotropic models and frustrated SU(2) ones.",2007-03-22T16:33:15Z
"22nd order high-temperature expansion of nearest-neighbor models with
  O(2) symmetry on a simple cubic lattice","We present the high-temperature series for a nearest-neighbor model with O(2)
symmetry on a simple cubic lattice with the most general single-site potential.
In particular, the magnetic susceptibility and the second-moment correlation
length are computed to 22nd order. The series specialized to some particular
improved Hamiltonians have been already analyzed in the paper M. Campostrini,
M. Hasenbusch, A. Pelissetto, and E. Vicari, Phys. Rev. B 74, 144506 (2006)

"Magnetic irreversibility and Verwey transition in nano-crystalline
  bacterial magnetite","The magnetic properties of biologically-produced magnetite nanocrystals
biomineralized by four different magnetotactic bacteria were compared to those
of synthetic magnetite nanocrystals and large, high quality single crystals.
The magnetic feature at the Verwey temperature, $T_{V}$, was clearly seen in
all nanocrystals, although its sharpness depended on the shape of individual
nanoparticles and whether or not the particles were arranged in magnetosome
chains. The transition was broader in the individual superparamagnetic
nanoparticles for which $T_{B}<T_{V}$, where $T_{B}$ is the superparamagnetic
blocking temperature. For the nanocrystals organized in chains, the effective
blocking temperature $T_{B}>T_{V}$ and the Verwey transition is sharply
defined. No correlation between the particle size and $T_{V}$ was found.
Furthermore, measurements of $M(H,T,time)$ suggest that magnetosome chains
behave as long magnetic dipoles where the local magnetic field is directed
along the chain and this result confirms that time-logarithmic magnetic
relaxation is due to the collective (dipolar) nature of the barrier for
magnetic moment reorientation.",2007-03-12T19:08:27Z
"Multiple Potentials of Mean Force from Biased Experiments Along a Single
  Coordinate","External biasing forces are often applied to enhance sampling in regions of
phase space which would otherwise be rarely observed. While the typical goal of
these experiments is to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) along the
biasing coordinate, here I present a method to construct PMFs in multiple
dimensions and along arbitary alternative degrees of freedom. A protocol for
multidimensional PMF reconstruction from nonequilibrium single-molecule pulling
experiments is introduced and tested on a series of two dimensional potential
surfaces with varying levels of correlation. Reconstruction accuracy and
convergence from several methods - this new protocol, equilibrium umbrella
sampling, and free diffusion - are compared, and nonequilibrium pulling is
found to be the most efficient. To facilitate the use of this method, the
source code for this analysis is made freely available.",2007-01-05T18:58:55Z
"Magnetic Brightening of Carbon Nanotube Photoluminescence through
  Symmetry Breaking","Often a modification of microscopic symmetry in a system can result in a
dramatic change in its macroscopic properties. Here we report that symmetry
breaking by a tube-threading magnetic field can drastically increase the
photoluminescence quantum yield of semiconducting single-walled carbon
nanotubes, by as much as a factor of six, at low temperatures. To explain this
striking connection between seemingly unrelated properties, we have developed a
comprehensive theoretical model based on magnetic-field-dependent
one-dimensional exciton band structure and the interplay of strong Coulomb
interactions and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This conclusively explains our data
as the first experimental observation of dark excitons 5-10 meV below the
bright excitons in single-walled carbon nanotubes. We predict that this quantum
yield increase can be made much larger in disorder-free samples.",2007-02-02T03:55:26Z
"Density functional approach to study structural properties and Electric
  Field Gradients in rare earth materials","We investigated the effect of spin polarization on the structural properties
and gradient of electric field (EFG) on Sn, In, and Cd impurity in RSn$_3$
(R=Sm, Eu, Gd) and RIn$_3$ (R=Tm, Yb, Lu) compounds. The calculations were
performed self-consistently using the scalar-relativistic full potential
linearized augmented plane wave method. The local density approximations (LDA)
and generalized gradient approximation without spin polarization (GGA) and with
spin polarization (GGA+SP) to density functional theory were applied. In
addition to that we performed some calculations within open core treatment
(GGA+open core). It is clearly seen that GGA+SP is successful in predicting the
larger lattice parameter and the dramatic drop of EFG for R=(Eu, Yb) relative
to other rare earth compounds. This is an indication that spin splitting
generated by spin polarization without any modification, is capable of treating
properly the highly correlated f electrons in these systems.",2007-01-23T16:44:04Z
"Switchable coupling for superconducting qubits using double resonance in
  the presence of crosstalk","Several methods have been proposed recently to achieve switchable coupling
between superconducting qubits. We discuss some of the main considerations
regarding the feasibility of implementing one of those proposals: the
double-resonance method. We analyze mainly issues related to the achievable
effective coupling strength and the effects of crosstalk on this coupling
approach. We also find a new, crosstalk-assisted coupling channel that can be
an attractive alternative when implementing the double-resonance coupling
proposal.",2007-02-26T15:42:47Z
"Influence of structural disorder on low-temperature behavior of
  penetration depth in electron-doped high-T_C thin films","To probe the influence of structural disorder on low-temperature behavior of
magnetic penetration depth in electron-doped high-T_C superconductors, a
comparative study of high-quality Pr_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_4 (PCCO) and
Sm_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_4 (SCCO) thin films is presented. The obtained results
confirm a d-wave pairing mechanism in both samples, substantially modified by
impurity scattering (which is more noticeable in less homogeneous SCCO films)
at the lowest temperatures. The value of the extracted impurity scattering rate
correlates with the quality of our samples and is found to be much higher in
less homogeneous films with lower T_C.",2007-01-18T18:40:17Z
"Space-Time-Frequency Degrees of Freedom: Fundamental Limits for Spatial
  Information","We bound the number of electromagnetic signals which may be observed over a
frequency range $[F-W,F+W]$ a time interval $[0,T]$ within a sphere of radius
$R$. We show that the such constrained signals may be represented by a series
expansion whose terms are bounded exponentially to zero beyond a threshold. Our
result implies there is a finite amount of information which may be extracted
from a region of space via electromagnetic radiation.",2007-01-09T00:10:06Z
Quantum versus classical statistical dynamics of an ultracold Bose gas,"We investigate the conditions under which quantum fluctuations are relevant
for the quantitative interpretation of experiments with ultracold Bose gases.
This requires to go beyond the description in terms of the Gross-Pitaevskii and
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field theories, which can be obtained as classical
(statistical) field-theory approximations of the quantum many-body problem. We
employ functional-integral techniques based on the two-particle irreducible
(2PI) effective action. The role of quantum fluctuations is studied within the
nonperturbative 2PI 1/N expansion to next-to-leading order. At this accuracy
level memory-integrals enter the dynamic equations, which differ for quantum
and classical statistical descriptions. This can be used to obtain a
'classicality' condition for the many-body dynamics. We exemplify this
condition by studying the nonequilibrium evolution of a 1D Bose gas of sodium
atoms, and discuss some distinctive properties of quantum versus classical
statistical dynamics.",2007-03-06T19:12:47Z
"Diagrammatic Determinantal methods: projective schemes and applications
  to the Hubbard-Holstein model","We extend the weak-coupling diagrammatic determinantal algorithm to
projective schemes as well as to the inclusion of phonon degrees of freedom.
The projective approach provides a very efficient algorithm to access zero
temperature properties. To implement phonons, we integrate them out in favor of
a retarded density-density interaction and simulate the resulting purely
electronic action with the weak-coupling diagrammatic determinantal algorithm.
Both extensions are tested within the dynamical mean field approximation for
the Hubbard and Hubbard-Holstein models.",2007-02-20T09:41:29Z
"Quantization of perturbations during inflation in the 1+3 covariant

Two-Species Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process with Open Boundaries,"We study the steady state of the two-species Asymmetric Simple Exclusion
Process (ASEP) with open boundary conditions. The matrix product method works
for the determination of the stationary probability distribution. Several
physical quantities are calculated through an explicit representation for the
matrix products. By making full use of the relation with the continuous big
q-Hermite polynomials, we arrive at integral formulae for the partition
function and the n-point functions. We examine the thermodynamic limit and find
three phases: the low-density phase, the high-density phase and the maximal
current phase.",2007-03-26T17:48:03Z
"Proper Motions of the Jets in the Region of HH 30 and HL/XZ Tau.
  Evidence for a Binary Exciting Source of the HH 30 Jet","We present [SII] images of the HH 30 and HL/XZ Tau region obtained at two
epochs, as well as long-slit optical spectroscopy of the HH 30 jet. We measured
proper motions of about 100-300 km/s for the HH 30 jet and counterjet, and of
about 120 km/s for the HL Tau jet. Inclination angles with respect to the plane
of the sky are 0-40 deg for the HH 30 jet and 60 deg for the HL Tau jet.
Comparison with previous observations suggests that most of the jet knots
consist of persisting structures. Also, we corroborate that the HH 30-N knots
correspond to the head of the HH 30 jet. The overall HH 30 jet structure can be
well described by a wiggling ballistic jet, arising either by the orbital
motion of the jet source around a primary or by precession of the jet axis
because of the tidal effects of a companion. In the first scenario, the orbital
period would be 53 yr and the total mass 0.25-2 solar masses. In the precession
scenario, the mass of the jet source would be 0.1-1 solar masses, the orbital
period <1 yr, and the mass of the companion less than a few times 0.01 solar
masses, thus being a substellar object or a giant exoplanet. In both scenarios
a binary system with a separation <18 AU (<0.13 arcsec) is required. Since the
radius of the flared disk observed with the HST is about 250 AU, we conclude
that this disk appears to be circumbinary rather than circumstellar, suggesting
that the search for the collimating agent of the HH 30 jet should be carried
out at much smaller scales.",2007-03-07T19:12:40Z
"Crystal truncation rods in kinematical and dynamical x-ray diffraction
  theories","Crystal truncation rods calculated in the kinematical approximation are shown
to quantitatively agree with the sum of the diffracted waves obtained in the
two-beam dynamical calculations for different reflections along the rod. The
choice and the number of these reflections are specified. The agreement extends
down to at least $\sim 10^{-7}$ of the peak intensity. For lower intensities,
the accuracy of dynamical calculations is limited by truncation of the electron
density at a mathematically planar surface, arising from the Fourier series
expansion of the crystal polarizability.",2007-02-28T13:01:17Z
Inhomogeneity-induced enhancement of the pairing interaction in cuprates,"Scanning tunneling spectroscopy has recently discovered a positive
correlation between the magnitude of the superconducting gap and positions of
dopant oxygen atoms in Bi-based cuprates. We propose a microscopic mechanism
that could be responsible for this effect. In particular, we demonstrate that
the dopant-induced spatial variation of the atomic levels always enhances the
superexchange interaction.",2007-03-22T00:35:38Z
Searching for the reionization sources,"Using a reionization model simultaneously accounting for a number of
experimental data sets, we investigate the nature and properties of
reionization sources. Such model predicts that hydrogen reionization starts at
z \approx 15, is initially driven by metal-free (PopIII) stars, and is 90%
complete by z \approx 8. We find that a fraction f_\gamma >80% of the ionizing
power at z > 7 comes from haloes of mass M<10^9 M_sun predominantly harbouring
PopIII stars; a turnover to a PopII-dominated phase occurs shortly after, with
this population, residing in M>10^9 M_sun haloes, yielding f_\gamma \approx 60%
at z=6. Using Lyman-break broadband dropout techniques, J-band detection of
sources contributing to 50% (90%) of the ionizing power at z \sim 7.5 requires
to reach a magnitude J_{110,AB} = 31.2 (31.7), where about 15 (30) (PopIII)
sources/arcmin^2 are predicted. We conclude that z>7 sources tentatively
identified in broadband surveys are relatively massive (M \approx 10^9 M_sun)
and rare objects which are only marginally (\approx 1%) adding to the
reionization photon budget.",2007-03-29T20:01:13Z
"Aging in One-Dimensional Coagulation-Diffusion Processes and the
  Fredrickson-Andersen Model","We analyse the aging dynamics of the one-dimensional Fredrickson-Andersen
(FA) model in the nonequilibrium regime following a low temperature quench.
Relaxation then effectively proceeds via diffusion limited pair coagulation
(DLPC) of mobility excitations. By employing a familiar stochastic similarity
transformation, we map exact results from the free fermion case of diffusion
limited pair annihilation to DLPC. Crucially, we are able to adapt the mapping
technique to averages involving multiple time quantities. This relies on
knowledge of the explicit form of the evolution operators involved. Exact
results are obtained for two-time correlation and response functions in the
free fermion DLPC process. The corresponding long-time scaling forms apply to a
wider class of DLPC processes, including the FA model. We are thus able to
exactly characterise the violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
(FDT) in the aging regime of the FA model. We find nontrivial scaling forms for
the fluctuation-dissipation ratio (FDR) X = X(tw/t), but with a negative
asymptotic value X = -3*pi/(6*pi - 16) = -3.307. While this prevents a
thermodynamic interpretation in terms of an effective temperature, it is a
direct consequence of probing FDT with observables that couple to activated
dynamics. The existence of negative FDRs should therefore be a widespread
feature in non mean-field systems.",2007-02-26T21:13:01Z
"Quasi-Classical Calculation of the Mixed-State Thermal Conductivity in
  s-Wave and d-Wave Superconductors","To see how superconducting gap structures affect the longitudinal component
of mixed-state thermal conductivity kappa_{xx}(B), the magnetic-field
dependences of kappa_{xx}(B) in s-wave and d-wave superconductors are
investigated. Calculations are performed on the basis of the quasi-classical
theory of superconductivity by fully taking account of the spatial variation of
the normal Green's function, neglected in previous works, by the
Brandt-Pesch-Tewordt approximation. On the basis of our result, we discuss the
possibility of kappa_{xx}(B) measurement as a method of probing the gap
structure.",2007-02-06T08:21:33Z
Dynamical modeling of the Deep Impact dust ejecta cloud,"The collision of Deep Impact with comet 9P/Tempel 1 generated a bright cloud
of dust which dissipated during several days after the impact. The brightness
variations of this cloud and the changes of its position and shape are governed
by the physical properties of the dust grains. We use a Monte Carlo model to
describe the evolution of the post-impact dust plume. The results of our
dynamical simulations are compared to the data obtained with FORS2, the FOcal
Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph for the VLT of the European Southern
Observatory (ESO), to derive the particle size distribution and the total
amount of material contained in the dust ejecta cloud.",2007-03-21T13:00:20Z
"Solvation of positive ions in water: The dominant role of water-water
  interaction","Local polarization effects, induced by mono and divalent positive ions in
water, influence (and in turn are influenced by) the large scale structural
properties of the solvent. Experiments can only distinguish this process of
interplay in a generic qualitative way. Instead, first principles quantum
calculations can address the question at both electronic and atomistic scale,
accounting for electronic polarization as well as geometrical conformations.
For this reason we study the extension of the scales' interconnection by means
of first principle Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics applied to systems of
different size. In this way we identify the general aspects dominating the
physics of the first solvation shell and their connection to the effects
related to the formation of the outer shells and eventually the bulk. We show
that while the influence of the ions is extended to the first shell only, the
water-water interaction is instead playing a dominant role even within the
first shell independently from the size or the charge of the ion.",2007-02-09T17:21:13Z
"The structures and thermoelectric properties of the infinitely adaptive
  series (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n","The structures and thermoelectric properties of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n
homologous series, derived from stacking hexagonal Bi2 and Bi2Te3 blocks, are
reported. The end-members of this series are metallic Bi and semiconducting
Bi2Te3; nine members of the series have been studied. The structures form an
infinitely adaptive series and a unified structural description based on a
modulated structure approach is presented. The as-synthesized samples have
thermopowers (S) that vary from n-type for Bi2Te3 to p-type for phases rich in
Bi2 blocks but with some Bi2Te3 blocks present, to n-type again for Bi metal.
The thermoelectric power factor (S2/rho) is highest for Bi metal (43 muW/K2 cm
at 130 K), followed by Bi2Te3 (20 muW/K2 cm at 270 K), while Bi2Te (m:n = 5:2)
and Bi7Te3 (m:n = 15:6) have 9 muW/K2 cm (at 240 K) and 11 muW/K2 (at 270 K),
respectively. The results of doping studies with Sb and Se into Bi2Te are
reported.",2007-03-20T18:17:21Z
"Signatures of Many-Particle Correlations in Two-Dimensional
  Fourier-Transform Spectra of Semiconductor Nanostructures","On the basis of a microscopic theory, the signatures of many-particle
correlations in Two-Dimensional Fourier-Transform Spectra (2D-FTS) of

Graphene-based resonant-tunneling strucures,"Resonant electronic transmission through graphene-based double barriers
(wells) is studied as a function of the incident wave vector, the widths and

Zero modes and the edge states of the honeycomb lattice,"The honeycomb lattice in the cylinder geometry with zigzag edges, bearded
edges, zigzag and bearded edges (zigzag-bearded), and armchair edges are
studied. The tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hoppings is used. Edge
states are obtained analytically for these edges except the armchair edges. It
is shown, however, that edge states for the armchair edges exist when the the
system is anisotropic. These states have not been known previously. We also
find strictly localized states, uniformly extended states and states with
macroscopic degeneracy.",2007-02-07T02:34:26Z
Transition-metal dimers and physical limits on magnetic anisotropy,"Recent advances in nanoscience have raised interest in the minimum bit size
required for classical information storage, i.e. for bistability with
suppressed quantum tunnelling and energy barriers that exceed ambient
temperatures. In the case of magnetic information storage much attention has
centred on molecular magnets[1] with bits consisting of ~ 100 atoms, magnetic
uniaxial anisotropy energy barriers ~ 50 K, and very slow relaxation at low
temperatures. In this article we draw attention to the remarkable magnetic
properties of some transition metal dimers which have energy barriers
approaching ~ 500 K with only two atoms. The spin dynamics of these ultra small
nanomagnets is strongly affected by a Berry phase which arises from
quasi-degeneracies at the electronic Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO)
energy. In a giant spin-approximation, this Berry phase makes the effective
reversal barrier thicker. [1] Gatteschi, D., Sessoli, R. & Villain, J.

Mechanical limits of viral capsids,"We study the elastic properties and mechanical stability of viral capsids
under external force-loading with computer simulations. Our approach allows the
implementation of specific geometries corresponding to specific phages such as
$\phi$29 and CCMV. We demonstrate how in a combined numerical and experimental
approach the elastic parameters can be determined with high precision. The
experimentally observed bimodality of elastic spring constants is shown to be
of geometrical origin, namely the presence of pentavalent units in the viral
shell. A criterion for capsid breakage is defined, which explains well the
experimentally observed rupture. From our numerics we find for the dependence
of the rupture force on the F\""oppl-von K\'arm\'an (FvK) number a crossover
from $\gamma^{2/3}$ to $\gamma^{1/2}$. For filled capsids high internal
pressures lead to a stronger destabilization of viruses with a buckled ground
state than unbuckled ones. Finally, we show how our numerically calculated
energy maps can be used to extract information about the strength of
protein-protein interactions from rupture experiments.",2007-03-14T13:14:03Z
"Theory of electron-phonon interaction in a nonequilibrium open
  electronic system","We study the effects of time-independent nonequilibrium drive on an open 2D
electron gas system coupled to 2D longitudinal acoustic phonons using the
Keldysh path integral method. The layer electron-phonon system is defined at
the two-dimensional interface between a pair of three-dimensional Fermi liquid
leads, which act both as a particle pump and an infinite bath. The
nonequilibrium steady state is achieved in the layer by assuming the leads to
be thermally equilibrated at two different chemical potentials. This subjects
the layer to an out-of-plane voltage $V$ and drives a steady-state charge
current perpendicular to the system. We compute the effects of small voltages
($V\ll\w_D$) on the in-plane electron-phonon scattering rate and the electron
effective mass at zero temperature. We also find that the obtained
onequilibrium modification to the acoustic phonon velocity and the Thomas-Fermi
screening length reveal the possibility of tuning these quantities with the
external voltage.",2007-03-08T21:00:58Z
Efficient DMFT-simulation of the Holstein-Hubbard Model,"We present a method for solving impurity models with electron-phonon
coupling, which treats the phonons efficiently and without approximations. The
algorithm is applied to the Holstein-Hubbard model in the dynamical mean field
approximation, where it allows access to strong interactions, very low
temperatures and arbitrary fillings. We show that a renormalized
Migdal-Eliashberg theory provides a reasonlable description of the phonon
contribution to the electronic self energy in strongly doped systems, but fails
if the quasiparticle energy becomes of order of the phonon frequency.",2007-01-30T15:40:02Z
"Evolution of the magnetic anisotropy with carrier density in
  hydrogenated (Ga,Mn)As","The magnetic properties of (Ga,Mn)As thin films depend on both the Mn doping
level and the carrier concentration. Using a post growth hydrogenation process
we show that it is possible to decrease the hole density from 1.1021 cm-3 to
<1017 cm-3 while maintaining the manganese concentration constant. For such a
series of films we have investigated the variation of the magnetization, the
easy and hard axes of magnetization, the critical temperatures, the coercive
fields and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants as a function of
temperature using magnetometry, ferromagnetic resonance and magneto-transport
measurements. In particular, we evidenced that magnetic easy axes flipped from
out-of-plane [001] to in-plane [100] axis, followed by the <110> axes, with
increasing hole density and temperature. Our study concluded on a general
agreement with mean-field theory predictions of the expected easy axis
reversals, and of the weight of uniaxial and cubic anisotropies in this
material.",2007-02-23T14:06:56Z
"An electrostatically defined serial triple quantum dot charged with few

heterostructure is characterized by using a nearby quantum point contact as
charge detector. Ground state stability diagrams demonstrate control in the
regime of few electrons charging the TQD. An electrostatic model is developed
to determine the ground state charge configurations of the TQD. Numerical
calculations are compared with experimental results. In addition, the tunneling
conductance through all three quantum dots in series is studied. Quantum
cellular automata processes are identified, which are where charge
reconfiguration between two dots occurs in response to the addition of an
electron in the third dot.",2007-03-16T19:36:24Z
Thermodynamics of a Trapped Unitary Fermi Gas,"We present the first model-independent comparison of recent measurements of

temperature in a cold fermionic atomic cloud is consistent with a value
$T_c=0.23(2)epsilon_F$ in the bulk, as predicted by the present authors in
their Monte Carlo calculations.",2007-01-31T20:36:49Z
"Rest-Frame R-band Lightcurve of a z~1.3 Supernova Obtained with Keck
  Laser Adaptive Optics","We present Keck diffraction limited H-band photometry of a z~1.3 Type Ia
supernova (SN) candidate, first identified in a Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
search for SNe in massive high redshift galaxy clusters. The adaptive optics
(AO) data were obtained with the Laser Guide Star facility during four
observing runs from September to November 2005. In the analysis of data from
the observing run nearest to maximum SN brightness, the SN was found to have a
magnitude H=23.9 +/- 0.14 (Vega). We present the H-band (approximately
rest-frame R) light curve and provide a detailed analysis of the AO photometric
uncertainties. By constraining the aperture correction with a nearby (4""
separation) star we achieve 0.14 magnitude photometric precision, despite the
spatially varying AO PSF.",2007-03-15T00:15:48Z
"Merging of single-particle levels and non-Fermi-liquid behavior of
  finite Fermi systems","We examine the problem of finite Fermi systems having a degenerate
single-particle spectrum and show that the Landau approach, applied to such a
system, admits the possibility of merging single-particle levels. It is
demonstrated that the opportunity for this behavior is widespread in quantum
many-body systems. The salient feature of the phenomenon is the occurrence of
nonintegral quasiparticle occupation numbers, leading to a radical alteration
of the standard quasiparticle picture. Implications of this alteration are
considered for nuclear, atomic, and solid-state systems.",2007-01-05T19:55:11Z
Elementary Electronic Excitations in Graphene Nanoribbons,"We analyze the collective mode spectrum of graphene nanoribbons within the
random phase approximation. In the undoped case, only metallic armchair
nanoribbons support a propagating plasmon mode. Landau damping of this mode is
shown to be suppressed through the chirality of the single particle
wavefunctions. We argue that undoped zigzag nanoribbons should not support
plasmon excitations because of a broad continuum of particle-hole excitations
associated with surface states, into which collective modes may decay. Doped
nanoribbons have properties similar to those of semiconductor nanowires,
including a plasmon mode dispersing as $q\sqrt{-\ln qW}$ and a static
dielectric response that is divergent at $q=2k_F$.",2007-01-31T18:52:06Z
Very metal poor Classical Cepheids: variables in IZw18,"In the framework of an ongoing ACS@HST project (HST program #10586, PI:
Aloisi) we have obtained deep multi-color imaging of the very metal-poor Blue
Compact Dwarf galaxy IZw18. The data were acquired in time-series fashion to
allow the identification of Classical Cepheids (CCs). The main aim of this
project is to constrain both the distance and the Star Formation History of the
galaxy. However, as a byproduct these data also provide new insights into the
properties of CCs at very low metallicities. We have identified 24 candidate
CCs in IZw18. New theoretical pulsation models of CCs specifically for the low
metallicity of this primordial galaxy (Z=0.0004, Y=0.24) have been computed to
interpret our results.",2007-03-27T11:41:31Z
"Nonextensibility of internal energy in incomplete statistics and the
  zeroth law of thermodynamics","On the basis of the entropy of incomplete statistics (IS) and the joint
probability factorization condition, two controversial problems existing in IS
are investigated, where one is what the correct expression of the internal
energy for a composite system is and the other is whether the zeroth law of
thermodynamics is true or not. Some new equivalent expressions of the internal
energy of a composite system are derived through a precise mathematical
calculation. Moreover, a self-consistent calculation is used to expound that
the zeroth law of thermodynamics is also suitable for IS, but it can't be
proven from theory. Finally, it is pointed out that the generalized zeroth law
of thermodynamics and the expressions of the internal energy of a composite
system derived in literature are incorrect, because two irrational assumptions
have been implicitly introduced.",2007-02-02T07:06:34Z
"Three-particle collisions in quantum wires: Corrections to thermopower
  and conductance","We consider the effect of electron-electron interaction on the electron
transport through a finite length single-mode quantum wire with reflectionless
contacts. The two-particle scattering events cannot alter the electric current
and therefore we study the effect of three-particle collisions. Within the
Boltzmann equation framework, we calculate corrections to the thermopower and
conductance to the leading order in the interaction and in the length of wire
$L$. We check explicitly that the three-particle collision rate is identically
zero in the case of several integrable interaction potentials. In the general
(non-integrable) case, we find a positive contribution to the thermopower to
leading order in $L$. The processes giving rise to the correction involve
electron states deep in the Fermi sea. Therefore the correction follows an
activation law with the characteristic energy of the order of the Fermi energy
for the electrons in the wire.",2007-03-01T22:17:58Z
Spin Angular Momentum Imparted by Gravitational Waves,"Following the demonstration that gravitational waves impart linear momentum,
it is argued that if they are polarized they should impart angular momentum to
appropriately placed 'test rods' in their path. A general formula for this

momentum imparted by plane and cylindrical gravitational waves.",2007-01-23T10:39:36Z
Vortex density spectrum of quantum turbulence,"The fluctuations of the vortex density in a turbulent quantum fluid are
deduced from local second-sound attenuation measurements. These measurements
are performed with a micromachined open-cavity resonator inserted across a flow
of turbulent He-II near 1.6 K. The power spectrum of the measured vortex line
density is compatible with a (-5/3) power law. The physical interpretation,
still open, is discussed.",2007-01-08T07:43:42Z
Large Deviations of the Maximum Eigenvalue in Wishart Random Matrices,"We compute analytically the probability of large fluctuations to the left of
the mean of the largest eigenvalue in the Wishart (Laguerre) ensemble of
positive definite random matrices. We show that the probability that all the
eigenvalues of a (N x N) Wishart matrix W=X^T X (where X is a rectangular M x N
matrix with independent Gaussian entries) are smaller than the mean value
<\lambda>=N/c decreases for large N as $\sim \exp[-\frac{\beta}{2}N^2
\Phi_{-}(\frac{2}{\sqrt{c}}+1;c)]$, where \beta=1,2 correspond respectively to
real and complex Wishart matrices, c=N/M < 1 and \Phi_{-}(x;c) is a large
deviation function that we compute explicitly. The result for the Anti-Wishart
case (M < N) simply follows by exchanging M and N. We also analytically
determine the average spectral density of an ensemble of constrained Wishart
matrices whose eigenvalues are forced to be smaller than a fixed barrier. The
numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with the analytical
predictions.",2007-01-16T11:05:06Z
"Replica Symmetry Breaking Condition Exposed by Random Matrix Calculation
  of Landscape Complexity","We start with a rather detailed, general discussion of recent results of the
replica approach to statistical mechanics of a single classical particle placed
in a random $N (\gg 1)$-dimensional Gaussian landscape and confined by a
spherically symmetric potential suitably growing at infinity. Then we employ
random matrix methods to calculate the density of stationary points, as well as
minima, of the associated energy surface. This is used to show that for a
generic smooth, concave confining potentials the condition of the
zero-temperature replica symmetry breaking coincides with one signalling that
{\it both} mean total number of stationary points in the energy landscape, {\it
and} the mean number of minima are exponential in $N$. For such systems the
(annealed) complexity of minima vanishes cubically when approaching the
critical confinement, whereas the cumulative annealed complexity vanishes
quadratically. Different behaviour reported in our earlier short communication
[Y.V. Fyodorov et al., {\it JETP Lett.} {\bf 85}, 261, (2007)] was due to
non-analyticity of the hard-wall confinement potential. Finally, for the
simplest case of parabolic confinement we investigate how the complexity
depends on the index of stationary points. In particular, we show that in the
vicinity of critical confinement the saddle-points with a positive annealed
complexity must be close to minima, as they must have a vanishing {\it
fraction} of negative eigenvalues in the Hessian.",2007-02-26T15:05:10Z
"Representing molecule-surface interactions with symmetry-adapted neural
  networks","The accurate description of molecule-surface interactions requires a detailed
knowledge of the underlying potential-energy surface (PES). Recently, neural
networks (NNs) have been shown to be an efficient technique to accurately
interpolate the PES information provided for a set of molecular configurations,
e.g. by first-principles calculations. Here, we further develop this approach
by building the NN on a new type of symmetry functions, which allows to take
the symmetry of the surface exactly into account. The accuracy and efficiency
of such symmetry-adapted NNs is illustrated by the application to a
six-dimensional PES describing the interaction of oxygen molecules with the
Al(111) surface.",2007-02-22T12:55:05Z
"A high pressure calorimetric experiment to validate the liquid-liquid
  critical point hypothesis in water","An experimental proposal to test the existence of a liquid-liquid critical
point in water, based on high pressure calorimetric measurements, is presented
on this paper. Considering the existence of an intramolecular correlation in
the water molecule we show how the response of the specific heat at high
pressure is different depending on the existence, or not, of the second
critical point. If the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis is true there
must be a maximum in the specific heat at some temperature $T>T_{H}$ for any
pressure $P>P_{c}$ (being $T_{H}$ the homogeneous nucleation temperature and
$P_{c}$ the pressure of the second critical point). This maximum does not
appear for the singularity free scenario.",2007-01-23T14:21:11Z
"Optical properties of \textit{n}- and \textit{p}-type ZnO thin films --
  two different approaches to the impurity distribution inhomogeneity","We investigated the optical properties of epitaxial \textit{n}- and
\textit{p}-type ZnO films grown on lattice-matched ScAlMgO$_4$ substrates.
Chemical doping yielded a severe inhomogeneity in a statistical distribution of
involved charged impurities. Two approaches are adopted to treat the
inhomogeneity effects; Monte Carlo simulation technique for the
\textit{n}-doped films, and the fluctuation theory for the \textit{p}-ZnO. The
broadening of PL band of \textit{n}-ZnO was significantly larger than predicted
by theoretical results in which the linewidths of each individual emissions
have been determined mainly from the concentration fluctuation of donor-type
dopants by the simulation. Moreover, the rather asymmetrical line shape was
observed. To explain these features, a vibronic model was developed accounting
for contributions from a series of phonon replicas. In case of \textit{p}-type
ZnO:N, analysis of excitation-intensity dependence of the peak shift of
donor-acceptor luminescence with a fluctuation model has also proven the
importance of the inhomogeneity effect of charged impurity distribution, as in
the case of ZnO:Ga. We extracted the inhomogeneity in the sample and acceptor
activation energy prepared under the various growth conditions. It is shown
that the theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental 5-K
time-resolved luminescence for the systems in a fluctuation field. Finally,
localized-state distributions have been studied in N-doped ZnO thin films by
means of transient photocurrent measurement.",2007-01-31T07:17:49Z
Complex permittivity of a biased superlattice,"Intersubband response in a superlattice subjected to a homogeneous electric
field (biased superlattice with equipopulated levels) is studied within the
tight-binding approximation, taking into account the interplay between
homogeneous and inhomogeneous mechanisms of broadening. The complex dielectric
permittivity is calculated beyond the Born approximation for a wide spectral
region. A detectable gain below the resonance is obtained for the low-doped
$GaAs$-based biased superlattice in the THz spectral region. Conditions of the
stimulated emission regime for metallic and dielectric waveguide structures are
discussed.",2007-01-21T11:13:41Z
"A novel set of rotationally and translationally invariant features for
  images based on the non-commutative bispectrum","We propose a new set of rotationally and translationally invariant features
for image or pattern recognition and classification. The new features are cubic
polynomials in the pixel intensities and provide a richer representation of the
original image than most existing systems of invariants. Our construction is
based on the generalization of the concept of bispectrum to the
three-dimensional rotation group SO(3), and a projection of the image onto the
sphere.",2007-01-20T15:45:03Z
"Multicritical behavior of two-dimensional anisotropic antiferromagnets
  in a magnetic field","We study the phase diagram and multicritical behavior of anisotropic
Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a square lattice in the presence of a magnetic
field along the easy axis. We argue that, beside the Ising and XY critical
lines, the phase diagram presents a first-order spin-flop line starting from
T=0, as in the three-dimensional case. By using field theory we show that the
multicritical point where these transition lines meet cannot be O(3) symmetric
and occurs at finite temperature. We also predict how the critical temperature
of the transition lines varies with the magnetic field and the uniaxial
anisotropy in the limit of weak anisotropy.",2007-02-12T09:36:05Z
Entanglement and the Kondo effect in double quantum dots,"We investigate entanglement between electrons in serially coupled double
quantum dots attached to non interacting leads. In addition to local repulsion
we consider the influence of capacitive inter-dot interaction. We show how the

ground state and thereby the entanglement.",2007-01-16T15:08:51Z
"Gravitational instability of discs with dissipative corona around
  supermassive black holes","We study the dynamical structure of a self-gravitating disc with corona
around a super-massive black hole. Assuming that the
magneto-rotational-instability (MRI) responsible for generating the turbulent
stresses inside the disc is also the source for a magnetically dominated
corona, a fraction of the power released when the disc matter accretes is
transported to and dissipated in the corona. This has major effect on the
structure of the disc and its gravitational (in)stability according to our
analytical and self-consistent solutions. We determine the radius where the
disc crosses the inner radius of gravitational instability and forms the first
stars. Not only the location of this radius which may extend to very large
distances from the central black hole, but also the mass of the first stars
highly depends on the input parameters, notably the viscous coefficient, mass
of the central object and the accretion rate. For accretion discs around
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and the Galactic center, we determine the
self-gravitating radius and the mass of the first clumps. Comparing the cases
with a corona and without a corona for typical discs around QSOs or the
Galactic center, when the viscosity coefficient is around 0.3, we show that the
self-gravitating radius decreases by a factor of approximately 2, but the mass
of the fragments increases with more or less the same factor. Existence of a
corona implies a more gravitationally unstable disc according to our results.
The effect of a corona on the instability of the disc is more effective when
the viscosity coefficient increases.",2007-03-12T16:41:18Z
"Tuning Hole Mobility, Concentration, and Repulsion in High-$T_c$
  Cuprates via Apical Atoms","Using a newly developed first-principles Wannier-states approach that takes
into account large on-site Coulomb repulsion, we derive the effective
low-energy interacting Hamiltonians for several prototypical high-$T_c$
superconducting cuprates. The material dependence is found to originate
primarily from the different energy of the apical atom $p_z$ state.
Specifically, the general properties of the low-energy hole state, namely the
Zhang-Rice singlet, are significantly modified by a triplet state associated
with this $p_z$ state, via additional intra-sublattice hoppings,
nearest-neighbor ""super-repulsion"", and other microscopic many-body processes.
Possible implications on modulation of $T_c$, local superconducting gaps,
charge distribution, hole mobility, electron-phonon interaction, and
multi-layer effects are discussed.",2007-02-20T17:09:13Z
"Recruitment, Preparation, Retention: A case study of computing culture
  at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","Computer science is seeing a decline in enrollment at all levels of
education, including undergraduate and graduate study. This paper reports on
the results of a study conducted at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign which evaluated students attitudes regarding three areas which
can contribute to improved enrollment in the Department of Computer Science:
Recruitment, preparation and retention. The results of our study saw two
themes. First, the department's tight research focus appears to draw
significant attention from other activities -- such as teaching, service, and
other community-building activities -- that are necessary for a department's
excellence. Yet, as demonstrated by our second theme, one partial solution is
to better promote such activities already employed by the department to its
students and faculty. Based on our results, we make recommendations for
improvements and enhancements based on the current state of practice at peer
institutions.",2007-02-24T00:34:10Z
"Critical Scattering and Dynamical Scaling in an Heisenberg Ferromagnet
  Neutron Spin Echo versus Renormalization Group Theory","High resolution Neutron Spin Echo (NSE) spectroscopy was used to investigate
the dynamics of an 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet in the exchange-controlled regime
over a broad range of temperatures and momentum transfer. These results allow
for the first time an extensive comparison between the experimental dynamical
critical behavior and the predictions of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory.
The agreement is exhaustive and surprising as the RG theory accounts not only
for the critical relaxation but also for the shape crossover towards an
exponential diffusive relaxation when moving from the critical to the
hydrodynamic regime above $T_C$.",2007-03-27T09:15:31Z
"Thermoelectric phenomena in a quantum dot asymmetrically coupled to
  external leads","We study thermoelectric phenomena in a system consisting of strongly
correlated quantum dot coupled to external leads in the Kondo regime. We
calculate linear and nonlinear electrical and thermal conductance and
thermopower of the quantum dot and discuss the role of asymmetry in the
couplings to external electrodes. In the linear regime electrical and thermal
conductances are modified, while thermopower remains unchanged. In the
nonlinear regime the Kondo resonance in differential conductance develops at
non-zero source-drain voltage, which has important consequences on
thermoelectric properties of the system and the thermopower starts to depend on
the asymmetry. We also discuss Wiedemann-Franz relation, thermoelectric figure
of merit and validity of the Mott formula for thermopower.",2007-03-16T18:22:07Z
"Field galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.2 < z < 0.8) in the direction
  of the galaxy cluster LCDCS-S001","We present spectroscopic and photometric analysis for eight field galaxies in
the direction of the galaxy cluster LCDCS-S001. The spectra were obtained with
the GMOS instrument in the Gemini South Observatory. The objects were selected
in an i' band image and the multi-object spectroscopic observations were
centered at 7500 A. For the galaxies ID 440 and ID 461 we have determined
redshifts of z=0.7464 and z=0.7465, respectively. For the other six galaxies we
have confirmed the redshift calculated by Rembold & Pastoriza (2006). The
redshifts of the field galaxies are in the range of 0.2201 < z < 0.7784. We
determined the blue and visual luminosities and they are brighter than
M_B=-18.64. The galaxies ID 180, ID 266, ID 461 follow the Faber-Jackson
relation of the Coma and Virgo early-type galaxies, and therefore do not
present a brightening of the B luminosity as observed in galaxies at higher
redshifts. The stellar velocity dispersion was measured for five galaxies and
estimated to be in the range of 200 < sigma < 346 km/s. Lick indices were
measured and used to determine the stellar population properties of galaxies ID
120 and ID 146, by means of spectral synthesis. The first galaxy, ID 120,
presents in its spectrum absorption and emission lines, and we have found that
the main contribution in the flux at lambda 5870 A is of a 0.1 Gyr stellar
population of solar metallicity. For ID 146, the dominant flux contribution at
lambda 4200 A, is provided by a stellar population of 10 Gyr of subsolar
metallicity. From stellar population synthesis we estimated reddening values of
E(B-V)=0.90 and E(B-V)=0.82 for ID 120 and ID 146, respectively. According to
classical diagnostic diagrams the emission lines present in the spectrum of ID
120 indicate that it is a starburst galaxy.",2007-03-30T16:37:14Z
"Freezing effects in the two dimensional one-component plasma and in thin
  film type II superconductors","We present results of Monte Carlo simulations of the two dimensional
one-component plasma and of the Ginzberg-Landau model in the lowest Landau
level approximation, with both charges and vortices respectively confined
within a disc. In both models we see that as the temperature is reduced,
oscillations in the radial density develop which spread into the bulk from the
edge of the disc. The amplitude of these oscillations grows as the temperature
is lowered and the length scale over which the oscillations occurs is the same
as the correlation length for local crystalline order at that temperature. At
temperatures similar to those where earlier studies have reported a first-order
fluid-crystal phase transition, the correlation length is comparable to the
linear dimensions of the samples studied, which suggests that finite size
effects will be affecting the accuracy of their conclusions.",2007-02-12T16:53:58Z
"Determination of the infrared complex magneto-conductivity tensor in
  itinerant ferromagnets from Faraday and Kerr measurements","We present measurement and analysis techniques that allow the complete
complex magneto-conductivity tensor to be determined from mid-infrared (11-1.6
micron; 100-800 meV) measurements of the complex Faraday (theta_F) and Kerr
(theta_K) angles. Since this approach involves measurement of the geometry
(orientation axis and ellipticity of the polarization) of transmitted and
reflected light, no absolute transmittance or reflectance measurements are
required. Thick film transmission and reflection equations are used to convert
the complex theta_F and theta_K into the complex longitudinal conductivity
sigma_xx and the complex transverse (Hall) conductivity sigma_xy. theta_F and
theta_K are measured in a Ga_(1-x)Mn_xAs and SrRuO_3 films. The resulting
sigma_xx is compared to the values obtained from conventional transmittance and
reflectance measurements, as well as the results from Kramers-Kronig analysis
of reflectance measurements on similar films.",2007-01-09T17:42:41Z
"On the response of a system with bound states of particles to the
  perturbation by the external electromagnetic field","The response of the system, consisting of two kinds of opposite-charged
fermions and their bound states (hydrogen-like atoms), to the perturbation by
the external electromagnetic field in low particle kinetic energies region is
studied. Expressions for Green functions that describe the system response to
the external electromagnetic field and take into account the presence of
particle bound states (atoms) are found. Macroscopic parameters of the system,
such as conductivity, permittivity and magnetic permeability in terms of these
Green functions are introduced. As an example, the perturbation of the ideal
hydrogen-like plasma by the external electromagnetic field in low temperature
region is considered. Such approach also enables to study the propagation
properties of the signal, tuned up to the transition between two hyperfine
ground state levels of alkali atoms that are considered in Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) state. It is shown that the signal can propagate in such
system with rather small energy loss. Such fact allows to introduce the group
velocity concept and to study the slowing down conditions for the microwave
signal that propagates in BEC.",2007-02-27T10:49:24Z
"An optimal bifactor approximation algorithm for the metric uncapacitated
  facility location problem","We obtain a 1.5-approximation algorithm for the metric uncapacitated facility
location problem (UFL), which improves on the previously best known
1.52-approximation algorithm by Mahdian, Ye and Zhang. Note, that the
approximability lower bound by Guha and Khuller is 1.463.
  An algorithm is a {\em ($\lambda_f$,$\lambda_c$)-approximation algorithm} if
the solution it produces has total cost at most $\lambda_f \cdot F^* +
\lambda_c \cdot C^*$, where $F^*$ and $C^*$ are the facility and the connection
cost of an optimal solution. Our new algorithm, which is a modification of the
$(1+2/e)$-approximation algorithm of Chudak and Shmoys, is a
(1.6774,1.3738)-approximation algorithm for the UFL problem and is the first
one that touches the approximability limit curve $(\gamma_f, 1+2e^{-\gamma_f})$
established by Jain, Mahdian and Saberi. As a consequence, we obtain the first
optimal approximation algorithm for instances dominated by connection costs.
When combined with a (1.11,1.7764)-approximation algorithm proposed by Jain et
al., and later analyzed by Mahdian et al., we obtain the overall approximation
guarantee of 1.5 for the metric UFL problem. We also describe how to use our
algorithm to improve the approximation ratio for the 3-level version of UFL.",2007-03-02T14:49:57Z
A local balance property of episturmian words,"We prove that episturmian words and Arnoux-Rauzy sequences can be
characterized using a local balance property. We also give a new
characterization of epistandard words and show that the set of finite words

"Predictions of Dynamic Behavior Under Pressure for Two Scenarios to
  Explain Water Anomalies","Using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field calculations for a cell model of
water we find a dynamic crossover in the orientational correlation time $\tau$
from non-Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures to Arrhenius behavior at low
temperatures. This dynamic crossover is independent of whether water at very
low temperature is charaterized by a ``liquid-liquid critical point'' or by the
``singularity free'' scenario. We relate $\tau$ to fluctuations of hydrogen
bond network and show that the crossover found for $\tau$ for both scenarios is
a consequence of the sharp change in the average number of hydrogen bonds at
the temperature of the specific heat maximum. We find that the effect of
pressure on the dynamics is strikingly different in the two scenarios, offering
a means to distinguish between them.",2007-02-05T15:57:51Z
"Weakly coupled, antiparallel, totally asymmetric simple exclusion
  processes","We study a system composed of two parallel totally asymmetric simple
exclusion processes with open boundaries, where the particles move in the two
lanes in opposite directions and are allowed to jump to the other lane with
rates inversely proportional to the length of the system. Stationary density
profiles are determined and the phase diagram of the model is constructed in
the hydrodynamic limit, by solving the differential equations describing the
steady state of the system, analytically for vanishing total current and
numerically for nonzero total current. The system possesses phases with a
localized shock in the density profile in one of the lanes, similarly to
exclusion processes endowed with nonconserving kinetics in the bulk. Besides,
the system undergoes a discontinuous phase transition, where coherently moving
delocalized shocks emerge in both lanes and the fluctuation of the global
density is described by an unbiased random walk. This phenomenon is analogous
to the phase coexistence observed at the coexistence line of the totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process, however, as a consequence of the
interaction between lanes, the density profiles are deformed and in the case of
asymmetric lane change, the motion of the shocks is confined to a limited
domain.",2007-03-14T15:26:57Z
Slowly Rotating Homogeneous Stars and the Heun Equation,"The scheme developed by Hartle for describing slowly rotating bodies in 1967
was applied to the simple model of constant density by Chandrasekhar and Miller
in 1974. The pivotal equation one has to solve turns out to be one of Heun's
equations. After a brief discussion of this equation and the chances of finding
a closed form solution, a quickly converging series solution of it is
presented. A comparison with numerical solutions of the full Einstein equations
allows one to truncate the series at an order appropriate to the slow rotation
approximation. The truncated solution is then used to provide explicit
expressions for the metric.",2007-01-15T14:49:05Z
Design parameters for a nano-optical Yagi-Uda antenna,"We investigate the possibility of directing optical emissions using a
Yagi-Uda antenna composed of a finite linear array of nanoparticles. The
relevant parameters characterizing the plasma resonances of the nanoparticles
are identified and the interaction between the array elements is formulated
accordingly. It is shown that the directionality of the optical emission can be
observed even in the presence of non-negligible absorption losses in the
nanoparticles. We conclude that a finite array of gold nanorods may be
sufficient for the realization of a working nano-optical Yagi-Uda antenna.",2007-03-23T01:11:20Z
Time and the Prisoner's Dilemma,"This paper examines the integration of computational complexity into game
theoretic models. The example focused on is the Prisoner's Dilemma, repeated
for a finite length of time. We show that a minimal bound on the players'
computational ability is sufficient to enable cooperative behavior.
  In addition, a variant of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game is suggested,
in which players have the choice of opting out. This modification enriches the
game and suggests dominance of cooperative strategies.
  Competitive analysis is suggested as a tool for investigating sub-optimal
(but computationally tractable) strategies and game theoretic models in
general. Using competitive analysis, it is shown that for bounded players, a
sub-optimal strategy might be the optimal choice, given resource limitations.",2007-01-22T15:23:49Z
"Many-body effects in transport through open systems: pinning of resonant
  levels","The role of electron-electron interaction in transport properties of open
quantum dots is studied. The self-consistent full quantum mechanical
magnetotransport calculations within the Hartree, Density Functional Theory and
Thomas-Fermi approximations were performed where a whole device, including the
semi-infinitive leads, is treated on the same footing (i.e. the
electron-electron interaction is accounted for both in the leads as well as in
the dot region). The main finding of the present paper is the effect of pinning
of the resonant levels to the Fermi energy due to the enhanced screening. Our
results represent a significant departure from a conventional picture where a
variation of external parameters (such as a gate voltage, magnetic field, etc.)
causes the successive dot states to sweep past the Fermi level in a linear
fashion. We instead demonstrate highly nonlinear behavior of the resonant
levels in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The pinning of the resonant levels
in open quantum dots leads to the broadening of the conduction oscillations in
comparison to the one electron picture. The effect of pinning becomes much more
pronounced in the presence of the perpendicular magnetic field. This can be
attributed to the enhanced screening efficiency because of the increased
localization of the wave function. The strong pinning of the resonant energy
levels in the presence of magnetic field can have a profound effect on
transport properties of various devices operating in the edge state transport
regime. We also critically examine an approximation often used in transport
calculations where an inherently open system is replaced by a corresponding
closed one.",2007-01-05T13:32:04Z
Shiva diagrams for composite-boson many-body effects : How they work,"The purpose of this paper is to show how the diagrammatic expansion in
fermion exchanges of scalar products of $N$-composite-boson (``coboson'')
states can be obtained in a practical way. The hard algebra on which this
expansion is based, will be given in an independent publication.
  Due to the composite nature of the particles, the scalar products of
$N$-coboson states do not reduce to a set of Kronecker symbols, as for
elementary bosons, but contain subtle exchange terms between two or more
cobosons. These terms originate from Pauli exclusion between the fermionic
components of the particles. While our many-body theory for composite bosons
leads to write these scalar products as complicated sums of products of ``Pauli
scatterings'' between \emph{two} cobosons, they in fact correspond to fermion
exchanges between any number P of quantum particles, with $2 \leq P\leq N$.
These $P$-body exchanges are nicely represented by the so-called ``Shiva
diagrams'', which are topologically different from Feynman diagrams, due to the
intrinsic many-body nature of Pauli exclusion from which they originate. These
Shiva diagrams in fact constitute the novel part of our composite-exciton
many-body theory which was up to now missing to get its full diagrammatic
representation. Using them, we can now ``see'' through diagrams the physics of
any quantity in which enters $N$ interacting excitons -- or more generally $N$
composite bosons --, with fermion exchanges included in an \emph{exact} -- and
transparent -- way.",2007-01-30T16:22:22Z
Bose-Einstein Condensate in Solid Helium,"We present neutron scattering measurements of the atomic momentum
distribution, n(k), in solid helium under a pressure p = 41 bars and at
temperatures between 80 mK and 500 mK. The aim is to determine whether there is
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) below the critical temperature, T_c = 200 mK
where a superfluid density has been observed. Assuming BEC appears as a
macroscopic occupation of the k = 0 state below T_c, we find a condensate
fraction of n_0 = (-0.10 \pm 1.20)% at T = 80 mK and n_0 = (0.08\pm0.78)% at T
= 120 mK, consistent with zero. The shape of n(k) also does not change on
crossing T_c within measurement precision.",2007-02-14T23:01:59Z
Spinning particles in General Relativity,"We analyze the behavior of a spinning particle in gravity, both from a
quantum and a classical point of view. We infer that, since the interaction
between the space-time curvature and a spinning test particle is expected, then
the main features of such an interaction can get light on which degrees of
freedom have physical meaning in a quantum gravity theory with fermions.
Finally, the dimensional reduction of Papapetrou equations is performed in a
5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein background and Dixon-Souriau results for the motion
of a charged spinning body are obtained.",2007-01-15T14:37:23Z
"Van Hove singularity and spontaneous Fermi surface symmetry breaking in
  Sr3Ru2O7","The most salient features observed around a metamagnetic transition in
Sr3Ru2O7 are well captured in a simple model for spontaneous Fermi surface
symmetry breaking under a magnetic field, without invoking a putative quantum
critical point. The Fermi surface symmetry breaking happens in both a majority
and a minority spin band but with a different magnitude of the order parameter,
when either band is tuned close to van Hove filling by the magnetic field. The
transition is second order for high temperature T and changes into first order
for low T. The first order transition is accompanied by a metamagnetic
transition. The uniform magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat
coefficient show strong T dependence, especially a log T divergence at van Hove
filling. The Fermi surface instability then cuts off such non-Fermi liquid
behavior and gives rise to a cusp in the susceptibility and a specific heat
jump at the transition temperature.",2007-01-25T18:28:51Z
The Cosmology of f(R) Gravity in the Metric Variational Approach,"We consider the cosmologies that arise in a subclass of f(R) gravity with
f(R)=R+\mu ^{2n+2}/(-R)^{n} and -1<n<0 in the metric (as opposed to the
Palatini) variational approach to deriving the gravitational field equations.
The calculations of the isotropic and homogeneous cosmological models are
undertaken in the Jordan frame and at both the background and the perturbation
levels. For the former, we also discuss the connection to the Einstein frame in
which the extra degree of freedom in the theory is associated with a scalar
field sharing some of the properties of a 'chameleon' field. For the latter, we
derive the cosmological perturbation equations in general theories of f(R)
gravity in covariant form and implement them numerically to calculate the
cosmic-microwave-background temperature and matter-power spectra of the
cosmological model. The CMB power is shown to reduce at low l's, and the matter
power spectrum is almost scale-independent at small scales, thus having a
similar shape to that in standard general relativity. These are in stark
contrast with what was found in the Palatini f(R) gravity, where the CMB power
is largely amplified at low l's and the matter spectrum is strongly
scale-dependent at small scales. These features make the present model more
adaptable than that arising from the Palatini f(R) field equations, and none of
the data on background evolution, CMB power spectrum, or matter power spectrum
currently rule it out.",2007-01-19T21:12:48Z
Graphene Nano-Ribbon Electronics,"We have fabricated graphene nano-ribbon field-effect transistor devices and
investigated their electrical properties as a function of ribbon width. Our
experiments show that the resistivity of a ribbon increases as its width
decreases, indicating the impact of edge states. Analysis of temperature
dependent measurements suggests a finite quantum confinement gap opening in
narrow ribbons. The electrical current noise of the graphene ribbon devices at
low frequency is found to be dominated by the 1/f noise.",2007-01-24T16:03:28Z
A Generic Analysis Environment for Curry Programs,"We present CurryBrowser, a generic analysis environment for the declarative
multi-paradigm language Curry. CurryBrowser supports browsing through the
program code of an application written in Curry, i.e., the main module and all
directly or indirectly imported modules. Each module can be shown in different
formats (e.g., source code, interface, intermediate code) and, inside each
module, various properties of functions defined in this module can be analyzed.
In order to support the integration of various program analyses, CurryBrowser
has a generic interface to connect local and global analyses implemented in
Curry. CurryBrowser is completely implemented in Curry using libraries for GUI

"Linear viscoelasticity of entangled wormlike micelles bridged by
  telechelic polymers : an experimental model for a double transient network","We survey the linear viscoelasticity of a new type of transient network:
bridged wormlike micelles, whose structure has been characterized recently
[Ramos and Ligoure, (2007)]. This composite material is obtained by adding
telechelic copolymers (water-soluble chains with hydrophobic stickers at each
extremity) to a solution of entangled wormlike micelles (WM). For comparison,
naked WM and WM decorated by amphiphilic copolymers are also investigated.
While these latter systems exhibit almost a same single ideal Maxwell behavior,
solutions of bridged WM can be described as two Maxwell fluids components
blends, characterized by two markedly different characteristic times, t_fast
and t_slow, and two elastic moduli, G_fast and G_slow, with G_fast >> G_slow.
We show that the slow mode is related to the viscoelasticity of the transient
network of entangled WM, and the fast mode to the network of telechelic active
chains (i.e. chains that do not form loops but bridge two micelles). The
dependence of the viscoelasticity with the surfactant concentration, phi, and
the sticker-to-surfactant molar ratio, beta, is discussed. In particular, we
show that G_fast is proportional to the number of active chains in the
material, phi beta. Simple theoretical expectations allow then to evaluate the
bridges/loops ratio for the telechelic polymers.",2007-02-05T14:33:06Z

"Ochre decor and Cinnabar Residues in Neolithic Pottery from Vinuca,
  Serbia","The prehistoric site of Vin\u{c}a, on the right bank of the River Danube, the
territory of the City of Belgrade, first excavated by Dr Miloje Vasi\'c;
(1931-1934) provides Neolithic pottery dating back to 5200 - 4200 B.C. Shards
excavated in 1998 (Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) have a yellow coating
on the external (convex) and red deposit on the internal (concave) side. Raman,
IR and X-ray identification prove that yellow-to-red decor deposited on the
external faces of pottery is made of ochre, a mixture of hematite, quartz and
phyllosilicates. Red deposit, found on some internal surfaces of a pottery,
consists of cinnabar (HgS) with some quartz and phyllosilicates. This indicates
that cinnabar was not used for decor but for some other purposes, preparations
made in ceramic utensils. A comparison is made with the mercury ore from a

"Dynamic instability transitions in 1D driven diffusive flow with
  nonlocal hopping","One-dimensional directed driven stochastic flow with competing nonlocal and
local hopping events has an instability threshold from a populated phase into
an empty-road (ER) phase. We implement this in the context of the asymmetric
exclusion process. The nonlocal skids promote strong clustering in the
stationary populated phase. Such clusters drive the dynamic phase transition
and determine its scaling properties. We numerically establish that the
instability transition into the ER phase is second order in the regime where
the entry point reservoir controls the current and first order in the regime
where the bulk is in control. The first order transition originates from a
turn-about of the cluster drift velocity. At the critical line, the current
remains analytic, the road density vanishes linearly, and fluctuations scale as
uncorrelated noise. A self-consistent cluster dynamics analysis explains why
these scaling properties remain that simple.",2007-03-23T08:29:19Z
Gravitational recoil from spinning binary black hole mergers,"The inspiral and merger of binary black holes will likely involve black holes
with both unequal masses and arbitrary spins. The gravitational radiation
emitted by these binaries will carry angular as well as linear momentum. A net
flux of emitted linear momentum implies that the black hole produced by the
merger will experience a recoil or kick. Previous studies have focused on the
recoil velocity from unequal mass, non-spinning binaries. We present results
from simulations of equal mass but spinning black hole binaries and show how a
significant gravitational recoil can also be obtained in these situations. We
consider the case of black holes with opposite spins of magnitude $a$
aligned/anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum, with $a$ the
dimensionless spin parameters of the individual holes. For the initial setups
under consideration, we find a recoil velocity of $V = 475 \KMS a$.
Supermassive black hole mergers producing kicks of this magnitude could result
in the ejection from the cores of dwarf galaxies of the final hole produced by
the collision.",2007-01-26T19:28:53Z
Understanding the Branly effect,"At the end of the nineteenth century \'{E}douard Branly discovered that the
electrical resistance of a granular metallic conductor could drop by several
orders of magnitude when excited by the electromagnetic field emitted by an
electrical spark. Despite the fact that this effect has been used to detect
radio waves in the early times of wireless telegraphy and more recently studied
in the field of granular materials, no satisfactory explanation of the physical
origin of the effect has been given yet. In this contribution we propose to
relate the Branly effect to the induced tunnelling effect first described by
Fran\c{c}ois Bardou and Dominique Boos\'{e}.",2007-03-19T18:27:46Z
Poisson-Bracket Approach to the Dynamics of Bent-Core Molecules,"We generalize our previous work on the phase stability and hydrodynamic of
polar liquid crystals possessing local uniaxial $C_{\infty v}$-symmetry to
biaxial systems exhibiting local $C_{2v}$-symmetry. Our work is motivated by
the recently discovered examples of thermotropic biaxial nematic liquid
crystals comprising bent-core mesogens, whose molecular structure is
characterized by a non-polar body axis $({\bf{n}})$ as well as a polar axis
$({\bf{p}})$ along the bisector of the bent mesogenic core which is coincident
with a large, transverse dipole moment. The free energy for this system differs
from that of biaxial nematic liquid crystals in that it contains terms
violating the ${\bf{p}}\to -{\bf{p}}$ symmetry. We show that, in spite of a
general splay instability associated with these parity-odd terms, a uniform
polarized biaxial state can be stable in a range of parameters. We then derive
the hydrodynamic equations of the system, via the Poisson-bracket formalism, in
the polarized state and comment on the structure of the corresponding linear
hydrodynamic modes. In our Poisson-bracket derivation, we also compute the
flow-alignment parameters along the three symmetry axes in terms of microscopic
parameters associated with the molecular geometry of the constituent biaxial
mesogens.",2007-02-27T21:24:38Z
"Modified Kubelka-Munk equations for localized waves inside a layered

evolution of the average total intensity and intensity flux of a wavefield
inside a randomly layered medium. These equations represent a modification of
the Kubelka-Munk equations, or radiative transfer. Our modification accounts
for wave interference (e.g., localization), which is neglected in radiative

the results to radiative transfer as well as to simulations of the wave
equation with randomly located thin layers.",2007-01-23T19:13:07Z
Spectropolarimetry of cool stars,"In recent years, the development of spectropolarimetric techniques deeply
modified our knowledge of stellar magnetism. In the case of solar-type stars,
the challenge is to measure a geometrically complex field and determine its
evolution over very different time frames. In this article, I summarize some
important observational results obtained in this field over the last two
decades and detail what they tell us about the dynamo processes that
orchestrate the activity of cool stars. I also discuss what we learn from such
observations about the ability of magnetic fields to affect the formation and
evolution of Sun-like stars. Finally, I evoke promising directions to be
explored in the coming years, thanks to the advent of a new generation of

  in the energy spectrum","Quantum control of the wave function of two interacting electrons confined in
quasi-one-dimensional double-well semiconductor structures is demonstrated. The
control strategies are based on the knowledge of the energy spectrum as a
function of an external uniform electric field. When two low-lying levels have
avoided crossings our system behaves dynamically to a large extent as a
two-level system. This characteristic is exploited to implement coherent
control strategies based on slow (adiabatic passage) and rapid (diabatic
Landau-Zener transition) changes of the external field. We apply this method to
reach desired target states that lie far in the spectrum from the initial
state.",2007-03-07T19:10:04Z
"Intramolecular Form Factor in Dense Polymer Systems: Systematic
  Deviations from the Debye formula","We discuss theoretically and numerically the intramolecular form factor
$F(q)$ in dense polymer systems. Following Flory's ideality hypothesis, chains
in the melt adopt Gaussian configurations and their form factor is supposed to
be given by Debye's formula. At striking variance to this, we obtain noticeable
(up to 20%) non-monotonic deviations which can be traced back to the
incompressibility of dense polymer solutions beyond a local scale. The Kratky
plot ($q^2F(q)$ {\it vs.} wavevector $q$) does not exhibit the plateau expected
for Gaussian chains in the intermediate $q$-range. One rather finds a
significant decrease according to the correction $\delta(F^{-1}(q)) =
q^3/32\rho$ that only depends on the concentration $\rho$ of the solution, but
neither on the persistence length or the interaction strength.",2007-01-11T22:49:10Z
"Comments on ""Design and performance evaluation of load distribution
  strategies for multiple loads on heterogeneous linear daisy chain networks''","Min, Veeravalli, and Barlas proposed strategies to minimize the overall
execution time of one or several divisible loads on a heterogeneous linear
network, using one or more installments. We show on a very simple example that
the proposed approach does not always produce a solution and that, when it
does, the solution is often suboptimal. We also show how to find an optimal
scheduling for any instance, once the number of installments per load is given.
Finally, we formally prove that under a linear cost model, as in the original
paper, an optimal schedule has an infinite number of installments. Such a cost
model can therefore not be sed to design practical multi-installment
strategies.",2007-02-10T17:43:35Z
"Probing anomalous relaxation by coherent multidimensional optical
  spectroscopy","We propose to study the origin of algebraic decay of two-point correlation
functions observed in glasses, proteins, and quantum dots by their nonlinear
response to sequences of ultrafast laser pulses. Power-law spectral
singularities and temporal relaxation in two-dimensional correlation
spectroscopy (2DCS) signals are predicted for a continuous time random walk
model of stochastic spectral jumps in a two level system with a power-law
distribution of waiting times $\psi (t)\sim t^{-\alpha -1}$. Spectroscopic
signatures of stationary ensembles for $1<\alpha <2$ and aging effects in
nonstationary ensembles with $0<\alpha <1$ are identified.",2007-01-11T18:15:55Z
Incomplete pure dephasing of N-qubit entangled W states,"We consider qubits in a linear arrangement coupled to a bosonic field which
acts as a quantum heat bath and causes decoherence. By taking the spatial
separation of the qubits explicitly into account, the reduced qubit dynamics
acquires an additional non-Markovian element. We investigate the time evolution
of an entangled many-qubit W state, which for vanishing qubit separation
remains robust under pure dephasing. For finite separation, by contrast, the
dynamics is no longer decoherence-free. On the other hand, spatial noise
correlations may prevent a complete dephasing. While a standard Bloch-Redfield
master equation fails to describe this behavior even qualitatively, we propose
instead a widely applicable causal master equation. Here we employ it to
identify and characterize decoherence-poor subspaces. Consequences for quantum
error correction are discussed.",2007-03-02T19:37:35Z
Vibrational features in inelastic electron tunneling spectra,"A theoretical analysis of inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS)
experiments conducted on molecular junctions are presented, where the second
derivative of the current with respect to voltage is usually plotted as a
function of applied bias. Within the nonperturbative computational scheme,
adequate for arbitrary parameters of the model, we consider the virtual
conduction process in the off-resonance region. Here we study the influence of
few crucial factors on the IETS spectra: the strength of the vibronic coupling,
the phonon energy, and the device working temperature. It was also shown that
weak asymmetry in the IETS signal with respect to bias polarity is obtained as
a result of strongly asymmetric connection with the electrodes.",2007-03-21T19:06:03Z
Scalar functions for wave extraction in numerical relativity,"Wave extraction plays a fundamental role in the binary black hole simulations
currently performed in numerical relativity. Having a well defined procedure
for wave extraction, which matches simplicity with efficiency, is critical
especially when comparing waveforms from different simulations. Recently,
progress has been made in defining a general technique which uses Weyl scalars
to extract the gravitational wave signal, through the introduction of the {\it
quasi-Kinnersley tetrad}. This procedure has been used successfully in current
numerical simulations; however, it involves complicated calculations. The work
in this paper simplifies the procedure by showing that the choice of the {\it
quasi-Kinnersley tetrad} is reduced to the choice of the time-like vector used
to create it. The space-like vectors needed to complete the tetrad are then
easily identified, and it is possible to write the expression for the Weyl
scalars in the right tetrad, as simple functions of the electric and magnetic
parts of the Weyl tensor.",2007-01-31T21:50:30Z
"Self-organization of supercooled liquids confined inside nano-porous
  materials","Large scale molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the
structural and dynamical modifications of supercooled water when confined
inside an hydrophilic nanopore. We then investigate the evolution of the
auto-organization of the most and the least mobile molecules (dynamical
heterogeneity and string-like cooperative motions) when supercooled water is
confined. Our calculations use the recent TIP5P intermolecular potential for
water. We observe a strong slowing down of the dynamical properties when the
liquid is confined, although the liquid structure is found to remain unchanged
when corrected from the pore geometry. We then study cooperative motions inside
supercooled confined water in comparison with bulk water. We observe strong
modifications of the cooperative motions when the liquid is confined. We
observe that dynamical heterogeneities and the associated correlation lengths
are strongly increased as well as string-like motions in the confined liquid.
This result, which is in opposition with the expected limitation of the
correlation length by the confinement procedure, may explain (or be explained
by) the slowing down of the dynamics. However the comparison of the dynamical
heterogeneities at constant diffusion coefficient shows that the slowing down
of the dynamics is not sufficient to explain the increase of the correlation
lengths.",2007-02-23T17:32:02Z
Phonon-assisted decoherence in coupled quantum dots,"We analyse various phonon-assisted mechanisms which contribute to the
decoherence of excitonic qubits in quantum dot systems coupled by the
F\""orster-type transfer process. We show the significant loss of coherence
accompanied by dissipation due to charge carrier oscillations between qubit
states by using a model of one-phonon assisted F\""orster-type transfer process.
We obtain explicit expressions for the relaxation and dephasing times for
excitonic qubits interacting with acoustic phonons via both deformation
potential and piezoelectric coupling. We compare the decoherence times of the
GaAs/AlGaAs material system with half times of concurrence decay in a
2$\otimes$2 bipartite mixed excitonic qubit system. We extend calculations to
determine the influence of phonon mediated interactions on the non-unitary
evolution of Berry phase in quantum dot systems.",2007-02-19T07:45:51Z
"Condensate depletion in two-species Bose gases: A variational Quantum
  Monte Carlo study","We investigate two-species Bose gases in traps with various interactions
using variational Quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) techniques at zero temperature. The
bosons are represented by hard spheres (HS) whose diameter is equivalent to the
s-wave scattering length in the low-energy and long-wavelength approximation.
We explore the role of repulsive and attractive inter- or intraspecies
interactions on the condensate properties of the mixtures, particularly the
condensate fraction of each species as compared to the case when each species
is in a separate trap of its own. We model the repulsive interactions by a hard
core (HC) potential and the attractive interactions by a shallow model
potential. The VMC density profiles and energies are evaluated at various
interactions and two mass ratios of the species.",2007-03-09T16:29:31Z
"Emergence of a non-scaling degree distribution in bipartite networks: a
  numerical and analytical study","We study the growth of bipartite networks in which the number of nodes in one
of the partitions is kept fixed while the other partition is allowed to grow.
We study random and preferential attachment as well as combination of both. We
derive the exact analytical expression for the degree-distribution of all these
different types of attachments while assuming that edges are incorporated
sequentially, i.e., a single edge is added to the growing network in a time
step. We also provide an approximate expression for the case when more than one
edge are added in a time step. We show that depending on the relative weight
between random and preferential attachment, the degree-distribution of this
type of network falls into one of four possible regimes which range from a
binomial distribution for pure random attachment to an u-shaped distribution
for dominant preferential attachment.",2007-03-23T23:26:04Z
"Supermassive black holes in the Sbc spiral galaxies NGC 3310, NGC 4303
  and NGC 4258","We present new Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) observations of
three spiral galaxies, NGC 4303, NGC 3310 and NGC 4258. The bright optical
emission lines H$\alpha$ $\lambda$ $6564 \AA$, [NII] $\lambda$$\lambda$
$6549,6585 \AA$ and [SII] $\lambda$$\lambda$ $ 6718,6732 \AA$ were used to
study the kinematics of the ionized gas in the nuclear region of each galaxy
with a $\sim 0.07\arcsec$ spatial resolution. In NGC 3310, the observed gas
kinematics is well matched by a circularly rotating disk model but we are only
able to set an upper limit to the BH mass which, taking into account the
allowed disk inclinations, varies in the range $5.0 \times 10^{6} - 4.2 \times
10^{7} M_{\odot}$ at the 95% confidence level. In NGC 4303 the kinematical data
require the presence of a BH with mass $M_{BH}=(5.0)^{+0.87}_{-2.26}\times
10^{6}M_{\odot}$ (for a disk inclination $i=70$ deg).In NGC 4258, the observed
kinematics require the presence of a black hole with $M_{BH}=
(7.9)^{+6.2}_{-3.5} \times 10^{7}M_{\odot}$ ($i=60$ deg). This result is in
good agreement with the published value $(3.9 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{7}
M_{\odot}$, derived from $H_{2}O$-maser observations. Our attempt at measuring
BH masses in these 3 late type Sbc spiral galaxies has shown that these
measurements are very challenging and at the limit of the highest spatial
resolution currently available. Nonetheless our estimates are in good agreement
with the scaling relations between black holes and their host spheroids
suggesting that (i) they are reliable and (ii) black holes in spiral galaxies
follows the same scaling relations as those in more massive early-type
galaxies. A crucial test for the gas kinematical method, the correct recovery
of the known BH mass in NGC 4258, has been successful. [abridged]",2007-03-07T14:29:10Z
Fast quantum noise in Landau-Zener transition,"We show by direct calculation starting from a microscopic model that the
two-state system with time-dependent energy levels in the presence of fast
quantum noise obeys the master equation. The solution of master equation is
found analytically and analyzed in a broad range of parameters. The fast
transverse noise affects the transition probability during much longer time
(the accumulation time) than the longitudinal one. The action of the fast
longitudinal noise is restricted by the shorter Landau-Zener time, the same as
in the regular Landau-Zener process. The large ratio of time scales allows
solving the Landau-Zener problem with longitudinal noise only, then solving the
same problem with the transverse noise only and matching the two solutions. The
correlation of the longitudinal and transverse noise renormalizes the
Landau-Zener transition matrix element and can strongly enhance the survival
probability, whereas the transverse noise always reduces it. Both longitudinal
and transverse noise reduce the coherence. The decoherence time is inverse
proportional to the noise intensity. If the noise is fast, its intensity at
which the multi-quantum processes become essential corresponds to a deeply
adiabatic regime. We briefly discuss possible applications of the general
theory to the problem of the qubit decoherence and to the spin relaxation of
molecular magnets.",2007-02-20T23:49:26Z
Dynamical scaling in branching models for seismicity,"We propose a branching process based on a dynamical scaling hypothesis
relating time and mass. In the context of earthquake occurrence, we show that
experimental power laws in size and time distribution naturally originate
solely from this scaling hypothesis. We present a numerical protocol able to
generate a synthetic catalog with an arbitrary large number of events. The
numerical data reproduce the hierarchical organization in time and magnitude of
experimental inter-event time distribution.",2007-01-30T10:34:25Z
"Polymer translocation through a nanopore - a showcase of anomalous
  diffusion","The translocation dynamics of a polymer chain through a nanopore in the
absence of an external driving force is analyzed by means of scaling arguments,
fractional calculus, and computer simulations. The problem at hand is mapped on
a one dimensional {\em anomalous} diffusion process in terms of reaction
coordinate $s$ (i.e. the translocated number of segments at time $t$) and shown
to be governed by an universal exponent $\alpha = 2/(2\nu+2-\gamma_1)$ whose
value is nearly the same in two- and three-dimensions. The process is described
by a {\em fractional} diffusion equation which is solved exactly in the
interval $0 <s < N$ with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. The
solution gives the probability distribution of translocation times as well as
the variation with time of the statistical moments: $<s(t)>$, and $<s^2(t)> - <
s(t)>^2$ which provide full description of the diffusion process. The
comparison of the analytic results with data derived from extensive Monte Carlo
(MC) simulations reveals very good agreement and proves that the diffusion
dynamics of unbiased translocation through a nanopore is anomalous in its
nature.",2007-01-26T17:01:27Z
"A Comparison of Five Probabilistic View-Size Estimation Techniques in
  OLAP","A data warehouse cannot materialize all possible views, hence we must
estimate quickly, accurately, and reliably the size of views to determine the
best candidates for materialization. Many available techniques for view-size
estimation make particular statistical assumptions and their error can be
large. Comparatively, unassuming probabilistic techniques are slower, but they
estimate accurately and reliability very large view sizes using little memory.
We compare five unassuming hashing-based view-size estimation techniques
including Stochastic Probabilistic Counting and LogLog Probabilistic Counting.
Our experiments show that only Generalized Counting, Gibbons-Tirthapura, and
Adaptive Counting provide universally tight estimates irrespective of the size
of the view; of those, only Adaptive Counting remains constantly fast as we
increase the memory budget.",2007-03-13T17:46:11Z
"Ground-state structure and stability of dipolar condensates in
  anisotropic traps","We study the Hartree ground state of a dipolar condensate of atoms or
molecules in an three-dimensional anisotropic geometry and at T=0. We determine
the stability of the condensate as a function of the aspect ratios of the trap
frequencies and of the dipolar strength. We find numerically a rich phase space
structure characterized by various structures of the ground-state density
profile.",2007-03-01T22:41:48Z
Constraints on Generalized Dark Energy from Recent Observations,"Effects of a generalized dark energy fluid is investigated on cosmic density
fluctuations such as cosmic microwave background. As a general dark energy
fluid, we take into consideration the possibility of the anisotropic stress for
dark energy, which has not been discussed much in the literature. We
comprehensively study its effects on the evolution of density fluctuations
along with that of non-adiabatic pressure fluctuation of dark energy, then give
constraints on such a generalized dark energy from current observations. We
show that, though we cannot find any stringent limits on the anisotropic stress
or the non-adiabatic pressure fluctuation themselves, the constrains on the
equation of state of dark energy can be affected in some cases by the nature of
dark energy fluctuation characterized by these properties. This may have
important implications to the strategy to study the nature of dark energy.",2007-03-21T06:48:28Z
"Ab initio molecular dynamics study of manganese porphine hydration and
  interaction with nitric oxide","The authors use ab initio molecular dynamics and the density functional
theory+U (DFT+U) method to compute the hydration environment of the manganese
ion in manganese (II) and manganese (III) porphines (MnP) dispersed in liquid
water. These are intended as simple models for more complex water soluble
porphyrins, which have important physiological and electrochemical
applications. The manganese ion in Mn(II)P exhibits significant out-of-porphine
plane displacement and binds strongly to a single H2O molecule in liquid water.
The Mn in Mn(III)P is on average coplanar with the porphine plane and forms a
stable complex with two H2O molecules. The residence times of these water
molecules exceed 15 ps. The DFT+U method correctly predicts that water
displaces NO from Mn(III)P-NO, but yields an ambiguous spin state for the
MnP(II)-NO complex.",2007-01-23T18:26:07Z
Sending a Bivariate Gaussian Source over a Gaussian MAC with Feedback,"We consider the problem of transmitting a bivariate Gaussian source over a
two-user additive Gaussian multiple-access channel with feedback. Each of the
transmitters observes one of the source components and tries to describe it to
the common receiver. We are interested in the minimal mean squared error at
which the receiver can reconstruct each of the source components.
  In the ``symmetric case'' we show that, below a certain signal-to-noise ratio
threshold which is determined by the source correlation, feedback is useless
and the minimal distortion is achieved by uncoded transmission. For the general
case we give necessary conditions for the achievability of a distortion pair.",2007-01-08T17:20:08Z
Charge Ordering in Amorphous WO$_{x}$ Films,"We report on the observation of highly anisotropic viscous electronic
conducting phase in amorphous WO$_{1.55}$ films that occurs below a current
(I)- and frequency (f)- dependent temperature T*(I, f). At T < T*(I, f) the
rotational symmetry of randomly disordered electronic background is broken
leading to the appearance of mutually perpendicular metallic- and
insulating-like states. A rich dynamic behavior of the electronic matter
occurring at T < T*(I, f) provides evidence for an interplay between pinning
effects and electron-electron interactions. The results strongly suggest a
dynamic crystallization of the disordered electronic matter, viz. formation of
sliding Wigner crystal, as well as the occurrence of quantum smectic or stripe
phase in the pinning-dominated regime.",2007-01-11T12:07:47Z
"Equation of state of cubic boron nitride at high pressures and
  temperatures","We report accurate measurements of the equation of state (EOS) of cubic boron
nitride by x-ray diffraction up to 160 GPa at 295 K and 80 GPa in the range
500-900 K. Experiments were performed on single-crystals embedded in a
quasi-hydrostatic pressure medium (helium or neon). Comparison between the
present EOS data at 295 K and literature allows us to critically review the
recent calibrations of the ruby standard. The full P-V-T data set can be
represented by a Mie-Gr\""{u}neisen model, which enables us to extract all
relevant thermodynamic parameters: bulk modulus and its first
pressure-derivative, thermal expansion coefficient, thermal Gr\""{u}neisen
parameter and its volume dependence. This equation of state is used to
determine the isothermal Gr\""{u}neisen mode parameter of the Raman TO band. A
new formulation of the pressure scale based on this Raman mode, using
physically-constrained parameters, is deduced.",2007-02-27T19:25:44Z
Critical fields for vortex expulsion from narrow superconducting strips,"We calculate the critical magnetic fields for vortex expulsion for an
infinitely long superconducting strip, using the Ginzburg-Landau formalism. Two
critical fields can be defined associated with the disappearance of either the
energetic stability or metastability of vortices in the center of the strip for
decreasing magnetic fields. We compare the theoretical predictions for the
critical fields in the London formalism with ours and with recently published
experimental results. As expected, for narrow strips our results reproduce
better the experimental findings.",2007-03-28T01:20:56Z
"Optical and spectral properties of quantum domain-walls in the
  generalized Wigner lattice","We study the spectral properties of a system of electrons interacting through
long-range Coulomb potential on a one-dimensional chain. When the interactions
dominate over the electronic bandwidth, the charges arrange in an ordered
configuration that minimizes the electrostatic energy, forming Hubbard's
generalized Wigner lattice. In such strong coupling limit, the low energy
excitations are quantum domain-walls that behave as fractionalized charges, and
can be bound in excitonic pairs. Neglecting higher order excitations, the
system properties are well described by an effective Hamiltonian in the
subspace with one pair of domain-walls, which can be solved exactly. The
optical conducitivity $\sigma(\omega)$ and the spectral function $A(k,\omega)$
can be calculated analytically, and reveal unique features of the unscreened
Coulomb interactions that can be directly observed in experiments.",2007-01-17T14:08:29Z
"ROXA J081009.9+384757.0: a $10^{47}$ erg/s blazar with hard X-ray
  synchrotron peak or a new type of radio loud AGN?","We report the discovery of ROXA J081009.9+384757.0 = SDSS J081009.9+384757.0,
a z=3.95 blazar with a highly unusual Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). This
object was first noticed as a probable high $f_x/f_r$, high-luminosity blazar
within the error region of a $\approx 10^{-12}$ erg/s cm$^2$ ROSAT source
which, however, also included a much brighter late-type star. We describe the
results of a recent Swift observation that establishes beyond doubt that the
correct counterpart of the X-ray source is the flat spectrum radio quasar. With
a luminosity well in excess of $10^{47}$ erg/s, ROXA J081009.9+384757.0 is
therefore one of the most luminous blazars known. We consider various
possibilities for the nature of the electromagnetic emission from this source.
In particular, we show that the SED is consistent with that of a blazar with
synchrotron power peaking in the hard X-ray band. If this is indeed the case,
the combination of high-luminosity and synchrotron peak in the hard-X-ray band
contradicts the claimed anti-correlation between luminosity and position of the
synchrotron peak usually referred to as the ""blazar sequence"". An alternative
possibility is that the X-rays are not due to synchrotron emission, in this
case the very peculiar SED of ROXA J081009.9+384757.0 would make it the first
example of a new class of radio loud AGN.",2007-03-19T15:42:50Z
"Electronic structure and magnetism in the frustrated antiferromagnet
  LiCrO2","LiCrO2 is a 2D triangular antiferromagnet, isostructural with the common
battery material LiCoO2 and a well-known Jahn-Teller antiferromagnet NaNiO2. As
opposed to the latter, LiCrO2 exibits antiferromagnetic exchange in Cr planes,
which has been ascribed to direct Cr-Cr d-d overlap. Using LDA and LDA+U first
principles calculations I confirm this conjecture and show that (a) direct d-d
overlap is indeed enhanced compared to isostructural Ni and Cr compounds, (b)
p-d charge transfer gap is also enhanced, thus suppressing the ferromagnetic
superexchange, (c) the calculated magnetic Hamiltonian maps well onto the
nearest neighbors Heisenberg exchange model and (d) interplanar inteaction is
antiferromagnetic.",2007-01-22T15:20:10Z
"A simple environment-dependent overlap potential and Cauchy violation in
  solid argon","We develop an analytic and environment-dependent interatomic potential for
the overlap repulsion in solid argon, based on an approximate treatment of the
non-orthogonal Tight-Binding theory for the closed-shell systems. The present
model can well reproduce the observed elastic properties of solid argon
including Cauchy violation at high pressures, yet very simple. A useful and
novel analysis is given to show how the elastic properties are related to the
environment-dependence incorporated into a generic pairwise potential. The
present study has a close link to the broad field of computational materials
science, in which the inclusion of environment dependence in short-ranged
repulsive part of a potential model is sometimes crucial in predicting the
elastic properties correctly.",2007-01-09T16:47:58Z
Dissipation effects in percolating quantum Ising magnets,"We study the effects of dissipation on a randomly dilute transverse-field
Ising magnet at and close to the percolation threshold. For weak transverse
fields, a novel percolation quantum phase transition separates a
super-paramagnetic cluster phase from an inhomogeneously ordered ferromagnetic
phase. The properties of this transition are dominated by large frozen and
slowly fluctuating percolation clusters. Implementing numerically a
strong-disorder real space renormalization group technique, we compute the
low-energy density of states which is found to be in good agreement with the
analytical prediction.",2007-03-21T18:02:55Z
"Confinement of fractional quantum Hall states in narrow conducting

quasiparticle manipulation and is an important step towards quasiparticle
interference measurements. Demonstrated here is conduction through top gate
defined, narrow channels in high density, ultra-high mobility heterostructures.
Transport evidence for the persistence of a correlated state at filling

"Optical absorption induced by UV laser radiation in Ge-doped amorphous
  silica probed by in situ spectroscopy","We studied the optical absorption induced by 4.7eV pulsed laser radiation on
Ge-doped a-SiO2 synthesized by a sol-gel technique. The absorption spectra in
the ultraviolet spectral range were measured during and after the end of
irradiation with an in situ technique, evidencing the growth of an absorption
signal whose profile is characterized by two main peaks near 4.5eV and 5.7eV
and whose shape depends on time. Electron spin resonance measurements performed
ex situ a few hours after the end of exposure permit to complete the
information acquired by optical absorption by detection of the paramagnetic
Ge(1) and Ge-E' centers laser-induced in the samples.",2007-03-02T14:05:22Z
Light Propagation and Large-Scale Inhomogeneities,"We consider the effect on the propagation of light of inhomogeneities with
sizes of order 10 Mpc or larger. The Universe is approximated through a
variation of the Swiss-cheese model. The spherical inhomogeneities are
void-like, with central underdensities surrounded by compensating overdense
shells. We study the propagation of light in this background, assuming that the
source and the observer occupy random positions, so that each beam travels
through several inhomogeneities at random angles. The distribution of
luminosity distances for sources with the same redshift is asymmetric, with a
peak at a value larger than the average one. The width of the distribution and
the location of the maximum increase with increasing redshift and length scale
of the inhomogeneities. We compute the induced dispersion and bias on
cosmological parameters derived from the supernova data. They are too small to
explain the perceived acceleration without dark energy, even when the length
scale of the inhomogeneities is comparable to the horizon distance. Moreover,
the dispersion and bias induced by gravitational lensing at the scales of
galaxies or clusters of galaxies are larger by at least an order of magnitude.",2007-03-22T15:17:12Z
Localized steady-state domain wall oscillators,"We predict a spatially localized magnetic domain wall oscillator upon the
application of an external magnetic field and a DC electric current. The

source for information storage application.",2007-03-04T20:47:01Z
Coarse-Graining and Scaling in Dissipative Particle Dynamics,"Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is now a well-established method for
simulating soft matter systems. However, its applicability was recently
questioned because some investigations showed an upper coarse-graining limit
that would prevent the applicability of the method to the whole mesoscopic
range. This article aims to reestablish DPD as a truly scale-free method by
analyzing the problems reported by other authors and by presenting a scaling
scheme that allows one to gauge a DPD-simulation to any desired length scale.",2007-03-26T16:33:42Z
"Low temperature conduction behavior in highly crystallized undoped
  microcrystalline silicon thin films","The temperature dependence of dark conductivity at low temperatures (300-15
K) was studied on a wide microstructural range of well-characterized highly
crystallized single phase undoped microcrystalline silicon samples. Our study
reveals two different temperature dependences in films having different
microstructures. A T^(-0.5) dependence of dark conductivity supporting
tunneling of carriers between neighboring conducting crystals, similar to
percolation-hopping model proposed for metal-insulator composite systems, is
seen in microcrystalline silicon films that are fully crystallized with tightly
packed large columnar grains and negligible density deficit. A
T^(-0.25)dependence of dark conductivity supporting variable range hopping
model with an exponential tail state distribution in the gap is seen in
microcrystalline silicon films having mostly small crystalline grains, low
degree of conglomeration and relatively higher density deficit. The correlation
between the microstructural attributes and conductivity behavior is discussed
by analyzing the physical plausibility of the hopping parameters and material
properties derived by applying different transport models.",2007-02-16T10:27:06Z
Modeling microscopic swimmers at low Reynolds number,"We employ three numerical methods to explore the motion of low Reynolds
number swimmers, modeling the hydrodynamic interactions by means of the Oseen
tensor approximation, lattice Boltzmann simulations and multiparticle collision
dynamics. By applying the methods to a three bead linear swimmer, for which
exact results are known, we are able to compare and assess the effectiveness of
the different approaches. We then propose a new class of low Reynolds number
swimmers, generalized three bead swimmers that can change both the length of
their arms and the angle between them. Hence we suggest a design for a
microstructure capable of moving in three dimensions. We discuss multiple bead,
linear microstructures and show that they are highly efficient swimmers. We
then turn to consider the swimming motion of elastic filaments. Using
multiparticle collision dynamics we show that a driven filament behaves in a
qualitatively similar way to the micron-scale swimming device recently
demonstrated by Dreyfus et al.",2007-01-22T10:35:21Z
"Metamorphosis of a Quantum Hall Bilayer State into a Composite Fermion
  Metal","Composite fermion metal states emerge in quantum Hall bilayers at total
Landau level filling factor $\nu_T$=1 when the tunneling gap collapses by
application of in-plane components of the external magnetic field. Evidence of
this transformation is found in the continua of spin excitations observed by
inelastic light scattering below the spin-wave mode at the Zeeman energy. The
low-lying spin modes are interpreted as quasiparticle excitations with
simultaneous changes in spin orientation and composite fermion Landau level
index.",2007-02-13T18:07:37Z
"Rapid Multiwaveband Polarization Variability in the Quasar PKS 0420-014:
  Optical Emission from the Compact Radio Jet","An 11-day monitoring campaign in late 2005 reveals clear correlation in
polarization between the optical emission and the region of the intensity peak
(the ""pseudocore"") at the upstream end of the jet in 43 GHz Very Long Baseline
Array images in the highly variable quasar PKS 0420-014. The electric-vector
position angle (EVPA) of the pseudocore rotated by about 80 degrees in four
VLBA observations over a period of nine days, matching the trend of the optical
EVPA. In addition, the 43 GHz EVPAs agree well with the optical values when we
correct the former for Faraday rotation. Fluctuations in the polarization at
both wavebands are consistent with the variable emission arising from a
standing conical shock wave that compresses magnetically turbulent plasma in
the ambient jet. The volume of the variable component is the same at both
wavebands, although only ~20% of the total 43 GHz emission arises from this
site. The remainder of the 43 GHz flux density must originate in a separate
region with very low polarization. If 0420-014 is a typical case, the
nonthermal optical emission from blazars originates primarily in and near the
pseudocore rather than closer to the central engine where the flow collimates
and accelerates.",2007-03-06T15:02:37Z
Triplet absorption in carbon nanotubes: a TD-DFT study,"We predict properties of triplet excited states in single-walled carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) using a time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT). We
show that the lowest triplet state energy in CNTs to be about 0.2-0.3 eV lower
than the lowest singlet states. Like in $\pi$-conjugated polymers, the lowest
CNT triplets are spatially localized. These states show strong optical
absorption at about 0.5-0.6 eV to the higher lying delocalized triplet states.
These results demonstrate striking similarity of the electronic features
between CNTs and $\pi$-conjugated polymers and provide explicit guidelines for
spectroscopic detection of CNT triplet states.",2007-02-13T23:53:37Z
Statistical Mechanics of Semiflexible Bundles of Wormlike Polymer Chains,"We demonstrate that a semiflexible bundle of wormlike chains exhibits a
state-dependent bending stiffness that alters fundamentally its scaling
behavior with respect to the standard wormlike chain. We explore the
equilibrium conformational and mechanical behavior of wormlike bundles in
isolation, in crosslinked networks, and in solution.",2007-02-05T11:05:30Z
"Exact steady-state velocity of ratchets driven by random sequential
  adsorption","We solve the problem of discrete translocation of a polymer through a pore,
driven by the irreversible, random sequential adsorption of particles on one
side of the pore. Although the kinetics of the wall motion and the deposition
are coupled, we find the exact steady-state distribution for the gap between
the wall and the nearest deposited particle. This result enables us to
construct the mean translocation velocity demonstrating that translocation is
faster when the adsorbing particles are smaller. Monte-Carlo simulations also
show that smaller particles gives less dispersion in the ratcheted motion. We
also define and compare the relative efficiencies of ratcheting by deposition
of particles with different sizes and we describe an associated
""zone-refinement"" process.",2007-03-28T05:38:08Z
"Electronic structure of epitaxial graphene layers on SiC: effect of the
  substrate","Recent transport measurements on thin graphite films grown on SiC show large
coherence lengths and anomalous integer quantum Hall effects expected for
isolated graphene sheets. This is the case eventhough the layer-substrate
epitaxy of these films implies a strong interface bond that should induce
perturbations in the graphene electronic structure. Our DFT calculations
confirm this strong substrate-graphite bond in the first adsorbed carbon layer
that prevents any graphitic electronic properties for this layer. However, the
graphitic nature of the film is recovered by the second and third absorbed
layers. This effect is seen in both the (0001)and $(000\bar{1})$ 4H SiC
surfaces. We also present evidence of a charge transfer that depends on the
interface geometry. It causes the graphene to be doped and gives rise to a gap
opening at the Dirac point after 3 carbon layers are deposited in agreement
with recent ARPES experiments (T.Ohta et al, Science {\bf 313} (2006) 951).",2007-02-13T15:59:36Z
Proposal for detection of non-Markovian decay via current noise,"We propose to detect non-Markovian decay of an exciton qubit coupled to
multi-mode bosonic reservoir via shot-noise measurements. Non-equilibrium
current noise is calculated for a quantum dot embedded inside a \QTR{it}{p-i-n}
junction. An additional term from non-Markovian effect is obtained in the
derivation of noise spectrum. As examples, two practical photonic reservoirs,
photon vacuum with the inclusion of cut-off frequency and surface plasmons, are
given to show that the noise may become super-Poissonian due to this
non-Markovian effect. Utilizing the property of super-radiance is further
suggested to enhance the noise value.",2007-01-23T03:47:00Z
Spatially resolved photo ionization of ultracold atoms on an atom chip,"We report on photo ionization of ultracold magnetically trapped Rb atoms on
an atom chip. The atoms are trapped at 5 $\mu $K in a strongly anisotropic
trap. Through a hole in the chip with a diameter of 150 $\mu $m two laser beams
are focussed onto a fraction of the atomic cloud. A first laser beam with a
wavelength of 778 nm excites the atoms via a two photon transition to the 5D
level. With a fiber laser at 1080 nm the excited atoms are photo ionized.
Ionization leads to depletion of the atomic density distribution observed by
absorption imaging. The resonant ionization spectrum is reported. The setup
used in this experiment is not only suitable to investigate BEC ion mixtures
but also single atom detection on an atom chip.",2007-02-08T16:09:58Z

A moment approach to non-Gaussian colored noises,"The Langevin system subjected to non-Gaussian noise has been discussed, by
using the second-order moment approach with two kinds of models for generating
the noise. We have derived the effective differential equation (DE) for a
variable $x$, from which the stationary probability distribution $P(x)$ has
been calculated with the use of the Fokker-Planck equation. The result of
$P(x)$ calculated by the moment method is compared to several expressions
obtained by different methods such as the universal colored noise approximation
(UCNA) [Jung and H\""{a}nggi, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 35}, 4464 (1987)] and the
functional-integral method. It has been shown that our $P(x)$ is in good
agreement with that of direct simulations (DSs). We have also discussed
dynamical properties of the model with an external input, solving DEs in the
moment method.",2007-01-07T22:49:01Z
Centipede ladder at quarter filling,"We study the ground state and excitation spectrum of a quasi one-dimensional
nanostructure consisting of a pole and rungs oriented in the opposite
directions (""centipede ladder"", CL) at quarter filling. The spin and charge
excitation spectra are found in the limits of small and large longitudinal
hopping $t_\|$ compared to the on-rung hopping rate $t_\perp$ and exchange
coupling $I_\perp$. At small $t_\|$ the system with ferromagnetic on-rung
exchange demonstrates instability against dimerization. Coherent propagation of
charge transfer excitons is possible in this limit. At large $t_\|$ CL behaves
like two-orbital Hubbard chain, but the gap opens in the charge excitation
spectrum thus reducing the symmetry from SU(4) to SU(2). The spin excitations
are always gapless and their dispersion changes from quadratic magnon-like for
ferromagnetic on-rung exchange to linear spinon-like for antiferromagnetic
on-rung exchange in weak longitudinal hopping limit.",2007-02-13T15:21:12Z
"The SU(2) Gauge Theory of the Substantially Doped Mott-Insulator: the
  phase separated d+s superconductor","We reformulate the mean-field theory associated with the SU(2) gauge theory
of spin-charge separation in doped Mott-insulators of Wen and Lee so that it
can deal with the regime of substantial carrier density. We find that it
describes remarkably accurately phase separation tendencies. Moreover, for
elegant reasons the theory insists that the superconducting state should have a
d+s orderparameter with an s-wave component growing in the overdoped regime.
This appears to be consistent with both Raman- and tunneling measurements in
cuprate superconductors.",2007-02-15T16:14:13Z
The Fibers and Range of Reduction Graphs in Ciliates,"The biological process of gene assembly has been modeled based on three types
of string rewriting rules, called string pointer rules, defined on so-called
legal strings. It has been shown that reduction graphs, graphs that are based
on the notion of breakpoint graph in the theory of sorting by reversal, for
legal strings provide valuable insights into the gene assembly process. We
characterize which legal strings obtain the same reduction graph (up to
isomorphism), and moreover we characterize which graphs are (isomorphic to)
reduction graphs.",2007-02-07T12:59:22Z
"Ochre decor and Cinnabar Residues in Neolithic Pottery from Vinuca,
  Serbia","The prehistoric site of Vin\u{c}a, on the right bank of the River Danube, the
territory of the City of Belgrade, first excavated by Dr Miloje Vasi\'c;
(1931-1934) provides Neolithic pottery dating back to 5200 - 4200 B.C. Shards
excavated in 1998 (Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) have a yellow coating
on the external (convex) and red deposit on the internal (concave) side. Raman,
IR and X-ray identification prove that yellow-to-red decor deposited on the
external faces of pottery is made of ochre, a mixture of hematite, quartz and
phyllosilicates. Red deposit, found on some internal surfaces of a pottery,
consists of cinnabar (HgS) with some quartz and phyllosilicates. This indicates
that cinnabar was not used for decor but for some other purposes, preparations
made in ceramic utensils. A comparison is made with the mercury ore from a
Suplja Stena mine located ~ 20 km from the Vin\u{c}a village.",2007-01-12T18:52:43Z
Spin chain simulations with a meron cluster algorithm,"We apply a meron cluster algorithm to the XY spin chain, which describes a
quantum rotor. This is a multi-cluster simulation supplemented by an improved
estimator, which deals with objects of half-integer topological charge. This
method is powerful enough to provide precise results for the model with a
theta-term - it is therefore one of the rare examples, where a system with a
complex action can be solved numerically. In particular we measure the
correlation length, as well as the topological and magnetic susceptibility. We
discuss the algorithmic efficiency in view of the critical slowing down. Due to
the excellent performance that we observe, it is strongly motivated to work on
new applications of meron cluster algorithms in higher dimensions.",2007-01-15T14:38:48Z
"Control of magnetic anisotropy in (Ga,Mn)As by lithography-induced
  strain relaxation","We obtain control of magnetic anisotropy in epitaxial (Ga,Mn)As by
anisotropic strain relaxation in patterned structures. The strain in the
structures is characterized using sophisticated X-ray techniques. The magnetic
anisotropy before patterning of the layer, which shows biaxial easy axes along
[100] and [010], is replaced by a hard axis in the direction of large elastic
strain relaxation and a uniaxial easy axis in the direction where pseudomorphic
conditions are retained. This strong anisotropy can not be explained by shape
anisotropy and is attributed solely to lattice strain relaxation. Upon
increasing the uniaxial strain anisotropy in the (Ga,Mn)As stripes, we also
observe an increase in magnetic anisotropy.",2007-01-19T14:22:55Z
"Phase diagram and spin Hamiltonian of weakly-coupled anisotropic S=1/2
  chains in CuCl2*2((CD3)2SO)","Field-dependent specific heat and neutron scattering measurements were used
to explore the antiferromagnetic S=1/2 chain compound CuCl2 * 2((CD3)2SO). At
zero field the system acquires magnetic long-range order below TN=0.93K with an
ordered moment of 0.44muB. An external field along the b-axis strengthens the
zero-field magnetic order, while fields along the a- and c-axes lead to a
collapse of the exchange stabilized order at mu0 Hc=6T and mu0 Hc=3.5T,
respectively (for T=0.65K) and the formation of an energy gap in the excitation
spectrum. We relate the field-induced gap to the presence of a staggered
g-tensor and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, which lead to effective
staggered fields for magnetic fields applied along the a- and c-axes.
Competition between anisotropy, inter-chain interactions and staggered fields
leads to a succession of three phases as a function of field applied along the
c-axis. For fields greater than mu0 Hc, we find a magnetic structure that
reflects the symmetry of the staggered fields. The critical exponent, beta, of
the temperature driven phase transitions are indistinguishable from those of
the three-dimensional Heisenberg magnet, while measurements for transitions
driven by quantum fluctuations produce larger values of beta.",2007-01-11T06:07:24Z
Propagation of short pulses through a Bose-Einstein condensate,"We study propagation of short laser pulses in a Bose-Einstein condensate
taking into account dispersive effects under the conditions for
electromagnetically induced transparency. We calculate dispersion coefficients
using typical experimental parameters of slow-light schemes in condensates. By
numerically propagating the laser pulse, and referring to theoretical
estimations, we determine the conditions for which dispersion starts to
introduce distortions on the pulse shape.",2007-01-16T22:10:38Z
"3.2 mm lightcurve observations of (4) Vesta and (9) Metis with the
  Australia Telescope Compact Array","(4) Vesta and (9) Metis are large main-belt asteroids with high albedos. With
millimetre-observations at 93.0 and 95.5 GHz we characterised the emission
properties of the surface material. The coverage of the full rotation period
allowed a detailed study of the heterogeneity of the surface. The rotationally
averaged fluxes are explained very well by our thermophysical model techniques
when using an emissivity in the mm-range of about 0.6 for (4) Vesta and about
0.7 for (9) Metis. The mm-lightcurves follow for a large fraction of the
rotation period the shape-introduced variations. The rotational phases with
clear deviations are connected to structures which are visible in the HST
images of (4) Vesta and the Keck AO-images of (9) Metis. The observed
lightcurve amplitudes are peak-to-peak ~30% for (4) Vesta and ~25% for (9)
Metis, while the shape-related amplitudes are only 5 and 4%, respectively. The
emissivities at mm-wavelengths are lower than in the far-IR, confirming that
particles with sizes of about 100 mikron influence the mm-behaviour. The 3-mm
observations are very powerful for the study of asteroid surface
heterogeneities.",2007-03-09T18:49:18Z
Polygraphic programs and polynomial-time functions,"We study the computational model of polygraphs. For that, we consider
polygraphic programs, a subclass of these objects, as a formal description of
first-order functional programs. We explain their semantics and prove that they
form a Turing-complete computational model. Their algebraic structure is used
by analysis tools, called polygraphic interpretations, for complexity analysis.
In particular, we delineate a subclass of polygraphic programs that compute
exactly the functions that are Turing-computable in polynomial time.",2007-01-05T18:05:48Z
"On the accuracy of first-principles lateral interactions: Oxygen at
  Pd(100)","We employ a first-principles lattice-gas Hamiltonian (LGH) approach to
determine the lateral interactions between O atoms adsorbed on the Pd(100)
surface. With these interactions we obtain an ordering behavior at low coverage
that is in quantitative agreement with experimental data. Uncertainties in the
approach arise from the finite LGH expansion and from the approximate
exchange-correlation (xc) functional underlying the employed density-functional
theory energetics. We carefully scrutinize these uncertainties and conclude
that they primarily affect the on-site energy, which rationalizes the agreement
with the experimental critical temperatures for the order-disorder transition.
We also investigate the validity of the frequently applied assumption that the
ordering energies can be represented by a sum of pair terms. Restricting our
LGH expansion to just pairwise lateral interactions, we find that this results
in effective interactions which contain spurious contributions that are of
equal size, if not larger than any of the uncertainties e.g. due to the
approximate xc functional.",2007-01-23T12:57:34Z
STM observation of initial growth of Sn atoms on Ge(001) surface,"We have studied initial growth of Sn atoms on Ge(001) surfaces at room
temperature and 80 K by scanning tunneling microscopy. For Sn deposition onto
the Ge(001) substrate at room temperature, the Sn atoms form two kinds of
one-dimensional structures composed of ad-dimers with different alignment, in
the <310> and the <110> directions, and epitaxial structures. For Sn deposition
onto the substrate at 80 K, the population of the dimer chains aligning in the
<310> direction increases. The diffusion barrier of the Sn adatom on the
substrate kinetically determines the population of the dimer chain. We propose
that the diffusion barrier height depends on surface strain induced by the
adatom. The two kinds of dimer chains appearing on the Ge(001) and Si(001)
surfaces with adatoms of the group-IV elements are systematically interpreted
in terms of the surface stain.",2007-01-22T13:22:46Z
"Correlating anomalies of the microwave sky: The Good, the Evil and the
  Axis","At the largest angular scales the presence of a number of unexpected features
has been confirmed by the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). Among them are the anomalous alignment of the quadrupole and
octopole with each other as well as the stubborn lack of angular correlation on
scales >60deg. We search for correlations between these two phenomena and
demonstrate their absence. A Monte Carlo likelihood analysis confirms previous
studies and shows that the joint likelihood of both anomalies is incompatible
with the best-fit Lambda Cold Dark Matter model at >99.95% C.L. At the same
time, a presumed special axis (the `Axis of Evil') identified on the microwave
sky demands additional contributions to multipole power on top of the
primordial standard inflationary ones. We find that the notion of a preferred
axis in the CMB is misleading and inconsistent with three-year data from the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Rather the data require a
preferred plane, whereupon the axis is just the normal direction to that plane.
Rotational symmetry within that plane is inconsistent with the observations and
is ruled out at high confidence.",2007-03-12T14:55:53Z
"Nearly-one-dimensional self-attractive Bose-Einstein condensates in
  optical lattices","Within the framework of the mean-field description, we investigate atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), with attraction between atoms, under the
action of strong transverse confinement and periodic (optical-lattice, OL)
axial potential. Using a combination of the variational approximation (VA),
one-dimensional (1D) nonpolynomial Schr\""{o}dinger equation (NPSE), and direct
numerical solutions of the underlying 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), we
show that the ground state of the condensate is a soliton belonging to the
semi-infinite bandgap of the periodic potential. The soliton may be confined to
a single cell of the lattice, or extend to several cells, depending on the
effective self-attraction strength, $g$ (which is proportional to the number of
atoms bound in the soliton), and depth of the potential, $V_{0}$, the increase
of $V_{0}$ leading to strong compression of the soliton. We demonstrate that
the OL is an effective tool to control the soliton's shape. It is found that,
due to the 3D character of the underlying setting, the ground-state soliton
collapses at a critical value of the strength, $g=g_{c}$, which gradually
decreases with the increase of the depth of the periodic potential, $V_{0}$;
under typical experimental conditions, the corresponding maximum number of
$^{7}$Li atoms in the soliton, $N_{\max}$, ranges between $8,000$ and $4,000$.
Examples of stable multi-peaked solitons are also found in the first finite
bandgap of the lattice spectrum. The respective critical value $g_{c}$ again
slowly decreases with the increase of $V_{0}$, corresponding to $N_{\max
}\simeq 5,000$.",2007-02-06T18:12:22Z
Transmission eigenchannels from non-equilibrium Green's functions,"The concept of transmission eigenchannels is described in a tight-binding
nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) framework. A simple procedure for
calculating the eigenchannels is derived using only the properties of the
device subspace and quantities normally available in a NEGF calculation. The
method is exemplified by visualization in real-space of the eigenchannels for
three different molecular and atomic-wires.",2007-02-13T10:34:18Z
Nonequilibrium resonant spectroscopy of molecular vibrons,"Quantum transport through single molecules is essentially affected by
molecular vibrations. We investigate the behavior of the prototype single-level
model with intermediate electron-vibron coupling and arbitrary coupling to the
leads. We have developed a theory which allows to explore this regime via the
nonequilibrium Green function formalism. We show that the nonequilibrium
resonant spectroscopy is able to determine the energies of molecular orbitals
and the spectrum of molecular vibrations. Our results are relevant to scanning
tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and demonstrate the importance of the
systematic and self-consistent investigation of the effects of the vibronic
dynamics onto the transport through single molecules.",2007-01-04T20:10:58Z

  p-wave superconductor","A class of topological excitations -- the odd-winding-number vortices -- in a
spinless 2D chiral p-wave $(p_x+ip_y)$ superconductor trap Majorana fermion
states in the vortex cores. For a dilute gas of such vortices, the lowest
energy \textit{fermionic} eigenstates are intrinsically non-local. We predict
two testable signatures of this unusual quantum non-locality in quasiparticle

phenomenon does not imply the violation of causality.",2007-03-27T16:25:11Z
"Level-occupation switching of the Quantum Dot, and phase anomalies in
  mesoscopic interferometry","For a variety of quantum dots, the widths of different single-particle levels
may naturally differ by orders of magnitude. In particular, the width of one
strongly coupled level may be larger than the spacing between other, very
narrow, levels. We found that in this case many consecutive Coulomb blockade
peaks are due to occupation of the same broad level. Between the peaks the
electron jumps from this level to one of the narrow levels and the transmission
through the dot at the next resonance essentially repeats that at the previous
one. This offers a natural explanation of the salient features of the behavior
of the transmission phase in an interferometer with a QD. The theory of this
effect will be reviewed with special emphasis on the role of the interactions.
New results on the dot-charging measurements and the fine structure of
occupation switchings will be presented, accompanied by the unified description
of the whole series of CB peaks caused by a single broad level. We then discuss
the case where the system approaches the Kondo regime.",2007-03-11T11:23:09Z
"Towards an exact treatment of exchange and correlation in materials:
  Application to the ""CO adsorption puzzle"" and other systems","It is shown that the errors of present-day exchange-correlation (xc)
functionals are rather short ranged. For extended systems the correction can
therefore be evaluated by analyzing properly chosen clusters and employing
highest-quality quantum chemistry methods. The xc correction rapidly approaches
a universal dependence with cluster size. The method is applicable to bulk
systems as well as to defects in the bulk and at surfaces. It is demonstrated
here for CO adsorption at transition-metal surfaces, where present-day xc
functionals dramatically fail to predict the correct adsorption site, and for
the crystal bulk cohesive energy.",2007-03-13T22:35:15Z
Phase Diagram of Interacting Bosons on the Honeycomb Lattice,"We study the ground state properties of repulsively interacting bosons on the
honeycomb lattice using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the
hard-core limit the half-filled system develops long ranged diagonal order for
sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor repulsion. This staggered solid melts at a
first order quantum phase transition into the superfluid phase, without the
presence of any intermediate supersolid phase. Within the superfluid phase,
both the superfluid density and the compressibility exhibit local minima near
particle- (hole-) density one quarter, while the density and the condensate
fraction show inflection points in this region. Relaxing the hard-core
constraint, supersolid phases emerge for soft-core bosons. The suppression of
the superfluid density is found to persist for sufficiently large, finite
on-site repulsion.",2007-01-15T17:34:44Z
Electrical switching of vortex core in a magnetic disk,"A magnetic vortex is a curling magnetic structure realized in a ferromagnetic
disk, which is a promising candidate of a memory cell for future nonvolatile
data storage devices. Thus, understanding of the stability and dynamical
behaviour of the magnetic vortex is a major requirement for developing magnetic
data storage technology. Since the experimental proof of the existence of a
nanometre-scale core with out-of-plane magnetisation in the magnetic vortex,
the dynamics of a vortex has been investigated intensively. However, the way to
electrically control the core magnetisation, which is a key for constructing a
vortex core memory, has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate the electrical
switching of the core magnetisation by utilizing the current-driven resonant
dynamics of the vortex; the core switching is triggered by a strong dynamic
field which is produced locally by a rotational core motion at a high speed of
several hundred m/s. Efficient switching of the vortex core without magnetic
field application is achieved thanks to resonance. This opens up the
potentiality of a simple magnetic disk as a building block for spintronic
devices like a memory cell where the bit data is stored as the direction of the
nanometre-scale core magnetisation.",2007-02-26T09:39:48Z
"Physics of the Pseudogap II: Dynamics, Incompressibility, and Fermi Arcs

superconductors is presented. The crucial property of incompressibility towards
the addition of net vorticity, leading to the marked nonlinearity of the
response functions, is justified from first principles. We also discuss the
Fermi Arc phenomenon of Campuzano as a consequence of the time-fluctuating
phase in the vortex fluid.",2007-01-02T21:15:38Z
"A new method of determining the initial size and Lorentz factor of
  gamma-ray burst fireballs using a thermal emission component","In recent years increasing evidence has emerged for a thermal component in
the gamma- and X-ray spectrum of the prompt emission phase in gamma-ray bursts.
The temperature and flux of the thermal component show a characteristic break
in the temporal behavior after a few seconds. We show here, that measurements
of the temperature and flux of the thermal component at early times (before the
break) allow the determination of the values of two of the least restricted
fireball model parameters: the size at the base of the flow and the outflow
bulk Lorentz factor. Relying on the thermal emission component only, this
measurement is insensitive to the inherent uncertainties of previous estimates
of the bulk motion Lorentz factor. We give specific examples of the use of this
method: for GRB970828 at redshift z=0.9578, we show that the physical size at
the base of the flow is r_0 = (2.9+-1.8)*10^8 Y_0^{-3/2} cm and the Lorentz
factor of the flow is Gamma = (305\+-28) Y_0^{1/4}, and for GRB990510 at
z=1.619, r_0=(1.7+-1.7)*10^8 Y_0^{-3/2} cm and Gamma=(384+-71) Y_0^{1/4}, where
Y = 1 Y_0 is the ratio between the total fireball energy and the energy emitted
in gamma- rays.",2007-03-28T17:12:56Z
"A Physical Mechanism Underlying the Increase of Aqueous Solubility of
  Nonpolar Compounds and the Denaturation of Proteins upon Cooling","The increase of aqueous solubility of nonpolar compounds upon cooling and the
cold denaturation of proteins are established experimental facts. Both
phenomena have been hypothesized to be related to restructuring of the hydrogen
bond network of water around small nonpolar solutes or hydrophobic amino acid
side chains. However, an underlying physical mechanism has yet to be
identified. We assume the solute particles and the monomers of a polymer
interact via a hard sphere potential. We further assume that the solvent
molecules interact via the two-scale spherically symmetric Jagla potential,
which qualitatively reproduces the anomalies of water, such as expansion on
cooling. We find that this model correctly predicts the increase in solubility
of nonpolar compounds and the swelling of polymers on cooling. Our findings are
consistent with the possibility that the presence of two length scales in the
Jagla potential--a rigid hard core and a more flexible soft core--is
responsible for both phenomena. At low temperatures, the solvent particles
prefer to remain at the soft core distance, leaving enough space for small
nonpolar solutes to enter the solvent thus increasing solubility. We support
this hypothesized mechanism by molecular dynamic simulations.",2007-01-19T19:45:18Z
The Thermodynamical Limit of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model,"A method based on the analyzis of the Majorana polynomial roots is introduced
to compute the spectrum of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in the

regions is revealed in the parameter space whereas the ground state study only
distinguishes between two phases.",2007-03-19T17:23:30Z
"Bias-dependent Contact Resistance in Rubrene Single-Crystal Field-Effect
  Transistors","We report a systematic study of the bias-dependent contact resistance in
rubrene single-crystal field-effect transistors with Ni, Co, Cu, Au, and Pt
electrodes. We show that the reproducibility in the values of contact
resistance strongly depends on the metal, ranging from a factor of two for Ni
to more than three orders of magnitude for Au. Surprisingly, FETs with Ni, Co,
and Cu contacts exhibits an unexpected reproducibility of the bias-dependent
differential conductance of the contacts, once this has been normalized to the
value measured at zero bias. This reproducibility may enable the study of
microscopic carrier injection processes into organic semiconductors.",2007-03-01T17:04:50Z
An Effective Model of Magnetoelectricity in Multiferroics $RMn_2O_5$,"An effective model is developed to explain the phase diagram and the
mechanism of magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroics, $RMn_2O_5$. We show
that the nature of magnetoelectric coupling in $RMn_2O_5$ is a coupling between
two Ising-type orders, namely, the ferroelectric order in the b axis, and the
coupled magnetic order between two frustrated antiferromagnetic chains. The
frustrated magnetic structure drives the system to a
commensurate-incommensurate phase transition, which can be understood as a
competition between a collinear or col-plane order stemming from the `order by
disorder' mechanism and a chiral symmetry order. The low energy excitation is
calculated and the effect of the external magnetic field is analyzed. Distinct
features in the electromagnon spectrums in the incommensurate phase are
predicted.",2007-03-19T15:07:41Z
Ultraslow optical waveguiding in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate,"We investigate waveguiding of ultraslow light pulses in an atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that under the conditions of off-resonant
electromagnetically induced transparency, waveguiding with a few ultraslow
modes can be realized. The number of modes that can be supported by the
condensate can be controlled by means of experimentally accessible parameters.
Propagation constants and the mode conditions are determined analytically using
a WKB analysis. Mode profiles are found numerically.",2007-01-15T08:41:20Z
Renormalization group approach to anisotropic superconductivity,"The superconducting instability of the Fermi liquid state is investigated by
considering anisotropic electron-boson couplings. Both electron-electron
interactions and anisotropic electron-boson couplings are treated with a
renormalization-group method that takes into account retardation effects.
Considering a non-interacting circular Fermi surface, we find analytical
solutions for the flow equations and derive a set of generalized Eliashberg
equations. Electron-boson couplings with different momentum dependences are
studied, and we find superconducting instabilities of the metallic state with
competition between order parameters of different symmetries. Numerical
solutions for some couplings are given to illustrate the frequency dependence
of the vertices at different coupling regimes.",2007-02-28T09:42:36Z
Frequency shift of optical phonons in doped graphene layers,"We use first-principles density-functional calculations to determine the
frequency shift of the A$'_1$-${\bf K}$ phonon (Raman D band) in monolayer
graphene, as a function of the charge doping. A detailed DFT study on the
electron-phonon coupling and the phonon line width of E$_{2g}$-${\bm \Gamma}$
and A$'_1$-${\bf K}$ phonons are also performed for graphene multi-layers.
Furthermore, we explain the experimentally observed '1/(Number of Layers)'
behaviour of the Raman G band position after including the dynamic response
treated within time dependent perturbation theory.",2007-02-27T06:54:57Z
Dimension and Relative Frequencies,"We show how to calculate the finite-state dimension (equivalently, the
finite-state compressibility) of a saturated sets $X$ consisting of {\em all}
infinite sequences $S$ over a finite alphabet $\Sigma_m$ satisfying some given
condition $P$ on the asymptotic frequencies with which various symbols from
$\Sigma_m$ appear in $S$. When the condition $P$ completely specifies an
empirical probability distribution $\pi$ over $\Sigma_m$, i.e., a limiting
frequency of occurrence for {\em every} symbol in $\Sigma_m$, it has been known
since 1949 that the Hausdorff dimension of $X$ is precisely $\CH(\pi)$, the
Shannon entropy of $\pi$, and the finite-state dimension was proven to have
this same value in 2001.
  The saturated sets were studied by Volkmann and Cajar decades ago. It got
attention again only with the recent developments in multifractal analysis by
Barreira, Saussol, Schmeling, and separately Olsen. However, the powerful
methods they used -- ergodic theory and multifractal analysis -- do not yield a
value for the finite-state (or even computable) dimension in an obvious manner.
  We give a pointwise characterization of finite-state dimensions of saturated
sets. Simultaneously, we also show that their finite-state dimension and strong
dimension coincide with their Hausdorff and packing dimension respectively,
though the techniques we use are completely elementary. Our results
automatically extend to less restrictive effective settings (e.g.,
constructive, computable, and polynomial-time dimensions).",2007-03-16T02:42:53Z
"Encoding via Gröbner bases and discrete Fourier transforms for several
  types of algebraic codes","We propose a novel encoding scheme for algebraic codes such as codes on
algebraic curves, multidimensional cyclic codes, and hyperbolic cascaded
Reed-Solomon codes and present numerical examples. We employ the recurrence
from the Gr\""obner basis of the locator ideal for a set of rational points and
the two-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier transform. We generalize the
functioning of the generator polynomial for Reed-Solomon codes and develop
systematic encoding for various algebraic codes.",2007-03-22T04:52:35Z
"Field-induced level crossings in spin clusters: Thermodynamics and
  magneto-elastic instability","Quantum spin clusters with dominant antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange
interactions typically exhibit a sequence of field-induced level crossings in
the ground state as function of magnetic field. For fields near a level
crossing, the cluster can be approximated by a two-level Hamiltonian at low
temperatures. Perturbations, such as magnetic anisotropy or spin-phonon
coupling, sensitively affect the behavior at the level-crossing points. The
general two-level Hamiltonian of the spin system is derived in first-order
perturbation theory, and the thermodynamic functions magnetization, magnetic
torque, and magnetic specific heat are calculated. Then a magneto-elastic
coupling is introduced and the effective two-level Hamilitonian for the
spin-lattice system derived in the adiabatic approximation of the phonons. At
the level crossings the system becomes unconditionally unstable against lattice
distortions due to the effects of magnetic anisotropy. The resultant
magneto-elastic instabilities at the level crossings are discussed, as well as
the magnetic behavior.",2007-03-28T07:04:08Z
The theory of pulsar winds and nebulae,"We review current theoretical ideas on pulsar winds and their surrounding
nebulae. Relativistic MHD models of the wind of the aligned rotator, and of the
striped wind, together with models of magnetic dissipation are discussed. It is
shown that the observational signature of this dissipation is likely to be
point-like, rather than extended, and that pulsed emission may be produced. The
possible pulse shapes and polarisation properties are described. Particle
acceleration at the termination shock of the wind is discussed, and it is
argued that two distinct mechanisms must be operating, with the first-order
Fermi mechanism producing the high-energy electrons (above 1 TeV) and either
magnetic annihilation or resonant absorption of ion cyclotron waves responsible
for the 100 MeV to 1 TeV electrons. Finally, MHD models of the morphology of
the nebula are discussed and compared with observation.",2007-03-06T14:17:32Z
"Dithiocarbamate Anchoring in Molecular Wire Junctions: A First
  Principles Study","Recent experimental realization [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 127 (2005) 7328] of
various dithiocarbamate self assembly on gold surface opens the possibility for
use of dithiocarbamate linkers to anchor molecular wires to gold electrodes.
  In this paper, we explore this hypothesis computationally. We computed the
electron transport properties of 4,4'-bipyridine (BP),
4,4'-bipyridinium-1,1'-bis(carbodithioate) (BPBC),
  4-(4'-pyridyl)-peridium-1-carbodithioate (BPC) molecule junctions based on
the density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's functions. We
demonstrated that the stronger molecule-electrode coupling associated with the
conjugated dithiocarbamate linker broadens transmission resonances near the
Fermi energy. The broadening effect along with the extension of the $\pi$
conjugation from the molecule to the gold electrodes lead to enhanced
electrical conductance for BPBC molecule. The conductance enhancement factor is
as large as 25 at applied voltage bias 1.0 V.
  Rectification behavior is predicted for BPC molecular wire junction, which
has the asymmetric anchoring groups.",2007-02-27T01:58:34Z
"Novel dynamical effects and glassy response in strongly correlated
  electronic system","We find an unconventional nucleation of low temperature paramagnetic metal
(PMM) phase with monoclinic structure from the matrix of high-temperature
antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI) phase with tetragonal structure in strongly
correlated electronic system $BaCo_{0.9}Ni_{0.1}S_{1.97}$. Such unconventional
nucleation leads to a decease in resistivity by several orders with relaxation
at a fixed temperature without external perturbation. The novel dynamical
process could arise from the competition of strain fields, Coulomb
interactions, magnetic correlations and disorders. Such competition may
frustrate the nucleation, giving rise to a slow, nonexponential relaxation and
""physical aging"" behavior.",2007-03-25T13:37:12Z

"Molecular Hydrogen Formation on Amorphous Silicates Under Interstellar
  Conditions","Experimental results on the formation of molecular hydrogen on amorphous
silicate surfaces are presented for the first time and analyzed using a rate
equation model. The energy barriers for the relevant diffusion and desorption
processes are obtained. They turn out to be significantly higher than those
obtained earlier for polycrystalline silicates, demonstrating the importance of
grain morphology. Using these barriers we evaluate the efficiency of molecular
hydrogen formation on amorphous silicate grains under interstellar conditions.
It is found that unlike polycrystalline silicates, amorphous silicate grains
are efficient catalysts of H$_{2}$ formation within a temperature range which
is relevant to diffuse interstellar clouds. The results also indicate that the
hydrogen molecules are thermalized with the surface and desorb with low kinetic
energy. Thus, they are unlikely to occupy highly excited states.",2007-03-11T14:04:50Z
Decoherence Dynamics in Low-Dimensional Cold Atom Interferometers,"We report on a study of the dynamics of decoherence of a matter-wave
interferometer, consisting of a pair of low-dimensional cold atom condensates
at finite temperature. We identify two distinct regimes in the time dependence
of the coherence factor of the interferometer: quantum and classical. Explicit
analytical results are obtained in both regimes. In particular, in the
two-dimensional (2D) case in the classical (long time) regime, we find that the
dynamics of decoherence is universal, exhibiting a power-law decay with an
exponent, proportional to the ratio of the temperature to the
Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature of a single 2D condensate. In the
one-dimensional (1D) case in the classical regime we find a universal
nonanalytic time dependence of decoherence, which is a consequence of the
nonhydrodynamic nature of damping in 1D liquids.",2007-01-03T21:00:24Z
"Application of the Hilbert-Huang Transform to the Search for
  Gravitational Waves","We present the application of a novel method of time-series analysis, the
Hilbert-Huang Transform, to the search for gravitational waves. This algorithm
is adaptive and does not impose a basis set on the data, and thus the
time-frequency decomposition it provides is not limited by time-frequency
uncertainty spreading. Because of its high time-frequency resolution it has
important applications to both signal detection and instrumental
characterization. Applications to the data analysis of the ground and space
based gravitational wave detectors, LIGO and LISA, are described.",2007-01-27T16:10:31Z
"Wireless Lan to Support Multimedia Communication Using Spread Spectrum
  Technology","Wireless LAN is currently enjoying rapid deployment in University
departments, business offices, hospitals and homes. It becomes an inexpensive
technology and allows multiple numbers of the households to simultaneously
access the internet while roaming about the house. In the present work, the
design and development of a wireless LAN is highlighted which utilizes direct
sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technology at 900MHz RF carrier frequency in
its physical layer. This provides enormous security in the physical layer and
hence it is very difficult to hack or jam the network. The installation cost is
also less due to the use of 900 MHz RF carrier frequency..",2007-03-22T11:07:45Z
"Magnetization dynamics in the single-molecule magnet Fe8 under pulsed
  microwave irradiation","We present measurements on the single molecule magnet Fe8 in the presence of
pulsed microwave radiation at 118 GHz. The spin dynamics is studied via time
resolved magnetization experiments using a Hall probe magnetometer. We
investigate the relaxation behavior of magnetization after the microwave pulse.
The analysis of the experimental data is performed in terms of different
contributions to the magnetization after-pulse relaxation. We find that the
phonon bottleneck with a characteristic relaxation time of 10 to 100 ms
strongly affects the magnetization dynamics. In addition, the spatial effect of
spin diffusion is evidenced by using samples of different sizes and different
ways of the sample's irradiation with microwaves.",2007-01-15T09:49:41Z
"Adhesive contact of a compliant sphere to an elastic coated substrate:
  the thin film limit","Experimental results for adhesive contacts on substrates coated with
elastomeric thin films have recently been obtained by C. Tardivat and L.
L\'{e}ger (J. Adhesion Sci. Technol. 15 1055-1078 (2001)) by the so-called JKR
test, which provides both adhesion energy and elastic modulus. These data show
that on substrates coated with thin films the adhesion and effective elastic
modulus of the sphere depend upon the film thickness. In keeping with the
experimental conditions, we try to interpret these data using a simple model
(E. Barthel and A. Perriot, J. Phys. D 40, 1059-1067 (2007)) in the thin film
limit, ie when the film thickness is small compared to the contact radius.
Although the film does impact the local crack tip stress field, we show that no
effect on the macroscopic contact variables is expected for the adhesion to
coated substrates in such confined geometries. The deviations from the
experimental results are ascribed to the idealized contact boundary conditions
assumed in the model.",2007-03-23T12:50:32Z
"Exchange energy and generalized polarization in the presence of
  spin-orbit coupling in two dimensions","We discuss a general form of the exchange energy for a homogeneous system of
interacting electrons in two spatial dimensions which is particularly suited in
the presence of a generic spin-orbit interaction. The theory is best formulated
in terms of a generalized fractional electronic polarization. Remarkably we
find that a net generalized polarization does not necessarily translate into an
increase in the magnitude of the exchange energy, a fact that in turn favors
unpolarized states. Our results account qualitatively for the findings of
recent experimental investigations.",2007-01-15T21:49:45Z
"BrlAPI: Simple, Portable, Concurrent, Application-level Control of
  Braille Terminals","Screen readers can drive braille devices for allowing visually impaired users
to access computer environments, by providing them the same information as
sighted users. But in some cases, this view is not easy to use on a braille
device. In such cases, it would be much more useful to let applications provide
their own braille feedback, specially adapted to visually impaired users. Such
applications would then need the ability to output braille ; however, allowing
both screen readers and applications access a wide panel of braille devices is
not a trivial task. We present an abstraction layer that applications may use
to communicate with braille devices. They do not need to deal with the
specificities of each device, but can do so if necessary. We show how several
applications can communicate with one braille device concurrently, with BrlAPI
making sensible choices about which application eventually gets access to the
device. The description of a widely used implementation of BrlAPI is included.",2007-03-09T16:55:23Z
"Lanczos potentials and a definition of gravitational entropy for
  perturbed FLRW space-times","We give a prescription for constructing a Lanczos potential for a
cosmological model which is a purely gravitational perturbation of a
Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker space-time. For the radiation equation of
state, we find the Lanczos potential explicitly via Fourier transforms. As an
application, we follow up a suggestion of Penrose and propose a definition of
gravitational entropy for these cosmologies. With this definition, the
gravitational entropy initially is finite if and only if the initial Weyl
tensor is finite.",2007-02-09T20:44:08Z
"Detectability of Occultation of Stars by Objects in the Kuiper Belt and
  Oort Cloud","The serendipitous detection of stellar occultations by Outer Solar System
objects is a powerful method for ascertaining the small end ($r \lesssim 15$
km) of the size distribution of Kuiper Belt Objects and may potentially allow
the exploration of objects as far out as the Oort Cloud. The design and
implementation of an occultation survey is aided by a detailed understanding of
how diffraction and observational parameters affect the detection of
occultation events. In this study, stellar occultations are simulated,
accounting for diffraction effects, finite source sizes, finite bandwidths,
stellar spectra, sampling, and signal-to-noise. Finally, the possibility of
detecting small Outer Solar System objects from the Kuiper Belt all the way out
to the Oort Cloud is explored for three photometric systems: a proposed space
telescope, Whipple (Kaplan et al. 2003), the Taiwanese-American Occultation
Survey (Lehner et al. 2006), and the Multi Mirror Telescope (Bianco 2007).",2007-03-19T15:51:52Z

"A Framework for Designing MIMO systems with Decision Feedback
  Equalization or Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding","We consider joint transceiver design for general Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output communication systems that implement interference
(pre-)subtraction, such as those based on Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE)
or Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). We develop a unified framework for
joint transceiver design by considering design criteria that are expressed as
functions of the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the individual data streams. By
deriving two inequalities that involve the logarithms of the individual MSEs,
we obtain optimal designs for two classes of communication objectives, namely
those that are Schur-convex and Schur-concave functions of these logarithms.
For Schur-convex objectives, the optimal design results in data streams with
equal MSEs. This design simultaneously minimizes the total MSE and maximizes
the mutual information for the DFE-based model. For Schur-concave objectives,
the optimal DFE design results in linear equalization and the optimal THP
design results in linear precoding. The proposed framework embraces a wide
range of design objectives and can be regarded as a counterpart of the existing
framework of linear transceiver design.",2007-01-26T02:20:33Z
"Superlattice Magnetophonon Resonances in Strongly Coupled InAs/GaSb
  Superlattices","We report an experimental study of miniband magnetoconduction in
semiconducting InAs/GaSb superlattices. For samples with miniband widths below
the longitudinal optical phonon energy we identify a new superlattice
magnetophonon resonance (SLMPR) caused by resonant scattering of electrons
across the mini-Brillouin zone. This new resonant feature arises directly from
the drift velocity characteristics of the superlattice dispersion and total
magnetic quantisation of the superlattice Landau level minibands.",2007-01-10T17:10:02Z
"Magnetic field induced spin-flop transition in Na$_x$CoO$_2$
  (0.5$<$x$<$0.55)","The isothermal magnetoresistance (MR) with magnetic field (H) parallel to and
perpendicular to ab plane is systematically studied on the single crystal
Na$_{0.52}$CoO$_2$ with charge ordering at $\sim 50$ K and an in-plane
ferromagnetism below 25 K. The isothermal MR behavior with H $\parallel$ ab
plane and H $\perp$ ab plane is quite different. When H $\parallel$ ab plane,
the MR is always negative and the in-plane ferromagnetic behavior is enhanced.
While the MR with H $\perp$ ab plane changes from negative to positive with
decreasing temperature or increasing H, and the in-plane ferromagnetic behavior
is suppressed. A striking feature is that the MR with H $\perp$ ab plane shows
a hysteresis behavior below 25 K, which is absent for the case of H $\parallel$
ab plane. These results provide strong evidence for a spin-flop transition of
small moments of Co$^{3.5-\delta}$ sites induced by H $\perp$ ab plane, leading
to a metamagnetic transition for small moments of Co$^{3.5-\delta}$ sites.
These complex magnetism suggests an unconventional superconductivity in
Na$_x$CoO$_2$ system because the Na$_x$CoO$_2$ around x=0.5 is considered to be
the parent compound of superconductivity.",2007-03-25T09:02:45Z
Temperature Hysteresis of Magnetization in Lanthanum Manganite,"We propose an explanation for the experimentally observed temperature
hysteresis of magnetization in single crystals of lanthanum manganite
(La0.8Sr0.2MnO3). The phenomenon is interpreted within the framework of a
double-exchange model with allowance for the interaction of the magnetic
subsystem with a bistable mode of the tilting-rotational oscillations in the
correlated sublattice of MnO6 octahedra.",2007-02-20T11:44:40Z
"The route of frustrated cuprates from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic
  spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains: Li2ZrCuO4 as a missing link near the quantum
  critical point","From thermodynamics, LSDA+U calculations and exact diagonalization studies of
a five-band Hubbard (Cu 3d, O 2p) model on CuO2 stripes we found that Li2ZrCuO4
(Li2CuZrO4 in traditional notation) is close to a ferromagnetic critical point.
Analyzing its measured susceptibility chi(T) and specific heat cp(T,H) within a
Heisenberg model, we show that the ratio of the 2nd to the 1st neighbor
exchange integrals alpha=-J2/J1 of the order of 0.3, i.e. it is close to the
critical value alpha_c=1/4. Comparing with related chain cuprates we explain
the rather strong field dependence of cp, the monotonous down shift of the peak
of chi(T), and its increase for alpha approaching 1/4 + 0.",2007-01-30T11:14:06Z
Rigid unit modes in tetrahedral crystals,"The 'rigid unit mode' (RUM) model requires unit blocks, in our case
tetrahedra of SiO_4 groups, to be rigid within first order of the displacements
of the O-ions. The wave-vectors of the lattice vibrations, which obey this
rigidity, are determined analytically. Lattices with inversion symmetry yield
generically surfaces of RUMs in reciprocal space, whereas lattices without this
symmetry yield generically lines of RUMs. Only in exceptional cases as in
beta-quartz a surface of RUMs appears, if inversion symmetry is lacking. The
occurence of planes and bending surfaces, straight and bent lines is discussed.
Explicit calculations are performed for five modifications of SiO_2 crystals.",2007-03-19T14:11:27Z
Non-periodic pseudo-random numbers used in Monte Carlo calculations,"The generation of pseudo-random numbers is one of the interesting problems in
Monte Carlo simulations, mostly because the common computer generators produce
periodic numbers. We used simple pseudo-random numbers generated with the
simplest chaotic system, the logistic map, with excellent results. The numbers
generated in this way are non-periodic, which we demonstrated for 10$^{13}$
numbers, and they are obtained in a deterministic way, which allows to repeat
systematically any calculation. The Monte Carlo calculations are the ideal
field to apply these numbers, and we did it for simple and more elaborated
cases. Chemistry and Information Technology use this kind of simulations, and
the application of this numbers to Quantum Monte Carlo and Cryptography is
immediate. I present here the techniques to calculate, analyze and use these
pseudo-random numbers, show that they lack periodicity up to 10$^{13}$ numbers
and that they are not correlated.",2007-01-05T11:45:26Z
"Resonance Fluorescence in Transport through Quantum Dots: Noise

a time-dependent ac field and develope a method that allows us to extract
simultaneously the full counting statistics of the electronic tunneling and

that the quantum noise of both the transmitted electrons and the emitted

the driving field intensity or the bias voltage.",2007-03-05T15:48:21Z
Spin blockade at semiconductor/ferromagnet junctions,"We study theoretically extraction of spin-polarized electrons at nonmagnetic
semiconductor/ferromagnet junctions. The outflow of majority spin electrons
from the semiconductor into the ferromagnet leaves a cloud of minority spin
electrons in the semiconductor region near the junction, forming a local
spin-dipole configuration at the semiconductor/ferromagnet interface. This
minority spin cloud can limit the majority spin current through the junction
creating a pronounced spin-blockade at a critical current. We calculate the
critical spin-blockade current in both planar and cylindrical geometries and
discuss possible experimental tests of our predictions.",2007-01-27T04:46:03Z
Attribute Value Weighting in K-Modes Clustering,"In this paper, the traditional k-modes clustering algorithm is extended by
weighting attribute value matches in dissimilarity computation. The use of
attribute value weighting technique makes it possible to generate clusters with
stronger intra-similarities, and therefore achieve better clustering
performance. Experimental results on real life datasets show that these value
weighting based k-modes algorithms are superior to the standard k-modes
algorithm with respect to clustering accuracy.",2007-01-03T09:06:03Z
Magnetotransport and thermoelectricity in disordered graphene,"We have studied the electric and thermal response of two-dimensional
Dirac-fermions in a quantizing magnetic field in the presence of localized
disorder. The electric and heat current operators in the presence of magnetic
field are derived. The self-energy due to impurities is calculated
self-consistently, and depends strongly on the frequency and field strength,
resulting in asymmetric peaks in the density of states at the Landau level
energies, and small islands connecting them. The Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations
remain periodic in 1/B, in spite of the distinct quantization of quasiparticle
orbits compared to normal metals. The Seebeck coefficient depends strongly on
the field strength and orientation. For finite field and chemical potential,
the Wiedemann-Franz law can be violated.",2007-01-29T15:25:17Z
Single-site Anderson model. II Perturbation theory of symmetric model,"The strong electron correlations caused by Coulomb interaction of impurity
electrons are taken into account. The infinite series of diagrams containing
irreducible Green's functions are summed. For symmetric Anderson model we
establish the antisymmetry property of the impurity Green's function, formulate
the exact Dyson type equation for it, find the approximate correlation function
$Z_{\sigma}(i\omega $) and solve the integral equation which determines the
full propagator of the impurity electrons. Analytical continuation of the
obtained Matsubara Green's function determines the retarded one and gives the
possibility to find the spectral function of impurity electrons. The existence
of two resonances of this function has been proved. The smooth behaviour was
found near the Fermi surface. The two resonances situated symmetrical to the
Fermi surface correspond to the energies of quantum transitions of the impurity
electrons. The widths and heights of these resonances are established.",2007-01-13T17:30:03Z
"Vortices, antivortices and superfluid shells separating Mott-insulating
  regions","Atomic or molecular bosons in harmonically confined optical lattices exhibit
a wedding cake structure consisting of insulating (Mott) shells. It is shown
that superfluid regions emerge between Mott shells as a result of fluctuations
due to finite hopping. It is found that the order parameter equation in the
superfluid region is not of the Gross-Pitaeviskii type except near the
insulator to superfluid boundaries. The excitation spectra in the Mott and
superfluid regions are obtained, and it is shown that the superfluid shells
posses low energy sound modes with spatially dependent sound velocity described
by a local index of refraction directly related to the local superfluid
density. Lastly, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and
vortex-antivortex pairs are discussed in thin (wide) superfluid shells (rings)
limited by three (two) dimensional Mott regions.",2007-02-06T19:02:20Z
"Tunneling into a Fractional Quantum Hall System and the Infrared
  Catastrophe","We calculate the tunneling density of states of a two-dimensional interacting
electron gas in a quantizing magnetic field. We show that the observed
pseudogap in the density of states can be understood as the result of an
infrared catastrophe in a noninteracting electron model. This catastrophe stems
from the response of an electronic system to the potential produced by the
abruptly added charge during a tunneling event. Our formalism can be applied at
any filling factor without the use of Chern-Simons or composite fermion theory.",2007-02-09T11:27:53Z
"Low temperature behaviour and glass line of the symmetrical colloidal
  electrolyte","We report on the low temperature behaviour of the colloidal electrolyte by
means of Molecular Dynamics simulations, where the electrostatic interactions
were modeled using effective screened interactions. As in previous works, we
have found a region of gas-liquid coexistence located in the low $T$- low
$\rho$ region. At temperatures much lower than the critical one, the system
cannot reach equilibrium, that is, the gas-liquid transition is arrested. Two
different mechanisms have been identified to cause arrest: gelation in the
lowest $T$ and crowding at intermediate $T$ values, the latter associated with
the crossing point between the binodal and the glass line. To test the latter,
the dynamics of the colloidal electrolyte near this crossing point has been
computed and compared to the universal predictions of the ideal MCT. As in
other glass-forming liquids, we found good agreement between this mean field
theory and the dynamics of this complex system, although it fails just at the
transition. Interestingly, in this region we found that the dynamics of this
system is driven mainly by the steric interactions, showing all the typical
properties of a repulsive colloidal glass. Finally, the isodiffusivity lines
show that in this system with short range attractions, there is no re-entrant
glass phenomenon, as opposed to monocomponent systems.",2007-01-17T18:50:21Z
The resonance peak in the electron-doped cuprate superconductors,"We study the emergence of a magnetic resonance in the superconducting state
of the electron-doped cuprate superconductors. We show that the recently
observed resonance peak in the electron-doped superconductor
Pr$_{0.88}$LaCe$_{0.12}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ is consistent with an overdamped spin
exciton located near the particle-hole continuum. We present predictions for
the magnetic-field dependence of the resonance mode as well as its temperature
evolution in those parts of the phase diagram where $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave
superconductivity may coexist with an antiferromagnetic spin-density wave.",2007-02-15T21:02:14Z
"Spin dynamics across the superfluid-insulator transition of spinful
  bosons","Bosons with non-zero spin exhibit a rich variety of superfluid and insulating
phases. Most phases support coherent spin oscillations, which have been the
focus of numerous recent experiments. These spin oscillations are Rabi
oscillations between discrete levels deep in the insulator, while deep in the
superfluid they can be oscillations in the orientation of a spinful condensate.
We describe the evolution of spin oscillations across the superfluid-insulator
quantum phase transition. For transitions with an order parameter carrying
spin, the damping of such oscillations is determined by the scaling dimension
of the composite spin operator. For transitions with a spinless order parameter
and gapped spin excitations, we demonstrate that the damping is determined by
an associated quantum impurity problem of a localized spin excitation
interacting with the bulk critical modes. We present a renormalization group
analysis of the quantum impurity problem, and discuss the relationship of our
results to experiments on ultracold atoms in optical lattices.",2007-03-01T16:41:47Z
Evolution of Collisionally Merged Massive Stars,"We investigate the evolution of collisionally merged stars with mass of ~100
MSun which might be formed in dense star clusters. We assumed that massive
stars with several tens Msun collide typically after ~1Myr of the formation of
the cluster and performed hydrodynamical simulations of several collision
events. Our simulations show that after the collisions, merged stars have
extended envelopes and their radii are larger than those in the thermal
equilibrium states and that their interiors are He-rich because of the stellar
evolution of the progenitor stars. We also found that if the mass-ratio of
merging stars is far from unity, the interior of the merger product is not well
mixed and the elemental abundance is not homogeneous. We then followed the
evolution of these collision products by a one dimensional stellar evolution
code. After an initial contraction on the Kelvin-Helmholtz (thermal adjustment)
timescale (~1000-10000 yr), the evolution of the merged stars traces that of
single homogeneous stars with corresponding masses and abundances, while the
initial contraction phase shows variations which depend on the mass ratio of
the merged stars. We infer that, once runaway collisions have set in,
subsequent collisions of the merged stars take place before mass loss by
stellar winds becomes significant. Hence, stellar mass loss does not inhibit
the formation of massive stars with mass of ~1000Msun.",2007-03-13T01:22:45Z
39-K Bose-Einstein condensate with tunable interactions,"We produce a Bose-Einstein condensate of 39-K atoms. Condensation of this
species with naturally small and negative scattering length is achieved by a
combination of sympathetic cooling with 87-Rb and direct evaporation,
exploiting the magnetic tuning of both inter- and intra-species interactions at
Feshbach resonances. We explore tunability of the self-interactions by studying
the expansion and the stability of the condensate. We find that a 39-K
condensate is interesting for future experiments requiring a weakly interacting
Bose gas.",2007-03-27T13:22:51Z
Metabasin dynamics and local structure in supercooled water,"We employ the Distance Matrix method to investigate metabasin dynamics in
supercooled water. We find that the motion of the system consists in the
exploration of a finite region of configuration space (enclosing several
distinct local minima), named metabasin, followed by a sharp crossing to a
different metabasin. The characteristic time between metabasin transitions is
comparable to the structural relaxation time, suggesting that these transitions
are relevant for the long time dynamics. The crossing between metabasins is
accompanied by very rapid diffusional jumps of several groups of dynamically
correlated particles. These particles form relatively compact clusters and act
as cooperative relaxing units responsible for the density relaxation. We find
that these mobile particles are often characterized by an average coordination
larger than four, i.e. are located in regions where the tetrahedral hydrogen
bond network is distorted.",2007-02-06T10:01:19Z
"Vanishing Integral Relations and Expectation Values for Bloch Functions
  in Finite Domains","Integral identities for particular Bloch functions in finite periodic systems
are derived. All following statements are proven for a finite domain consisting
of an integer number of unit cells. It is shown that matrix elements of
particular Bloch functions with respect to periodic differential operators
vanish identically. The real valuedness, the time-independence and a summation
property of the expectation values of periodic differential operators applied
to superpositions of specific Bloch functions are derived.",2007-03-28T13:35:26Z
New results at 3PN via an effective field theory of gravity,"NRGR, an Effective Field Theory approach to gravity, has emerged as a
powerful tool to systematically compute higher order corrections in the
Post-Newtonian expansion. Here we discuss in somehow more detail the recently
reported new results for the spin-spin gravitational potential at third
Post-Newtonian order.",2007-01-18T18:48:17Z
"Some remarks on Rényi relative entropy in a thermostatistical
  framework","In ordinary Boltzmann-Gibbs thermostatistics, the relative entropy expression
plays the role of generalized free energy, providing the difference between the
off-equilibrium and equilibrium free energy terms associated with
Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. In this context, we studied whether this physical
meaning can be given to R\'{e}nyi relative entropy definition found in the
literature from a generalized thermostatistical point of view. We find that
this is possible only in the limit as $q$ approaches to 1. This shows that
R\'{e}nyi relative entropy has a physical (thermostatistical) meaning only when
the system can already be explained by ordinary Boltzmann-Gibbs
thermostatistics. Moreover, this can be taken as an indication of R\'{e}nyi
entropy being an equilibrium entropy since any relative entropy definition is a
two-probability generalization of the associated entropy definition. We also
note that this result is independent of the internal energy constraint
employed. Finally, we comment on the lack of foundation of R\'{e}nyi relative
entropy as far as its minimization (which is equivalent to the maximization of
R\'{e}nyi entropy) is considered in order to obtain a stationary equilibrium
distribution since R\'{e}nyi relative entropy does not conform to Shore-Johnson
axioms.",2007-03-01T01:28:57Z
"Signatures of Discontinuity in the Exchange-Correlation Energy
  Functional Derived from the Subband Electronic Structure of Semiconductor
  Quantum Wells","The discontinuous character of the exact exchange-correlation $(xc)$ energy
functional of Density Functional Theory is shown to arise naturally in the
subband spectra of semiconductor quantum wells. Using an \emph{ab-initio} $xc$
functional, including exchange exactly and correlation in an exact partial way,
a discontinuity appears in the $xc$ potential, each time a subband becomes
slightly occupied. Exchange and correlation give opposite contributions to the
discontinuity, with correlation overcoming exchange. The jump in the
intersubband energy is in excellent agreement with experimental data.",2007-02-07T19:49:29Z
"Elementary events of electron transfer in a voltage-driven quantum point
  contact","We show that the statistics of electron transfer in a coherent quantum point
contact driven by an arbitrary time-dependent voltage is composed of elementary
events of two kinds: unidirectional one-electron transfers determining the
average current and bidirectional two-electron processes contributing to the
noise only. This result pertains at vanishing temperature while the extended
Keldysh-Green's function formalism in use also enables the systematic
calculation of the higher-order current correlators at finite temperatures.",2007-01-12T16:47:17Z
"Fluctuation and gauge effects on the critical behavior of
  superconductors","Gauge effects on the fluctuation properties of the normal-to-superconducting
phase transition in bulk and thin film superconductors are reviewed. Similar
problems in the description of other natural systems (liquid crystals, quantum
field theory, early universe) are also discussed. The relatively strong gauge
effects on the fluctuations of the ordering field at low spatial dimensionality
$D$ and, in particular, in thin (quasi-2D) films are considered in details. A
special attention is paid to the fluctuations of the gauge field. It is shown
that the mechanism, in which these gauge fluctuations affect the phase
transition order and other phase transition properties varies with the
variation of spatial dimensionality $D$. The problem for the experimental
confirmation of theoretical predictions about the order of phase transitions in
gauge systems is discussed. Related topics: gauge effects on the critical
behavior of unconventional superconductors, disorder, quantum fluctuations in a
close vicinity of ultra-low phase transition temperatures, are also briefly
discussed.",2007-01-12T09:52:45Z
"Correlations and entanglements in a few-electron quantum dot without
  Zeeman splitting","We explore the correlations and entanglements of exact-diagonalized
few-electron wave functions in a quantum dot in magnetic fields without the
Zeeman splitting. With the increase of the field, the lowest states with
different spins gradually form a narrow band and the electronic states undergo
a transition from liquids to rotating Wigner molecules which are accompanied by
different characters of charge correlations. For both the liquid and crystal
states, the spin conditional probability densities show magnetic couplings
between the particles which depend on the particle numbers, the total spins and
the angular momenta of the states. The von Neumann entropies show the
spin-dependent entanglements between electrons. The regular magnetic-coupling
oscillations and converging entanglement entropies emerge in the rotating
Wigner molecular states.",2007-01-10T03:09:04Z
Paramagnon-induced dispersion anomalies in the cuprates,"We report the self-energy associated with RPA magnetic susceptibility in the
hole-doped Bi_2Sr_2CuO_6 (Bi2201) and the electron-doped Nd_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_4
(NCCO) in the overdoped regime within the framework of a one-band Hubbard
model. Strong weight is found in the magnetic spectrum around (pi, 0) at about
360 meV in Bi2201 and 640 meV in NCCO, which yields dispersion anomalies in
accord with the recently observed `waterfall' effects in the cuprates.",2007-01-22T16:40:36Z
A Coding Theorem for a Class of Stationary Channels with Feedback,"A coding theorem is proved for a class of stationary channels with feedback
in which the output Y_n = f(X_{n-m}^n, Z_{n-m}^n) is the function of the
current and past m symbols from the channel input X_n and the stationary
ergodic channel noise Z_n. In particular, it is shown that the feedback
capacity is equal to $$ \limp_{n\to\infty} \sup_{p(x^n||y^{n-1})} \frac{1}{n}
I(X^n \to Y^n), $$ where I(X^n \to Y^n) = \sum_{i=1}^n I(X^i; Y_i|Y^{i-1})
denotes the Massey directed information from the channel input to the output,
and the supremum is taken over all causally conditioned distributions
p(x^n||y^{n-1}) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|x^{i-1},y^{i-1}). The main ideas of the
proof are the Shannon strategy for coding with side information and a new
elementary coding technique for the given channel model without feedback, which
is in a sense dual to Gallager's lossy coding of stationary ergodic sources. A
similar approach gives a simple alternative proof of coding theorems for finite
state channels by Yang-Kavcic-Tatikonda, Chen-Berger, and
Permuter-Weissman-Goldsmith.",2007-01-07T11:42:23Z
"Frequency Response of the Mechanochemically Synthesized AgI-Ag2O-B2O3
  Superionic Glasses","The synthesis of xAgI(1-x)[Ag2O.B2O3] amorphous superionic conductors is done
via mechanochemical synthesis route (for x = 0.5 and 0.7). Ionic conductivities
of 3 mOhm-1cm-1 for x = 0.5 sample and 5mOhm-1cm-1 for x = 0.7 sample at room
temperature, are observed, which are higher than those of the melt quenched
glassy samples. Impedance plots (Nyquist plots) are found to be depressed
semicircles with a tail at low frequency end. The corresponding equivalent
circuit is postulated and each circuit element is related to a physical
process. The ac conductivity is analyzed in view of the universal dynamic
response (Bode Plots). A unique feature of the mechnochemically synthesized
glasses is that their dc conductivity vs. 1/T behavior exhibit two distinct
regions with different activation energies. The activation energy for dc
conductivity (Edc) and that for ac conductivity (Eac) and the frequency
exponent n are found to satisfy the UDR-relation, Eac= (1-n)Edc in the lower
temperature regime. In the high temperature region, however, this correlation
could not be established due to lack of sac data over the available frequency
domain.",2007-03-20T19:22:00Z
"Probability currents as principal characteristics in the statistical
  mechanics of non-equilibrium steady states","One of the key features of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) is the
presence of nontrivial probability currents. We propose a general
classification of NESS in which these currents play a central distinguishing
role. As a corollary, we specify the transformations of the dynamic transition
rates which leave a given NESS invariant. The formalism is most transparent
within a continuous time master equation framework since it allows for a
general graph-theoretical representation of the NESS. We discuss the
consequences of these transformations for entropy production, present several
simple examples, and explore some generalizations, to discrete time and
continuous variables.",2007-01-31T01:15:42Z
Charge orderings in the atomic limit of the extended Hubbard model,"The extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit (AL-EHM) on a square lattice
with periodic boundary conditions is studied with use of the Monte Carlo (MC)
method. Within the grand canonical ensemble the phase and order-order
boundaries for charge orderings are obtained. The phase diagrams include three
types of charge ordered phases and the nonordered phase. The system exhibits
very rich structure and shows unusual multicritical behavior. In the limiting
case of tij = 0, the EHM is equivalent to the pseudospin model with single-ion
anisotropy 1/2U, exchange interaction W in an effective magnetic field
(mu-1/2U-zW). This classical spin model is analyzed using the MC method for the
canonical ensemble. The phase diagram is compared with the known results for
the Blume-Capel model.",2007-03-19T09:50:10Z
Exciton-exciton scattering: Composite boson versus elementary boson,"This paper introduces a new quantum object, the ``coboson'', for composite
particles, like the excitons, which are made of two fermions. Although commonly
dealed with as elementary bosons, these composite bosons -- ``cobosons'' in
short -- differ from them due to their composite nature which makes the
handling of their many-body effects quite different from the existing
treatments valid for elementary bosons. Due to this composite nature, it is not
possible to correctly describe the interaction between cobosons as a potential
$V$. Consequently, the standard Fermi golden rule, written in terms of $V$,
cannot be used to obtain the transition rates between exciton states. Through
an unconventional expression for this Fermi golden rule, which is here given in
terms of the Hamiltonian only, we here give a detailed calculation of the time
evolution of two excitons. We compare the results of this exact approach with
the ones obtained by using an effective bosonic exciton Hamiltonian. We show
that the relation between the inverse lifetime and the sum of transition rates
for elementary bosons differs from the one of composite bosons by a factor of
1/2, whatever the mapping from composite bosons to elementary bosons is. The
present paper thus constitutes a strong mathematical proof that, in spite of a
widely spread belief, we cannot forget the composite nature of these cobosons,
even in the extremely low density limit of just two excitons. This paper also
shows the (unexpected) cancellation, in the Born approximation, of the
two-exciton transition rate for a finite value of the momentum transfer.",2007-02-12T15:01:03Z
"Self-organization of supercooled liquids confined inside nano-porous
  materials","Large scale molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the
structural and dynamical modifications of supercooled water when confined
inside an hydrophilic nanopore. We then investigate the evolution of the
auto-organization of the most and the least mobile molecules (dynamical
heterogeneity and string-like cooperative motions) when supercooled water is
confined. Our calculations use the recent TIP5P intermolecular potential for
water. We observe a strong slowing down of the dynamical properties when the
liquid is confined, although the liquid structure is found to remain unchanged
when corrected from the pore geometry. We then study cooperative motions inside
supercooled confined water in comparison with bulk water. We observe strong
modifications of the cooperative motions when the liquid is confined. We
observe that dynamical heterogeneities and the associated correlation lengths
are strongly increased as well as string-like motions in the confined liquid.
This result, which is in opposition with the expected limitation of the
correlation length by the confinement procedure, may explain (or be explained
by) the slowing down of the dynamics. However the comparison of the dynamical
heterogeneities at constant diffusion coefficient shows that the slowing down
of the dynamics is not sufficient to explain the increase of the correlation
lengths.",2007-02-23T17:32:02Z
A note on using finite non-abelian $p$-groups in the MOR cryptosystem,"The MOR cryptosystem is a natural generalization of the El-Gamal cryptosystem
to non-abelian groups. Using a $p$-group, a cryptosystem was built by this
author in 'A simple generalization of El-Gamal cryptosystem to non-abelian
groups'. It seems reasonable to assume the cryptosystem is as secure as the
El-Gamal cryptosystem over finite fields. A natural question arises can one
make a better cryptosystem using $p$-groups? In this paper we show that the
answer is no.",2007-02-16T19:04:32Z
"Effects of correlated disorder on the magnetism of double exchange
  systems","We study the effects of short-range correlated disorder arising from chemical
dopants or local lattice distortions, on the ferromagnetism of 3d double
exchange systems. For this, we integrate out the carriers and treat the
resulting disordered spin Hamiltonian within local random phase approximation,
whose reliability is shown by direct comparison with Monte Carlo simulations.
We find large scale inhomogeneities in the charge, couplings and spin
densities. Compared with the homogeneous case, we obtain larger Curie
temperatures ($T_{C}$) and very small spin stiffnesses ($D$). As a result,
large variations of $\frac{D}{T_{C}}$ measured in manganites may be explained
by correlated disorder. This work also provides a microscopic model for
Griffiths phases in double exchange systems.",2007-02-27T14:07:09Z
Molecular Doping of Graphene,"Graphene, a one-atom thick zero gap semiconductor [1, 2], has been attracting
an increasing interest due to its remarkable physical properties ranging from
an electron spectrum resembling relativistic dynamics [3-12] to ballistic
transport under ambient conditions [1-4]. The latter makes graphene a promising
material for future electronics and the recently demonstrated possibility of
chemical doping without significant change in mobility has improved graphene's
prospects further [13]. However, to find optimal dopants and, more generally,
to progress towards graphene-based electronics requires understanding the
physical mechanism behind the chemical doping, which has been lacking so far.
Here, we present the first joint experimental and theoretical investigation of
adsorbates on graphene. We elucidate a general relation between the doping
strength and whether or not adsorbates have a magnetic moment: The paramagnetic
single NO2 molecule is found to be a strong acceptor, whereas its diamagnetic
dimer N2O4 causes only weak doping. This effect is related to the peculiar
density of states of graphene, which provides an ideal situation for model
studies of doping effects in semiconductors. Furthermore, we explain recent
results on its ""chemical sensor"" properties, in particular, the possibility to
detect a single NO2 molecule [13].",2007-03-15T04:27:47Z
Current sharing between superconducting film and normal metal,"A two-dimensional model is introduced that describes current sharing between
the superconducting and normal metal layers in configuration typical of
YBCO-coated conductors. The model is used to compare the effectiveness of
surround stabilizer and more conventional one-sided stabilizer. When the
resistance of the interface between the superconductor and stabilizer is low
enough, the surround stabilizer is less effective than the one-sided stabilizer
in stabilizing a hairline crack in the superconducting film.",2007-03-07T19:48:15Z
"Enskog Theory for Polydisperse Granular Mixtures II. Sonine Polynomial
  Approximation","The linear integral equations defining the Navier-Stokes (NS) transport
coefficients for polydisperse granular mixtures of smooth inelastic hard disks
or spheres are solved by using the leading terms in a Sonine polynomial
expansion. Explicit expressions for all the NS transport coefficients are given
in terms of the sizes, masses, compositions, density and restitution
coefficients. In addition, the cooling rate is also evaluated to first order in
the gradients. The results hold for arbitrary degree of inelasticity and are
not limited to specific values of the parameters of the mixture. Finally, a
detailed comparison between the derivation of the current theory and previous
theories for mixtures is made, with attention paid to the implication of the
various treatments employed to date.",2007-02-05T16:42:00Z
"Imaging transverse electron focusing in semiconducting heterostructures
  with spin-orbit coupling","Transverse electron focusing in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) with
strong spin-orbit coupling is revisited. The transverse focusing is related to
the transmission between two contacts at the edge of a 2DEG when a
perpendicular magnetic field is applied. Scanning probe microscopy imaging
techniques can be used to study the electron flow in these systems. Using
numerical techniques we simulate the images that could be obtained in such
experiments. We show that hybrid edge states can be imaged and that the
outgoing flux can be polarized if the microscope tip probe is placed in
specific positions.",2007-03-10T20:08:20Z
"The Influence of Electro-Mechanical Effects on Resonant Electron
  Tunneling Through Small Carbon Nano-Peapods","The influence of a fullerene molecule trapped inside a single-wall carbon
nanotube on resonant electron transport at low temperatures and strong
polaronic coupling is theoretically discussed. Strong peak to peak fluctuations
and anomalous temperature behavior of conductance amplitudes are predicted and
investigated. The influence of the chiral properties of carbon nanotubes on
transport is also studied.",2007-02-06T17:32:02Z
"Jitter radiation as a possible mechanism for Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows.
  Spectra and lightcurves","The standard model of GRB afterglows assumes that the radiation observed as a
delayed emission is of synchrotron origin, which requires the shock magnetic
field to be relatively homogeneous on small scales. An alternative mechanism --
jitter radiation, which traditionally has been applied to the prompt emission
-- substitutes synchrotron when the magnetic field is tangled on a microscopic
scale. Such fields are produced at relativistic shocks by the Weibel
instability. Here we explore the possibility that small-scale fields populate
afterglow shocks. We derive the spectrum of jitter radiation under the
afterglow conditions. We also derive the afterglow lightcurves for the ISM and
Wind profiles of the ambient density. Jitter self-absorption is calculated here
for the first time. We find that jitter radiation can produce afterglows
similar to synchrotron-generated ones, but with some important differences. We
compare the predictions of the two emission mechanisms. By fitting
observational data to the synchrotron and jitter afterglow lightcurves, it can
be possible to discriminate between the small-scale vs large-scale magnetic
field models in afterglow shocks.",2007-03-09T11:04:47Z
"Transition from a two-dimensional superfluid to a one-dimensional Mott
  insulator","A two-dimensional system of atoms in an anisotropic optical lattice is
studied theoretically. If the system is finite in one direction, it is shown to
exhibit a transition between a two-dimensional superfluid and a one-dimensional
Mott insulating chain of superfluid tubes. Monte Carlo simulations are
consistent with the expectation that the phase transition is of
Kosterlitz-Thouless type. The effect of the transition on experimental
time-of-flight images is discussed.",2007-01-25T14:29:28Z
Fidelity and quantum phase transitions,"It is shown that the fidelity, a basic notion of quantum information science,
may be used to characterize quantum phase transitions, regardless of what type
of internal order is present in quantum many-body states. If the fidelity of
two given states vanishes, then there are two cases: (1) they are in the same
phase if the distinguishability results from irrelevant local information; or
(2) they are in different phases if the distinguishability results from
relevant long-distance information. The different effects of irrelevant and
relevant information are quantified, which allows us to identify unstable and
stable fixed points (in the sense of renormalization group theory). A physical
implication of our results is the occurrence of the orthogonality catastrophe
near the transition points.",2007-01-25T01:21:13Z
Preparation and manipulation of a fault-tolerant superconducting qubit,"We describe a qubit encoded in continuous quantum variables of an rf
superconducting quantum interference device. Since the number of accessible
states in the system is infinite, we may protect its two-dimensional subspace
from small errors introduced by the interaction with the environment and during
manipulations. We show how to prepare the fault-tolerant state and manipulate
the system. The discussed operations suffice to perform quantum computation on
the encoded state, syndrome extraction, and quantum error correction. We also
comment on the physical sources of errors and possible imperfections while
manipulating the system.",2007-01-19T02:48:45Z
Different facets of the raise and peel model,"The raise and peel model is a one-dimensional stochastic model of a
fluctuating interface with nonlocal interactions. This is an interesting
physical model. It's phase diagram has a massive phase and a gapless phase with
varying critical exponents. At the phase transition point, the model exhibits
conformal invariance which is a space-time symmetry. Also at this point the
model has several other facets which are the connections to associative
algebras, two-dimensional fully packed loop models and combinatorics.",2007-03-27T19:08:40Z
"Accurate quadratic-response approximation for the self-consistent
  pseudopotential of semiconductor nanostructures","Quadratic-response theory is shown to provide a conceptually simple but
accurate approximation for the self-consistent one-electron potential of
semiconductor nanostructures. Numerical examples are presented for GaAs/AlAs
and InGaAs/InP (001) superlattices using the local-density approximation to
density-functional theory and norm-conserving pseudopotentials without
spin-orbit coupling. When the reference crystal is chosen to be the
virtual-crystal average of the two bulk constituents, the absolute error in the
quadratic-response potential for Gamma(15) valence electrons is about 2 meV for
GaAs/AlAs and 5 meV for InGaAs/InP. Low-order multipole expansions of the
electron density and potential response are shown to be accurate throughout a
small neighborhood of each reciprocal lattice vector, thus providing a further
simplification that is confirmed to be valid for slowly varying envelope
functions. Although the linear response is about an order of magnitude larger
than the quadratic response, the quadratic terms are important both
quantitatively (if an accuracy of better than a few tens of meV is desired) and
qualitatively (due to their different symmetry and long-range dipole effects).",2007-03-27T07:04:30Z
A transition from river networks to scale-free networks,"A spatial network is constructed on a two dimensional space where the nodes
are geometrical points located at randomly distributed positions which are
labeled sequentially in increasing order of one of their co-ordinates. Starting
with $N$ such points the network is grown by including them one by one
according to the serial number into the growing network. The $t$-th point is
attached to the $i$-th node of the network using the probability: $\pi_i(t)
\sim k_i(t)\ell_{ti}^{\alpha}$ where $k_i(t)$ is the degree of the $i$-th node
and $\ell_{ti}$ is the Euclidean distance between the points $t$ and $i$. Here
$\alpha$ is a continuously tunable parameter and while for $\alpha=0$ one gets
the simple Barab\'asi-Albert network, the case for $\alpha \to -\infty$
corresponds to the spatially continuous version of the well known Scheidegger's
river network problem. The modulating parameter $\alpha$ is tuned to study the
transition between the two different critical behaviors at a specific value
$\alpha_c$ which we numerically estimate to be -2.",2007-01-11T14:17:28Z
Peltier effects in Andreev interferometers,"The superconducting proximity effect is known to modify transport properties
of hybrid normal--superconducting structures. In addition to changing
electrical and thermal transport separately, it alters the thermoelectric
effects. Changes to one off-diagonal element $L_{12}$ of the thermoelectric
matrix $L$ have previously been studied via the thermopower, but the remaining
coefficient $L_{21}$ which is responsible for the Peltier effect has received
less attention. We discuss symmetry relations between $L_{21}$ and $L_{12}$ in
addition to the Onsager reciprocity, and calculate Peltier coefficients for a
specific structure. Similarly as for the thermopower, for finite phase
differences of the superconducting order parameter, the proximity effect
creates a Peltier effect significantly larger than the one present in purely
normal-metal structures. This results from the fact that a nonequilibrium
supercurrent carries energy.",2007-03-13T07:36:00Z
"Statistical mechanics of coil-hairpin transition in a single stranded
  DNA oligomer","A model of self-avoiding walk with suitable constraints on self-attraction is
developed to describe the conformational behavior of a short RNA or a single
stranded DNA molecule that forms hairpin structure and calculate the properties
associated with coil-hairpin transition by enumerating all possible
conformations of a chain of N monomers in two and three dimensions. The first
and last five monomers of the chain have been allowed to pair and form the stem
of the hairpin structure while the remaining monomers can form a loop. The
coil-hairpin transition is found to be first order with large entropy change.
While the rate of unzipping of the hairpin stem is found to be independent of
the length of the loop and the dimensionality of the space, the rate of closing
varies greatly with loop length and dimensionality of the space.",2007-01-16T09:58:57Z
"Aspect-Ratio Scaling of Domain Wall Entropy for the 2D $\pm J$ Ising
  Spin Glass","The ground state entropy of the 2D Ising spin glass with +1 and -1 bonds is
studied for $L \times M$ square lattices with $L \le M$ and $p$ = 0.5, where
$p$ is the fraction of negative bonds, using periodic and/or antiperiodic
boundary conditions. From this we obtain the domain wall entropy as a function
of $L$ and $M$. It is found that for domain walls which run in the short, $L$
direction, there are finite-size scaling functions which depend on the ratio $M
/ L^{d_S}$, where $d_S = 1.22 \pm 0.01$. When $M$ is larger than $L$, very
different scaling forms are found for odd $L$ and even $L$. For the zero-energy
domain walls, which occur when $L$ is even, the probability distribution of
domain wall entropy becomes highly singular, and apparently multifractal, as $M
/ L^{d_S}$ becomes large.",2007-03-06T00:53:25Z
"Impact of astrophysical processes on the gamma-ray background from dark
  matter annihilations","We study the impact of astrophysical processes on the gamma-ray background
produced by the annihilation of dark matter particles in cosmological halos,
with particular attention to the consequences of the formation of supermassive
black holes. In scenarios where these objects form adiabatically from the
accretion of matter on small seeds, dark matter is first compressed into very
dense ``spikes'', then its density progressively decreases due to annihilations
and scattering off of stellar cusps. With respect to previous analyses, based
on non-evolving halos, the predicted annihilation signal is higher and
significantly distorted at low energies, reflecting the large contribution to
the total flux from unevolved spikes at high redshifts. The peculiar spectral
feature arising from the specific redshift distribution of the signal, would
discriminate the proposed scenario from more conventional astrophysical
explanations. We discuss how this affects the prospects for detection and
demonstrate that the gamma-ray background from DM annihilations might be
detectable even in absence of a signal from the Galactic center.",2007-03-09T23:21:18Z
Non-Repudiation in Internet Telephony,"We present a concept to achieve non-repudiation for natural language
conversations over the Internet. The method rests on chained electronic
signatures applied to pieces of packet-based, digital, voice communication. It
establishes the integrity and authenticity of the bidirectional data stream and
its temporal sequence and thus the security context of a conversation. The
concept is close to the protocols for Voice over the Internet (VoIP), provides
a high level of inherent security, and extends naturally to multilateral
non-repudiation, e.g., for conferences. Signatures over conversations can
become true declarations of will in analogy to electronically signed, digital
documents. This enables binding verbal contracts, in principle between
unacquainted speakers, and in particular without witnesses. A reference
implementation of a secure VoIP archive is exhibited.",2007-01-23T15:23:21Z
Entrainment transition in populations of random frequency oscillators,"The entrainment transition of coupled random frequency oscillators is
revisited. The Kuramoto model (global coupling) is shown to exhibit unusual
sample-dependent finite size effects leading to a correlation size exponent
$\bar\nu=5/2$. Simulations of locally coupled oscillators in $d$-dimensions
reveal two types of frequency entrainment: mean-field behavior at $d>4$, and
aggregation of compact synchronized domains in three and four dimensions. In
the latter case, scaling arguments yield a correlation length exponent
$\nu=2/(d-2)$, in good agreement with numerical results.",2007-01-26T11:19:31Z
"Crossover from normal (N) Ohmic subdivision to superconducting (S)
  equipartition of current in parallel conductors at the N-S transition: Theory","The recently observed (1) equipartition of current in parallel at and below
the Normal-Superconducting (N-S) transition can be understood in terms of a
Landau-Ginzburg order-parameter phenomenology. This complements the explanation
proposed earlier (1) based on the flux-flow resistance providing a nonlinear
negative current feedback towards equipartition when the transition is
approached from above. The present treatment also unifies the usual textbook
inductive subdivision expected much below T_c, and the equipartition as T_c is
approached from below. The question of metastability is also briefly discussed.",2007-02-07T08:29:30Z
Swift Observations of the Cooling Accretion Disk of XTE J1817-330,"The black hole candidate X-ray transient XTE J1817-330 was observed by the
Swift satellite over 160 days of its 2006 outburst with the XRT and UVOT
instruments. At the start of the observations, the XRT spectra show that the
0.6-10 keV emission is dominated by an optically thick, geometrically thin
accretion disk with an inner disk temperature of $\sim0.8$ keV, indicating that
the source was in a high/soft state during the initial outburst phase. We
tracked the source through its decline into the low/hard state with the
accretion disk cooling to $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{keV}$ and the inner disk radius
consistent with the innermost stable circular orbit at all times. Furthermore,
the X-ray luminosity roughly follows $L_X \propto T^4$ during the decline,
consistent with a geometrically stable blackbody. These results are the
strongest evidence yet obtained that accretion disks do not automatically
recede after a state transition, down to accretion rates as low as $0.001
L_{Edd}$. Meanwhile, the near-UV flux does not track the X-ray disk flux, and
is well in excess of what is predicted if the near-UV emission is from viscous
dissipation in the outer disk. The strong correlation between the hard X-ray
flux and the near-UV flux, which scale as $L_X^{0.5}$, indicate that
reprocessed emission is most likely the dominate contribution to the near-UV
flux. We discuss our results within the context of accretion disks and the
overall accretion flow geometry in accreting black holes.",2007-03-19T17:01:19Z
"Direct Measurement of the Spin-Orbit Interaction in a Two-Electron InAs
  Nanowire Quantum Dot","We demonstrate control of the electron number down to the last electron in
tunable few-electron quantum dots defined in catalytically grown InAs
nanowires. Using low temperature transport spectroscopy in the Coulomb blockade
regime we propose a simple method to directly determine the magnitude of the
spin-orbit interaction in a two-electron artificial atom with strong spin-orbit
coupling. Due to a large effective g-factor |g*|=8+/-1 the transition from
singlet S to triplet T+ groundstate with increasing magnetic field is dominated
by the Zeeman energy rather than by orbital effects. We find that the
spin-orbit coupling mixes the T+ and S states and thus induces an avoided
crossing with magnitude $\Delta_{SO}$=0.25+/-0.05 meV. This allows us to
calculate the spin-orbit length $\lambda_{SO}\approx$127 nm in such systems
using a simple model.",2007-01-09T04:11:29Z
Phase-ordering kinetics on graphs,"We study numerically the phase-ordering kinetics following a temperature
quench of the Ising model with single spin flip dynamics on a class of graphs,
including geometrical fractals and random fractals, such as the percolation
cluster. For each structure we discuss the scaling properties and compute the
dynamical exponents. We show that the exponent $a_\chi$ for the integrated
response function, at variance with all the other exponents, is independent on
temperature and on the presence of pinning. This universal character suggests a
strict relation between $a_\chi$ and the topological properties of the
networks, in analogy to what observed on regular lattices.",2007-02-06T15:31:02Z
"Coupled spin-charge drift-diffusion approach for a two-dimensional
  electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling","Based on kinetic equations for the density matrix, drift-diffusion equations
are derived for a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.
Universal results are obtained for the weak coupling case. Most interesting is
the observation that with increasing spin-orbit coupling strengths there is a
sharp transition between spin diffusion and ballistic spin transport. For
strong spin-orbit coupling, when the elastic scattering time is much larger
than the spin relaxation time, undamped spin-coherent waves are identified. The
existence of these long-lived spin-coherent states is confirmed by exact
analytical results obtained from microscopic kinetic equations valid in the
ballistic regime.",2007-01-31T15:13:47Z
"Decoherence of Rabi oscillations of electronic spin states in a double

oscillations between spin states |$\uparrow \downarrow$>, |$\downarrow

of fluctuations in energy and in the quantum state of the system, both in the
classical and quantum limit. The role of state fluctuations is shown to be of
leading order at sufficiently high temperature, applicable to actual
experiments. At low temperature the low frequency energy fluctuations are the
only dominant contribution.",2007-03-13T16:52:11Z
"Graphene: new bridge between condensed matter physics and quantum
  electrodynamics","Graphene is the first example of truly two-dimensional crystals - it's just
one layer of carbon atoms. It turns out to be a gapless semiconductor with
unique electronic properties resulting from the fact that charge carriers in
graphene demonstrate charge-conjugation symmetry between electrons and holes
and possess an internal degree of freedom similar to ``chirality'' for
ultrarelativistic elementary particles. It provides unexpected bridge between
condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics (QED). In particular, the
relativistic Zitterbewegung leads to the minimum conductivity of order of
conductance quantum $e^2/h$ in the limit of zero doping; the concept of Klein
paradox (tunneling of relativistic particles) provides an essential insight
into electron propagation through potential barriers; vacuum polarization
around charge impurities is essential for understanding of high electron
mobility in graphene; index theorem explains anomalous quantum Hall effect.",2007-03-14T15:23:44Z
Spatial Coherence of a Polariton Condensate,"We perform Young's double-slit experiment to study the spatial coherence
properties of a two-dimensional dynamic condensate of semiconductor microcavity
polaritons. The coherence length of the system is measured as a function of the
pump rate, which confirms a spontaneous buildup of macroscopic coherence in the
condensed phase. An independent measurement reveals that the position and
momentum uncertainty product of the condensate is close to the Heisenberg
limit. An experimental realization of such a minimum uncertainty wave packet of
the polariton condensate opens a door to coherent matter-wave phenomena such as
Josephson oscillation, superfluidity, and solitons in solid state condensate
systems.",2007-03-20T07:45:08Z
STM observation of initial growth of Sn atoms on Ge(001) surface,"We have studied initial growth of Sn atoms on Ge(001) surfaces at room
temperature and 80 K by scanning tunneling microscopy. For Sn deposition onto
the Ge(001) substrate at room temperature, the Sn atoms form two kinds of
one-dimensional structures composed of ad-dimers with different alignment, in
the <310> and the <110> directions, and epitaxial structures. For Sn deposition
onto the substrate at 80 K, the population of the dimer chains aligning in the
<310> direction increases. The diffusion barrier of the Sn adatom on the
substrate kinetically determines the population of the dimer chain. We propose
that the diffusion barrier height depends on surface strain induced by the
adatom. The two kinds of dimer chains appearing on the Ge(001) and Si(001)
surfaces with adatoms of the group-IV elements are systematically interpreted
in terms of the surface stain.",2007-01-22T13:22:46Z
Spin blockade at semiconductor/ferromagnet junctions,"We study theoretically extraction of spin-polarized electrons at nonmagnetic
semiconductor/ferromagnet junctions. The outflow of majority spin electrons
from the semiconductor into the ferromagnet leaves a cloud of minority spin
electrons in the semiconductor region near the junction, forming a local
spin-dipole configuration at the semiconductor/ferromagnet interface. This
minority spin cloud can limit the majority spin current through the junction
creating a pronounced spin-blockade at a critical current. We calculate the
critical spin-blockade current in both planar and cylindrical geometries and
discuss possible experimental tests of our predictions.",2007-01-27T04:46:03Z
Anomalous spin-dependent behaviour of one-dimensional subbands,"We report a new electron interaction effect in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wires.
Using DC-bias spectroscopy, we show that large and abrupt changes occur to the
energies of spin-down (lower energy) states as they populate. The effect is not
observed for spin-up energy states. At B=0, interactions have a pronounced
effect, in the form of the well-known 0.7 Structure. However, our new results
show that interactions strongly affect the energy spectrum at all magnetic
fields, from 0 to 16T, not just in the vicinity of the 0.7 Structure.",2007-02-07T15:33:49Z
Spin dynamics in a superconductor / ferromagnet proximity system,"The ferromagnetic resonance of thin sputtered Ni80Fe20 films grown on Nb is
measured. By varying the temperature and thickness of the Nb the role of the
superconductivity on the whole ferromagnetic layer in these heterostructures is
explored. The change in the spin transport properties below the superconducting
transition of the Nb is found to manifest itself in the Ni80Fe20 layer by a
sharpening in the resonance of the ferromagnet, or a decrease in the effective
Gilbert damping co-efficient. This dynamic proximity effect is in contrast to
low frequency studies in these systems, where the effect of the superconductor
is confined to a small region in the ferromagnet. We interpret this in terms of
the spin pumping model.",2007-02-20T14:07:50Z
"Nonequilibrium charge dynamics of light-driven rings threaded by a
  magnetic flux","We study theoretically the charge polarization and the charge current
dynamics of a mesoscopic ring driven by short asymmetric electromagnetic pulses
and threaded by an external static magnetic flux. It is shown that the
pulse-induced charge polarization and the associated light-emission is
controllable by tuning the external magnetic flux. Applying two mutually
perpendicular pulses triggers a charge current in the ring. The interplay
between this nonequilibrium and the persistent currents is investigated and the
conditions under which the pulses stop the persistent current are identified.",2007-03-19T22:56:42Z
H-H dipole interactions in fcc metals,"It is observed that interstitial hydrogen nucleii on a metallic lattice are
strongly coupled to their near neighbours by the unscreened electromagnetic
field mediating transitions between low-lying states. It is shown that the
dominant interaction is of dipole-dipole character. By means of numerical
calculations based upon published data, it is then shown that in stoichiometric
PdD, in which essentially all interstitial sites are occupied by a deuteron,
certain specific superpositions of many-site product states exist that are
lower in energy than the single-site ground state, suggesting the existence of
a new low temperature phase. Finally, the modified behaviour of the
two-particle wavefunction at small separations is investigated and prelimary
results suggesting a radical narrowing of the effective Coulomb barrier are
presented.",2007-03-27T14:47:21Z
Black Hole Shadow Image and Visibility Analysis of Sagittarius A*,"The compact dark objects with very large masses residing at the centres of
galaxies are believed to be black holes. Due to the gravitational lensing
effect, they would cast a shadow larger than their horizon size over the
background, whose shape and size can be calculated. For the supermassive black
hole candidate Sgr A*, this shadow spans an angular size of about 50 micro arc
second, which is under the resolution attainable with the current astronomical
instruments. Such a shadow image of Sgr A* will be observable at about 1 mm
wavelength, considering the scatter broadening by the interstellar medium. By
simulating the black hole shadow image of Sgr A* with the radiatively
inefficient accretion flow model, we demonstrate that analyzing the properties
of the visibility function can help us determine some parameters of the black
hole configuration, which is instructive to the sub-millimeter VLBI
observations of Sgr A* in the near future.",2007-03-12T06:23:20Z
The Fundamental Theorems of Interval Analysis,"Expressions are not functions. Confusing the two concepts or failing to

interval analysis.

The frequency of planets in multiple systems,"The frequency of planets in binaries is an important issue in the field of
extrasolar planet studies, because of its relevance in estimating of the global
planet population of our Galaxy and the clues it can give to our understanding
of planet formation and evolution. However, only preliminary estimates are
available in the literature. We analyze and compare the frequency of planets in
multiple systems to the frequency of planets orbiting single stars. We also try
to highlight possible connections between the frequency of planets and the
orbital parameters of the binaries (such as the periastron and mass ratio.) A
literature search was performed for binaries and multiple systems among the
stars of the sample with uniform planet detectability defined by Fischer &
Valenti (2005), and 202 of the 850 stars of the sample turned out to be
binaries, allowing a statistical comparison of the frequency of planets in
binaries and single stars and a study of the run of the planet frequency as a
function of the binary separation. We found that the global frequency of
planets in the binaries of the sample is not statistically different from that
of planets in single stars. Even conservatively taking the probable
incompleteness of binary detection in our sample into account, we estimate that
the frequency of planets in binaries can be no more than a factor of three
lower than that of planets in single stars. There is no significant dependence
of planet frequency on the binary separation, except for a lower value of
frequency for close binaries. However, this is probably not as low as required
to explain the presence of planets in close binaries only as the result of
modifications of the binary orbit after the planet formation.",2007-03-29T13:27:16Z
Enhanced triplet superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric systems,"We study pairing symmetry of noncentrosymmetric superconductors based on the
extended Hubbard model on square lattice near half-filling, using the random
phase approximation. We show that d+f-wave pairing is favored and the triplet
f-wave state is enhanced by Rashba type spin-orbit coupling originating from
the broken inversion symmetry. The enhanced triplet superconductivity stems
from the increase of the effective interaction for the triplet pairing and the
reduction of the spin susceptibility caused by the Rashba type spin-orbit
coupling which lead to the increase of the triplet component and the
destruction of the singlet one, respectively.",2007-03-30T10:09:08Z
"Transport Properties of Multiple Quantum Dots Arranged in Parallel:
  Results from the Bethe Ansatz","In this paper we analyze transport through a double dot system connected to
two external leads. Imagining each dot possessing a single active level, we
model the system through a generalization of the Anderson model. We argue that
this model is exactly solvable when certain constraints are placed upon the dot
Coulomb charging energy, the dot-lead hybridization, and the value of the
applied gate voltage. Using this exact solvability, we access the zero
temperature linear response conductance both in and out of the presence of a
Zeeman field. We are also able to study the finite temperature linear response
conductance. We focus on universal behaviour and identify three primary
features in the transport of the dots: i) a so-called RKKY Kondo effect; ii) a
standard Kondo effect; and iii) interference phenomena leading to sharp
variations in the conductance including conductance zeros. We are able to use
the exact solvability of the dot model to characterize these phenomena
quantitatively. While here we primarily consider a double dot system, the
approach adopted applies equally well to N-dot systems.",2007-01-26T20:23:18Z
New release of the ELODIE library: Version 3.1,"We present ELODIE.3.1, an updated release of the library published in
Prugniel & Soubiran (2001, 2004). The library includes 1962 spectra of 1388
stars obtained with the ELODIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de
Haute-Provence 193cm telescope in the wavelength range 390 to 680 nm. It
provides a wide coverage of atmospheric parameters : T_eff from 3100 K to 50000
K, log g from -0.25 to 4.9 and [Fe/H] from -3 to +1. The library is given at
two resolutions: R~42000, with the flux normalized to the pseudo-continuum,
FWHM=0.55\AA (R~10000) calibrated in physical flux (reduced above earth
atmosphere) with a broad-band photometric precision of 2.5% and narrow-band
precision of 0.5%.
  In this new release the data-reduction (flux calibration, reconnection of the
echelle orders) has been improved, and in particular the blue region, between
390 and 400 nm has been added.
  The FITS files for each spectra, and the measured atmospheric parameters are
publicly available.

rf SQUID metamaterials,"An rf superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) array in an
alternating magnetic field is investigated with respect to its effective
magnetic permeability, within the effective medium approximation. This system
acts as an inherently nonlinear magnetic metamaterial, leading to negative

ARCHANGEL Galaxy Photometry System,"Photometry of galaxies has typically focused on small, faint systems due to
their interest for cosmological studies. Large angular size galaxies, on the
other hand, offer a more detailed view into the properties of galaxies, but
bring a series of computational and technical difficulties that inhibit the
general astronomer from extracting all the information found in a detailed
galaxy image. To this end, a new galaxy photometry system has been developed
(mostly building on tools and techniques that have existed in the community for
decades) that combines ease of usage with a mixture of pre-built scripts. The
audience for this system is a new user (graduate student or non-optical
astronomer) with a fast, built-in learning curve to offer any astronomer, with
imaging data, a suite of tools to quickly extract meaningful parameters from
decent data. The tools are available either by a client/server web site or by
tarball for personal installation. The tools also provide simple scripts to
interface with various on-line datasets (e.g. 2MASS, Sloan, DSS) for data
mining capability of imaged data.
  As a proof of concept, we preform a re-analysis of the 2MASS Large Galaxy
Atlas to demonstrate the differences in an automated pipeline, with its
emphasis on speed, versus this package with an emphasis on accuracy. This
comparison finds the structural parameters extracted from the 2MASS pipeline is
seriously flawed with scale lengths that are too small by 50% and central
surface brightness that are, on average, 1 to 0.5 mags too bright. A cautionary
tale on how to reduce information-rich data such as surface brightness

Multicomponent fluid of hard spheres near a wall,"The rational function approximation method, density functional theory, and

with a size ratio 1:3 in which both components occupy a similar volume are
specifically examined. The results indicate that the present version of density
functional theory yields an excellent overall performance. A reasonably
accurate behavior of the rational function approximation method is also
observed, except in the vicinity of the first minimum, where it may even
predict unphysical negative values.",2007-02-12T17:31:10Z
Succinct Sampling on Streams,"A streaming model is one where data items arrive over long period of time,
either one item at a time or in bursts. Typical tasks include computing various
statistics over a sliding window of some fixed time-horizon. What makes the
streaming model interesting is that as the time progresses, old items expire
and new ones arrive. One of the simplest and central tasks in this model is
sampling. That is, the task of maintaining up to $k$ uniformly distributed
items from a current time-window as old items expire and new ones arrive. We
call sampling algorithms {\bf succinct} if they use provably optimal (up to
constant factors) {\bf worst-case} memory to maintain $k$ items (either with or
without replacement). We stress that in many applications structures that have
{\em expected} succinct representation as the time progresses are not
sufficient, as small probability events eventually happen with probability 1.
Thus, in this paper we ask the following question: are Succinct Sampling on
Streams (or $S^3$-algorithms)possible, and if so for what models? Perhaps
somewhat surprisingly, we show that $S^3$-algorithms are possible for {\em all}
variants of the problem mentioned above, i.e. both with and without replacement
and both for one-at-a-time and bursty arrival models. Finally, we use $S^3$
algorithms to solve various problems in sliding windows model, including
frequency moments, counting triangles, entropy and density estimations. For
these problems we present \emph{first} solutions with provable worst-case
memory guarantees.",2007-02-25T17:20:48Z

Doped Mott insulator as the origin of heavy Fermion behavior in LiV2O4,"We investigate the electronic structure of LiV2O4, for which heavy fermion

local density approximation and dynamical mean field theory. To obtain results
at zero temperature, we employ the projective quantum Monte Carlo method as an
impurity solver. Our results show that the strongly correlated a1g band is a
lightly doped Mott insulator which -at low temperatures- shows a sharp (heavy)
quasiparticle peak just above the Fermi level, which is consistent with recent

"The Munich Near-Infrared Cluster Survey (MUNICS) - IX. Galaxy Evolution
  to z ~ 2 From Optically Selected Catalogues","(Abridged) We present B, R, and I-band selected galaxy catalogues based on
the Munich Near-Infrared Cluster Survey (MUNICS) which, together with the
K-selected sample, serve as an important probe of galaxy evolution in the
redshift range 0 < z < 2. Furthermore, used in comparison they are ideally
suited to study selection effects. The construction of the B, R, and I-selected
photometric catalogues, containing ~9000, ~9000, and ~6000 galaxies,
respectively, is described in detail. The catalogues reach 50% completeness
limits for point sources of B ~ 24.5mag, R ~ 23.5mag, and I ~ 22.5mag and cover
an area of about 0.3 square degrees. Photometric redshifts are derived for all
galaxies with an accuracy of dz/(1+z) ~ 0.057. We investigate the influence of
selection band and environment on the specific star formation rate (SSFR). We
find that K-band selection indeed comes close to selection in stellar mass,
while B-band selection purely selects galaxies in star formation rate. We use a
galaxy group catalogue constructed on the K-band selected MUNICS sample to
study possible differences of the SSFR between the field and the group
environment, finding a marginally lower average SSFR in groups as compared to
the field, especially at lower redshifts. The field-galaxy luminosity function
in the B and R band as derived from the R-selected sample evolves out to z ~ 2
in the sense that the characteristic luminosity increases but the number
density decreases. This effect is smaller at longer rest-frame wavelengths and
gets more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. Parametrising the redshift
evolution of the Schechter parameters as M*(z) = M*(0) + a ln(1+z) and Phi*(z)
= Phi*(0) (1+z)^b we find evolutionary parameters a ~ -2.1 and b ~ -2.5 for the

"Band-to-band tunneling in a carbon nanotube metal-oxide-semiconductor
  field-effect transistor is dominated by phonon assisted tunneling","Band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) devices have recently gained a lot of interest
due to their potential for reducing power dissipation in integrated circuits.
We have performed extensive simulations for the BTBT operation of carbon
nanotube metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (CNT-MOSFETs) using
the non-equilibrium Green's functions formalism for both ballistic and
dissipative quantum transport. In comparison with recently reported
experimental data (Y. Lu et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., v. 128, p. 3518-3519, 2006),
we have obtained strong evidence that BTBT in CNT-MOSFETs is dominated by
optical phonon assisted inelastic transport, which can have important
implications on the transistor characteristics. It is shown that under large
biasing conditions two-phonon scattering may also become important.",2007-03-19T17:53:48Z
"Detection of large magneto-anisotropy of electron spin dephasing in a
  high-mobility two-dimensional electron system in a $[001]$ GaAs/AlGaAs
  quantum well","In time-resolved Faraday rotation experiments we have detected an inplane
anisotropy of the electron spin-dephasing time (SDT) in an
$n$--modulation-doped GaAs/Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As single quantum well. The SDT
was measured with magnetic fields of $B\le 1$ T, applied in the $[110]$ and
$[1\bar{1}0]$ inplane crystal directions of the GaAs quantum well. For fields
along $[1\bar{1}0]$, we have found an up to a factor of about 2 larger SDT than
in the perpendicular direction. Fully microscopic calculations, by numerically
solving the kinetic spin Bloch equations considering the D'yakonov-Perel' and
the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanisms, reproduce the experimental findings
quantitatively. This quantitative analysis of the data allowed us to determine
the relative strengths of Rashba and Dresselhaus terms in our sample. Moreover,
we could estimate the SDT for spins aligned in the $[110]$ {\em inplane}
direction to be on the order of several nanoseconds, which is up to two orders
of magnitude larger than that in the perpendicular {\em inplane} direction.",2007-03-28T09:27:35Z
"Accurate quadratic-response approximation for the self-consistent
  pseudopotential of semiconductor nanostructures","Quadratic-response theory is shown to provide a conceptually simple but
accurate approximation for the self-consistent one-electron potential of
semiconductor nanostructures. Numerical examples are presented for GaAs/AlAs
and InGaAs/InP (001) superlattices using the local-density approximation to
density-functional theory and norm-conserving pseudopotentials without
spin-orbit coupling. When the reference crystal is chosen to be the
virtual-crystal average of the two bulk constituents, the absolute error in the
quadratic-response potential for Gamma(15) valence electrons is about 2 meV for
GaAs/AlAs and 5 meV for InGaAs/InP. Low-order multipole expansions of the
electron density and potential response are shown to be accurate throughout a
small neighborhood of each reciprocal lattice vector, thus providing a further
simplification that is confirmed to be valid for slowly varying envelope
functions. Although the linear response is about an order of magnitude larger
than the quadratic response, the quadratic terms are important both
quantitatively (if an accuracy of better than a few tens of meV is desired) and
qualitatively (due to their different symmetry and long-range dipole effects).",2007-03-27T07:04:30Z

A symmetry principle for Topological Quantum Order,"We present a unifying framework to study physical systems which exhibit
topological quantum order (TQO). The guiding principle behind our approach is
that of symmetries and entanglement. We introduce the concept of
low-dimensional Gauge-Like Symmetries (GLSs), and the physical conservation
laws (including topological terms and fractionalization) which emerge from
them. We prove then sufficient conditions for TQO at both zero and finite
temperatures. The topological defects which are associated with the restoration
of GLSs lead to TQO. Selection rules associated with the GLSs enable us to
systematically construct states with TQO; these selection rules do not rely on
the existence of a finite gap between the ground states to all other excited
states. All currently known examples of TQO display GLSs. We analyze spectral
structures and show that Kitaev's toric code model and Wen's plaquette model
are equivalent and reduce, by a duality mapping, to an Ising chain. Despite the
spectral gap in these systems, the toric operator expectation values may vanish
once thermal fluctuations are present. This mapping illustrates that the
quantum states themselves in a particular (operator language) representation
encode TQO and that the duality mappings, being non-local in the original
representation, disentangle the order. We present a general algorithm for the
construction of long-range string orders in general systems with entangled
ground states.",2007-02-16T06:44:42Z
Structure and Aggregation of a Helix-Forming Polymer,"We have studied the competition between helix formation and aggregation for a

demonstrate that proximity between two such molecules can stabilize secondary

temperatures between 80 mK and 500 mK. The aim is to determine whether there is
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) below the critical temperature, T_c = 200 mK
where a superfluid density has been observed. Assuming BEC appears as a
macroscopic occupation of the k = 0 state below T_c, we find a condensate
fraction of n_0 = (-0.10 \pm 1.20)% at T = 80 mK and n_0 = (0.08\pm0.78)% at T
= 120 mK, consistent with zero. The shape of n(k) also does not change on
crossing T_c within measurement precision.",2007-02-14T23:01:59Z
"Universal features of information spreading efficiency on
  $d$-dimensional lattices","A model for information spreading in a population of $N$ mobile agents is
extended to $d$-dimensional regular lattices. This model, already studied on
two-dimensional lattices, also takes into account the degeneration of
information as it passes from one agent to the other. Here, we find that the
structure of the underlying lattice strongly affects the time $\tau$ at which
the whole population has been reached by information. By comparing numerical
simulations with mean-field calculations, we show that dimension $d=2$ is
marginal for this problem and mean-field calculations become exact for $d > 2$.
Nevertheless, the striking nonmonotonic behavior exhibited by the final degree
of information with respect to $N$ and the lattice size $L$ appears to be
geometry independent.",2007-02-26T11:06:24Z
"Pressure Study of Superconductivity and Magnetism in Pure and Rh-Doped
  RuSr2GdCu2O8 Materials","A hydrostatic pressure study was made on pure and Rh-doped specimens of the
superconducting ferromagnetic compounds Ru1-xRhxSr2GdCu2O8 (x = 0-0.15) by
means of measurement of electrical resistivity vs temperature, in pressures up
to 2 GPa. Partial substitution of Rh for Ru decreases the magnetization of the
material, lowers both the magnetic ordering temperature Tm, and the
superconducting transition temperature Tc, and promotes granularity. The effect
of pressure for all compositions is an increase in both the intra- and
intergranular superconductivity transition temperatures, Tc and Tp
respectively, as well as Tm. The rate of change of each transition temperature
with pressure first drops for Rh concentrations near 5%, increasing latter for
higher concentrations. While the rate of increase of Tc with pressure for all
compositions is 2-3 times lower than in YBCO materials, the simultaneous
increase of Tc and Tm with pressure could support the notion of competition
between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in these materials. The effect of
pressure on the weak-links was a significant improvement of inter-granular
connectivity.",2007-01-09T19:08:03Z
Emergence of self-sustained patterns in small-world excitable media,"Motivated by recent observations that long-range connections (LRC) play a
role in various brain phenomena, we have observed two distinct dynamical
transitions in the activity of excitable media where waves propagate both
between neighboring regions and through LRC. When LRC density $p$ is low,
single or multiple spiral waves are seen to emerge and cover the entire system.
This state is self-sustaining and robust against perturbations. At $p=p_c^l$
the spirals are suppressed and there is a transition to a spatially
homogeneous, temporally periodic state. Finally, above $p=p_c^u$, activity
ceases after a brief transient.",2007-01-06T04:15:46Z
Electron states of mono- and bilayer graphene on SiC probed by STM,"We present a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of a
gently-graphitized 6H-SiC(0001) surface in ultra high vacuum. From an analysis
of atomic scale images, we identify two different kinds of terraces, which we
unambiguously attribute to mono- and bilayer graphene capping a C-rich
interface. At low temperature, both terraces show $(\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3})$
quantum interferences generated by static impurities. Such interferences are a
fingerprint of $\pi$-like states close to the Fermi level. We conclude that the
metallic states of the first graphene layer are almost unperturbed by the
underlying interface, in agreement with recent photoemission experiments (A.
Bostwick et al., Nature Physics 3, 36 (2007))",2007-02-19T14:40:24Z
"Matrix product decomposition and classical simulation of quantum
  dynamics in the presence of a symmetry","We propose a refined matrix product state representation for many-body
quantum states that are invariant under SU(2) transformations, and indicate how
to extend the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm in order to
simulate time evolution in an SU(2) invariant system. The resulting algorithm
is tested in a critical quantum spin chain and shown to be significantly more
efficient than the standard TEBD.",2007-01-18T05:04:24Z
"Triplet pairing and upper critical field in the mixed state of d-wave
  superconductors","We show that an additional triplet component of the order parameter is
generated in the vortex phase of the d-wave superconductor. Spatial variations
of the triplet component are analyzed for a strong spin-orbit coupling.
Corrections to the London equation and an unusual temperature dependence of the
upper critical field, are obtained in the case of the weak spin-orbit coupling.",2007-02-22T13:33:44Z
"Effect of temperature on quantum criticality in the frustrated two-leg
  Heisenberg ladder","The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the two-leg ladder with exchange
interactions along the chains, rungs, and diagonals is studied using the
Jordan-Wigner transformation and bond-mean-field theory. The inclusion of all
three couplings introduces frustration to the system and depending on their
relative strengths the ladder can adopt one of three possible
magnetically-disordered gapped states. The phase diagram found in this
mean-field approach is in very good agreement with the one calculated by
Weihong and colleagues using the Lanczos exact diagonalization method. By
analyzing the ground-state energy we study quantum criticality when the
coupling parameters are varied at zero temperature. We study the effect of
temperature on the phase boundaries, and find that the system shows
thermally-induced criticality for some values of the rung and diagonal coupling
constants. All the phase transitions encountered in this system occur between
disordered phases, and are all caused by frustration.",2007-02-16T20:46:36Z
Quantum Turbulence in a Trapped Bose-Einstein Condensate,"We study quantum turbulence in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates by
numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Combining rotations around
two axes, we successfully induce quantum turbulent state in which quantized
vortices are not crystallized but tangled. The obtained spectrum of the
incompressible kinetic energy is consistent with the Kolmogorov law, the most
important statistical law in turbulence.",2007-03-23T06:18:35Z
"Behavior of bulk high-temperature superconductors of finite thickness
  subjected to crossed magnetic fields","Crossed magnetic field effects on bulk high-temperature superconductors have
been studied both experimentally and numerically. The sample geometry
investigated involves finite-size effects along both (crossed) magnetic field
directions. The experiments were carried out on bulk melt-processed Y-Ba-Cu-O
(YBCO) single domains that had been pre-magnetized with the applied field
parallel to their shortest direction (i.e. the c-axis) and then subjected to
several cycles of the application of a transverse magnetic field parallel to
the sample ab plane. The magnetic properties were measured using orthogonal
pick-up coils, a Hall probe placed against the sample surface and
Magneto-Optical Imaging (MOI). We show that all principal features of the
experimental data can be reproduced qualitatively using a two-dimensional
finite-element numerical model based on an E-J power law and in which the
current density flows perpendicularly to the plane within which the two
components of magnetic field are varied. The results of this study suggest that
the suppression of the magnetic moment under the action of a transverse field
can be predicted successfully by ignoring the existence of flux-free
configurations or flux-cutting effects. These investigations show that the
observed decay in magnetization results from the intricate modification of
current distribution within the sample cross-section. It is also shown that the
model does not predict any saturation of the magnetic induction, even after a
large number (~ 100) of transverse field cycles. These features are shown to be
consistent with the experimental data.",2007-03-13T09:45:14Z
Electronic structure of spheroidal fullerenes,"Graphite is an example of a layered material that can be bent to form
fullerenes which promise important applications in electronic nanodevices. The
spheroidal geometry of a slightly elliptically deformed sphere was used as a
possible approach to fullerenes. We assumed that for a small deformation the
eccentricity of the spheroid is much more smaller then one. We are interested
in the elliptically deformed fullerenes C70 as well as in C60 and its spherical
generalizations like big C240 and C540 molecules. In the next study the
expanded field-theory model was proposed to study the electronic states near
the Fermi energy in spheroidal fullerenes. The low energy electronic wave
functions obey a two-dimensional Dirac equation on a spheroid with two kinds of
gauge fluxes taken into account. We shown exactly how a small deformation of
spherical fullerenes provokes an appearance of fine structure in the electronic
energy spectrum as compared to the spherical case. The effect of a weak uniform
magnetic field on the electronic structure of slightly deformed fullerene
molecules was also studied. We shown that the fine structure of the electronic
energy spectrum is very sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field. We
found that the magnetic field pointed in the x direction does not influence the
first electronic level whereas it causes a splitting of the second energy
level.",2007-03-22T13:13:40Z
"Local Structure of Multiferroic TbMn2O5: Evidence for an Anomalous
  Terbium Oxygen Distribution","The temperature dependent local structure of TbMn2O5 was determined by x-ray
absorption spectroscopy. An anomalous Tb-O distribution is found. At high
temperature it is broad but resolves into two distinct peaks below
approximately 180 K. The distributions sharpen below the Tb magnetic ordering
temperature (approximately 10 K). The distortions in the Tb-O distribution,
away from the Pbam structure, are consistent with rotations of the MnOx
polyhedra about the c-axis and suggest that Tb-O bond polarization may play a
significant role in the observed ferroelectric properties of this system.",2007-02-27T00:53:25Z
"Scaling Behavior and Variable Hopping Conductivity in the Quantum Hall
  Plateau Transition","We have measured the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity
$% \rho_{xx}$ of a two-dimensional electron system in the regime of the quantum
Hall plateau transition. We extracted the quantitative form of scaling function
for $\rho_{xx}$ and compared it with the results of ordinary scaling theory and
variable range hopping based theory. We find that the two alternative
theoretically proposed scaling functions are valid in different regions.",2007-03-27T12:22:38Z
Electrodynamics near the Metal-to-Insulator Transition in V3O5,"The electrodynamics near the metal-to-insulator transitions (MIT) induced, in
V3O5 single crystals, by both temperature (T) and pressure (P) has been studied
by infrared spectroscopy. The T- and P-dependence of the optical conductivity
may be explained within a polaronic scenario. The insulating phase at ambient T
and P corresponds to strongly localized small polarons. Meanwhile the T-induced
metallic phase at ambient pressure is related to a liquid of polarons showing
incoherent dc transport, in the P-induced metallic phase at room T strongly
localized polarons coexist with partially delocalized ones. The electronic
spectral weight is almost recovered, in both the T and P induced metallization
processes, on an energy scale of 1 eV, thus supporting the key-role of
electron-lattice interaction in the V3O5 metal-to-insulator transition.",2007-01-30T11:19:24Z
Controlling surface morphologies by time-delayed feedback,"We propose a new method to control the roughness of a growing surface, via a
time-delayed feedback scheme. As an illustration, we apply this method to the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in 1+1 dimensions and show that the effective
growth exponent of the surface width can be stabilized at any desired value in
the interval [0.25,0.33], for a significant length of time. The method is quite
general and can be applied to a wide range of growth phenomena. A possible
experimental realization is suggested.",2007-01-09T13:10:41Z
"Calculation of Binding Energies for Fractional Quantum Hall States with
  Even Denominators","Fractional quantum Hall states with even denominators have the following
specific properties: states with filling factors nu=5/8, 7/10, 3/8, 3/10, and
so on have respective local minima in the experimental curve of diagonal
resistivity Rxx versus magnetic field strength. These states are not standard
composite fermion states and are described in the expanded framework. For that
reason, the binding energies of these states are not obtained. Therefore, it is
meaningful to calculate those binding energies using various means. We
calculate the binding energies of electron pairs in nearest neighbor orbitals
or nearest neighbor hole pairs using the second-order perturbation method for
the Coulomb interactions among many electrons. The calculated binding energies
per electron are (1/10)Z2 for nu=5/8, (2/35)Z2 for nu=7/10, (1/6)Z2 for nu=3/8
and (2/15)Z2 for nu=3/10 and so on, but they are zero for nu=1/2, nu=1/4,
nu=3/4, nu=1/6, nu=5/6, nu=1/8, nu=7/8, nu=1/10, nu=9/10, nu=1/12 and nu=11/12.
The higher order calculations also show the same behavior as in the second
order. These results further elucidate some aspects of experimental data.",2007-03-14T08:17:53Z
Unitary Fermi gas in the epsilon expansion,"We construct systematic expansions around four and two spatial dimensions for
a Fermi gas near the unitarity limit. Near four spatial dimensions such a Fermi
gas can be understood as a weakly-interacting system of fermionic and bosonic
degrees of freedom. To the leading and next-to-leading orders in the expansion
over \epsilon=4-d, with d being the dimensionality of space, we determine the
thermodynamic functions, the fermion quasiparticle spectrum, the critical
polarizations, and the critical temperature as functions of the binding energy
of the two-body state. We also show that the unitary Fermi gas near two spatial
dimensions reduces to a weakly-interacting Fermi gas and calculate the
thermodynamic functions and the fermion quasiparticle spectrum in the expansion
over \bar\epsilon=d-2. We discuss the matching of the two systematic expansions
around four and two spatial dimensions in order to extract physical observables
at d=3. We find good agreement of the results with those from recent Monte
Carlo simulations.",2007-03-19T14:34:25Z
Inverse slow relaxation in granular hopping systems,"We present experimental results that demonstrate a glassy behavior in the
conductance of quench condensed insulating granular metals that is different
from that observed in continuous disordered systems. Exciting the granular
system by biasing the sample with a high electric field results in a slow
conductance change both during the excitation and during the relaxation back to
its steady state. The time scales for these processes are many orders of
magnitudes longer than the typical hopping time. We find that, initially, this
conductance change has an opposite sign to that observed in similar experiments
performed on continuous films. Only after relatively long times this trend is
reversed and the samples exhibit conventional behavior. We suggest that the
granular systems exhibit a new glassy process related to charge redistribution
among the grains. This process combines with the relaxation processes that are
characteristic of disordered systems to give rise to a unique relaxation
profile.",2007-01-16T05:35:43Z
"The ensemble effects on adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethylene on
  PdAu(001) bimetallic surfaces","First-principles calculations are performed to study the adsorption and
dehydrogenation of ethylene on PdAu(001) bimetallic surfaces. The activation
energies for C-H bond breaking of ethylene strongly depend on the ensemble
effect. Particularly, ethylene is unlikely to decompose on the most popular
ensembles of PdAu(001), Pd monomers or Pd second neighborhoods, since the Pd-Au
bridges are less attractive towards vinyl and the eliminated H atom than the
Pd-Pd bridges in the transition state. Correlations are found among the
activation energies, reaction energies and adsorption energies, but no obvious
relationship exist between the surface activity and the Pd-d band center.",2007-01-31T09:50:59Z
Essential Inputs and Minimal Tree Automata,"We continue studying essential inputs of trees and automata. Strongly

"Conductance and thermoelectric power in carbon nanotubes with magnetic
  impurities","By introducing a normal self-energy to incorporate the effects of magnetic
impurities, Kondo effects in single-walled metallic carbon nanotubes are
investigated within the Anderson model and Landauer formula. Magnetic
impurities induce Kondo resonance and bring a valley of conductance unction
near the Fermi level. The conductance of the nanotube increases with the
temperature in the low temperature range. Thermoelectric power induced by
magnetic impurities is gotten from Mott relation, and the calculations indicate
its dependence on the temperature could interpret the experiment well.",2007-03-14T14:19:08Z
"On the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation of quasiparticles: on the
  possibility of condensation of magnons at high temperatures","Bose condensation of quasiparticles in physical systems of finite size iz
considered for the case of ferromagnetic thin films. It is shown that in
accordance with present-day experimental capabilities which permit one to
achieve densities of long-wave spin excitation of 1018-1019 cm-3, in such films
the formation of condensate of such quasiparticles begins at temperatures T~100
K (room one including). It is found that Bose condensation is accompanied by
scaling phenomenon according to which the main thermodynamic variable is not
the number N of particles but the ratio N/T. This indicates that condensation
of magnons can be observed at relatively low magnon densities. The roles played
by the shape of the spectrum and film thickness are analyzed.",2007-01-18T09:28:13Z
"Fe K Line Profile in Low-redshift Quasars: Average Shape and Eddington
  Ratio Dependence","We analyze X-ray spectra of 43 Palomar-Green quasars observed with {\it
XMM-Newton} in order to investigate their mean Fe K line profile and its
dependence on physical properties. The continuum spectra of 39 objects are well
reproduced by a model consisting of a power law and a blackbody modified by
Galactic absorption. The spectra of the remaining four objects require an
additional power-law component absorbed with a column density of $\sim 10^{23}
{\rm cm}^{-2}$. We fit the entire sample simultaneously to derive average Fe
line parameters by assuming a common Fe line shape. The Fe line is relatively
narrow ($\sigma=0.36$ keV), with a center energy of 6.48 keV and a mean
equivalent width (EW) of 248 eV. By combining black hole masses estimated from
the virial method and bolometric luminosities derived from full spectral energy
distributions, we examine the dependence of the Fe K line profile on Eddington
ratio. As the Eddington ratio increases, the line becomes systematically
stronger (EW = 130 to 280 eV), broader ($\sigma=0.1$ to 0.7 keV), and peaks at
higher energies (6.4 to 6.8 keV). This result suggests that the accretion rate
onto the black hole directly influences the geometrical structure and
ionization state of the accretion disk.",2007-03-14T09:23:43Z
"Quantum Chemistry, Magnetism and Lasers","Using highly correlational quantum chemistry we compute from first principles
the contributions of the electric dipoles and quadupoles, and magnetic dipoles

explaining the experimental results.",2007-03-23T13:32:57Z
"Big-Rip, Sudden Future, and other exotic singularities in the universe","We discuss exotic singularities in the evolution of the universe motivated by
the progress of observations in cosmology. Among them there are: Big-Rip (BR),
Sudden Future Singularities (SFS), Generalized Sudden Future Singularities
(GSFS), Finite Density Singularities (FD), type III, and type IV singularities.
We relate some of these singularities with higher-order characteristics of
expansion such as jerk and snap. We also discuss the behaviour of pointlike
objects and classical strings on the approach to these singularities.",2007-01-10T09:54:44Z
"Deconvolving Instrumental and Intrinsic Broadening in Excited State
  X-ray Spectroscopies","Intrinsic and experimental mechanisms frequently lead to broadening of
spectral features in excited-state spectroscopies. For example, intrinsic
broadening occurs in x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements of heavy
elements where the core-hole lifetime is very short. On the other hand,
nonresonant x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) and other energy loss measurements are
more limited by instrumental resolution. Here, we demonstrate that the
Richardson-Lucy (RL) iterative algorithm provides a robust method for
deconvolving instrumental and intrinsic resolutions from typical XAS and XRS
data. For the K-edge XAS of Ag, we find nearly complete removal of ~9.3 eV FWHM
broadening from the combined effects of the short core-hole lifetime and
instrumental resolution. We are also able to remove nearly all instrumental
broadening in an XRS measurement of diamond, with the resulting improved
spectrum comparing favorably with prior soft x-ray XAS measurements. We present
a practical methodology for implementing the RL algorithm to these problems,
emphasizing the importance of testing for stability of the deconvolution
process against noise amplification, perturbations in the initial spectra, and
uncertainties in the core-hole lifetime.",2007-02-01T05:22:08Z
Thermodynamic Theory of Sintering and Swelling,"The General Thermodynamic Theory of Sintering, formulated by the author in
1998 is given. This theory is applied to the problem of swelling of materials
under conditions of radiation. Driving forces, caused by the presence of the
evolution of heat in the volume of a sample (electric contact, hf, inductive
heating or penetrating radiation, e.g., neutrons could be the sources of the
heat in the bulk of a sample) are considered. The influence of these driving
forces on sintering, structure and properties is discussed. The role of mobile
and immobile dislocations, grain boundaries, and pores is regarded. Cycling and
pulsing regimes of sintering are investigated. A mesoscopic approach, described
in present paper, which had been used for years to solve sintering problems,
also could help solving problems of nucleation, decomposition, and other
problems in the theory of alloys. Described relaxation time technique could
help simplifying calculations and give more clear physical picture. Bulks
heating driving forces, important for small size objects of microelectronics
or/and heat evolving elements in nuclear reactors, are important also for the
problems of nucleation and decomposition in these objects.",2007-01-30T11:45:07Z
Persistent Supercurrent Atom Chip,"Rubidium 87 atoms are trapped in an Ioffe-Pritchard potential generated with
a persistent supercurrent that flows in a loop circuit patterned on a sapphire
surface. The superconducting circuit is a closed loop made of 100 micro meter
wide MBE-grown MgB2 stripe carrying a supercurrent of 2.5 A. To control the
supercurrent in the stripe, an on-chip thermal switch operated by a focused
argon-ion laser is developed. The switch operates as an on/off switch of the
supercurrent, or as a device to set the current to a specific value with the
aid of an external magnetic field. The current can be set even without an
external source if the change is in decreasing direction.",2007-02-06T14:20:19Z
"Accurate Modelling of Left-Handed Metamaterials Using Finite-Difference
  Time-Domain Method with Spatial Averaging at the Boundaries","The accuracy of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modelling of left-handed
metamaterials (LHMs) is dramatically improved by using an averaging technique
along the boundaries of LHM slabs. The material frequency dispersion of LHMs is
taken into account using auxiliary differential equation (ADE) based dispersive
FDTD methods. The dispersive FDTD method with averaged permittivity along the
material boundaries is implemented for a two-dimensional (2-D) transverse
electric (TE) case. A mismatch between analytical and numerical material
parameters (e.g. permittivity and permeability) introduced by the time
discretisation in FDTD is demonstrated. The expression of numerical
permittivity is formulated and it is suggested to use corrected permittivity in
FDTD simulations in order to model LHM slabs with their desired parameters. The
influence of switching time of source on the oscillation of field intensity is
analysed. It is shown that there exists an optimum value which leads to fast
convergence in simulations.",2007-02-06T15:53:35Z
Gravitomagnetic London Moment in Rotating Supersolid $He^4$,"Non classical rotational inertia observed in rotating supersolid $He^4$ can

"Reconstructing the Nonlinear Filter Function of LILI-128 Stream Cipher
  Based on Complexity","In this letter we assert that we have reconstructed the nonlinear filter
function of LILI-128 stream cipher on IBM notebook PC using MATLAB. Our
reconstruction need approximately 2^12~2^13 and the attack consumes 5825.016
sec (using tic and toc sentences of MATLAB) or 5825.016/3600=1.6181hours. We
got the expression of the nonlinear filter function fd of Lili-128 which has 46
items from liner items to nonlinear items based on complexity, the phase space
reconstruction, Clustering and nonlinear prediction. We have verified our
reconstruction result correctness by simulating the overview of Lili-128
keystream generators using our getting fd and implement designers reference
module of the Lili-128 stream cipher, and two methods produce the same
synchronous keystream sequence on same initial state, so that our research work
proves that the nonlinear filter function of LILI-128 stream cipher is
successfully reconstructed.",2007-02-22T14:03:51Z
"Discontinuous Meniscus Location in Tapered Capillaries Driven by
  Pressure Difference and Dielectrophoretic Forces","We calculate the meniscus location in tapered capillaries under the influence
of pressure difference and dielectrophoretic forces with and without gravity.
We find that the meniscus location can be a discontinuous function of the
pressure difference or the applied voltage and that the meniscus can ``jump''
to one end or another of the capillary. Phase diagrams are given as a function
of the pressure and voltage, depending on the geometrical parameters of the
system. We further consider a revision of the dielectric rise under
dielectrophoretic force in wedge capillaries and in the case of electrowetting,
where the dielectrophoretic force is a small perturbation. Finally, we also
find discontinuous liquid--gas interface location in the case of liquid
penetration into closed volumes.",2007-02-05T13:09:35Z
Statefinder diagnostic for the modified polytropic Cardassian universe,"We apply the Statefinder diagnostic to the Modified Polytropic Cardassian
Universe in this work. We find that the Statefinder diagnostic is quite
effective to distinguish Cardassian models from a series of other cosmological
models. The $s-r$ plane is used to classify the Modified Polytropic Cardassian
models into six cases. The evolutionary trajectories in the $s-r$ plane for the
cases with different $n$ and $\beta$ reveal different evolutionary properties
of the universe. In addition, we combine the observational $H(z)$ data, the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation
(BAO) data to make a joint analysis. We find that \textbf{Case 2} can be
excluded at the 68.3% confidence level and any case is consistent with the
observations at the 95.4% confidence level.",2007-03-24T15:48:06Z
Scaling of resistivities and guided vortex motion in MgB2 thin films,"Longitudinal and transverse voltages have been measured on thin films of MgB2
with different superconducting transition widths. The study has been performed
in zero and non-zero external magnetic fields. The non-zero transverse voltage
has been observed in close vicinity of the critical temperature in zero
external magnetic field, while further away from Tc this voltage becomes zero.
In magnetic field it becomes a transverse voltage which is an even function
with respect to the direction of the field. The usual Hall voltage starts to
appear with increasing magnetic field and in large fields the even voltage
disappears and only the Hall voltage is measurable (i.e. the transverse even
voltage is suppressed with increasing magnetic field and increasing transport
current). New scaling between transverse and longitudinal resistivities has
been observed. This correlation is valid not only in the zero magnetic field
but also in nonzero magnetic field where transverse even voltage is detected.
Several models trying to explain observed results are discussed. The most
promising one seems to be guided motion of the vortices, though further
theoretical work will be required to confirm this.",2007-01-31T13:11:54Z
Strain relaxation in GaN grown on vicinal 4H-SiC(0001) substrates,"The strain of GaN layers grown by Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition
(MOCVD) on three vicinal 4H-SiC substrates (0, 3.4 and 8 offcut from [0001]
towards [11-20] axis) is investigated by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman
Scattering and Cathodoluminescence (CL). The strain relaxation mechanisms are
analyzed for each miscut angle. At a microscopic scale, the GaN layer grown on
on-axis substrate has a slight and homogeneous tensile in-plane stress due to a
uniform distribution of threading dislocations over the whole surface. The GaN
layers grown on miscut substrates presented cracks, separating areas which have
a stronger tensile in-plane stress but a more elastic strain. The plastic
relaxation mechanisms involved in these layers are attributed to the step flow
growth on misoriented surfaces (dislocations and stacking faults) and to the
macroscopical plastic release of additional thermoelastic stress upon cooling
down (cracks).",2007-02-21T12:50:03Z
"Best-Fit Ellipsoids of Atom-Probe Tomographic Data to Study Coalescence
  of Gamma Prime (L1_2) Precipitates in Ni-Al-Cr","An algorithm is presented to fit precipitates in atom probe tomographic data

the radius of gyration, these ellipsoids retain the moments of inertia and
principle axes of the original precipitate, preserving crystallographic

Mean-field heat capacity of dilute magnetic alloys,"Using an asymptotic solution of the M-impurity thermodynamics of a dilute s-d

for dilute magnetic alloys with spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 impurities. The
parameters which enter DeltaC are adjusted to fit experimental data on impurity
heat capacity of CuCr and LaCeAl_2. Agreement is satisfactory for CuCr, at
temperatures below 1K, and good for LaCeAl_2. The magnitude of theoretical
DeltaC(T) agrees with experiment and does not require scaling as in previous
s-d theories. Nonlinear dependence of DeltaC(T) on impurity concentration has
been accounted for the first time.",2007-03-06T10:07:33Z

particles join is of order $q$. However, the proposed wavefunctions also
incorporate the crystalline correlations of the mean field problem, through a
determinantal mean field function entering their construction. The above
properties, lead to the expectation that the considered states can be
competitive in energy per particle with the Laughlin ones. Their similar
structure also could explain way the breaking of the translation invariance in
the FQHE ground states can result to be a weak one, which after disregarded,
produce the Laughlin states as good approximations. Calculation for checking
these possibilities are under consideration.",2007-02-12T21:00:32Z
"Spin Triplet Superconducting State due to Broken Inversion Symmetry in
  Li_2Pt_3B","We report ^{11}B and ^{195}Pt NMR measurements in non-centrosymmetric
superconductor Li_2Pt_3B. We find that the spin susceptibility measured by the
Knight shift remains unchanged across the superconducting transition
temperature T_c. With decreasing temperature (T) below T_c, the spin-lattice
relaxation rate 1/T_1 decreases with no coherence peak and is in proportion to
T^3. These results indicate that the Cooper pair is in the spin-triplet state
and that there exist line nodes in the superconducting gap function. They are
in sharp contrast with those in the isostructural Li_2Pd_3B which is a
spin-singlet, s-wave superconductor, and are ascribed to the enhanced
spin-orbit coupling due to the lack of spatial inversion symmetry. Our finding
points to a new paradigm where exotic superconductivity arises in the absence
of strong electron-electron correlations.",2007-02-06T08:47:54Z
"Linear Response Theory and the Universal Nature of the Magnetic
  Excitation Spectrum of the Cuprates","Linear response theory, commonly known as the random phase approximation
(RPA), predicts a rich magnetic excitation spectrum for d-wave superconductors.
Many of the features predicted by such calculations appear to be reflected in
inelastic neutron scattering data of the cuprates. In this article, I will
present results from RPA calculations whose input is based on angle resolved
photoemission data, and discuss possible relevance to inelastic neutron
scattering data of LSCO, YBCO, and Bi2212 in their superconducting and
non-superconducting phases. In particular, the question of the universality of
the magnetic excitation spectrum will be addressed.",2007-01-29T17:53:45Z
Non-converging hysteretic cycles in random spin networks,"Behavior of hysteretic trajectories for cyclical input is investigated as a
function of the internal structure of a system modeled by the classical random
network of binary spins. Different regimes of hysteretic behavior are
discovered for different network connectivity and topology. Surprisingly,
hysteretic trajectories which do not converge at all are observed. They are
shown to be associated with the presence of specific topological elements in
the network structure, particularly with the fully interconnected spin groups
of size equal or greater than 4.",2007-03-20T17:59:56Z
"Visualizing the strain field in semiflexible polymer networks: strain
  fluctuations and nonlinear rheology of F-actin gels","We image semi-flexible polymer networks under shear at the micrometer scale.
By tracking embedded probe particles, we determine the local strain field, and
directly measure its uniformity, or degree of affineness, on scales of 2-100
micron. The degree of nonaffine strain depends on polymer length and crosslink
density, consistent with theoretical predictions. We also find a direct
correspondence between the uniformity of the microscale strain and the
nonlinear elasticity of the networks in the bulk.",2007-02-14T03:23:20Z
The nature of the Wolf-Rayet galaxy Mrk 209 from photoionization models,"We present a detailed photoionisation model of the brightest knot of star
format ion in the blue compact dwarf galaxy Mrk 209. The model reproduces the
intensiti es of main lines emitted by the ionised gas, resulting in a very good
agreement between observed and predicted line temperatures and chemical
abundances of the observed ionic species. The model has been calculated using
the spectral energy distribution of a massive cluster of recent formation as
the ionising source. The features of Wolf-Rayet stars observed in the spectrum
of the object, along with its ionising properties, lead to different solutions
for the ages and characteristics of the ionising stellar populations.The found
solutions are compatible with either a composite population of two ionising
clusters or a continuous star formation. In the first case, a young cluster,
with an age less than 3 Myr, would be responsible for most of the ionisation
properties while an older cluster, with either 3.2 or 4.2 Myr, would be
responsible for the emission of the observed WR features in the spectrum of the
knot. In the second case, the duration of the star formation episode is found
to be 3.6 Myr. The addition of a certain amout of dust was required in order to
reproduce correctly the measured electron temperatures. This dust implies a
gas/dust ratio identical to that in the Milky Way, and a fraction of absorbed
photons of f = 0.58. The taking into account the dust grain physics combined
with a thick-shell geometry solves the problem of the heating in this object
and allows the fitting of the auroral lines, the line temperatures and the
ionisation structure of the nebula with a negligible presence of temperature
fluctuations, in agreement with the most recent results found for this type of
objects from the measurement of the Balmer jump temperature.",2007-03-13T15:28:39Z
Non-Abelian Anyon Superconductivity,"Non-Abelian Anyons exist in certain spin models and may exist in Quantuam
Hall systems at certain filling fractions. In this work we studied the ground
state of dynamical SU(2) level-$\kappa$ Chern Simons non-Abelian anyons at
finite density and no external magnetic field. We find that in the
large-$\kappa$ limit the topological interaction induces a pairing instability
and the ground state is a superconductor with $\it{d+id}$ gap symmetry. We also
develop a picture of pairing for the special value $\kappa=2$ and argue that
the ground state is a superfluid of pairs for all values of $\kappa$.",2007-03-03T20:50:34Z
Cold HI in Turbulent Eddies and Galactic Spiral Shocks,"HI 21cm-line self-absorption (HISA) reveals the shape and distribution of
cold atomic clouds in the Galactic disk. Many of these clouds lack
corresponding CO emission, despite being colder than purely atomic gas in
equilibrium models. HISA requires background line emission at the same
velocity, hence mechanisms that can produce such backgrounds. Weak,
small-scale, and widespread absorption is likely to arise from turbulent
eddies, while strong, large-scale absorption appears organized in cloud
complexes along spiral arm shocks. In the latter, the gas may be evolving from
an atomic to a molecular state prior to star formation, which would account for
the incomplete HISA-CO agreement.",2007-03-03T01:44:05Z
Phase Field Theory of Nucleation and Polycrystalline Pattern Formation,"We review our recent modeling of crystal nucleation and polycrystalline
growth using a phase field theory. First, we consider the applicability of
phase field theory for describing crystal nucleation in a model hard sphere
fluid. It is shown that the phase field theory accurately predicts the
nucleation barrier height for this liquid when the model parameters are fixed
by independent molecular dynamics calculations. We then address various aspects
of polycrystalline solidification and associated crystal pattern formation at
relatively long timescales. This late stage growth regime, which is not
accessible by molecular dynamics, involves nucleation at the growth front to
create new crystal grains in addition to the effects of primary nucleation.
Finally, we consider the limit of extreme polycrystalline growth, where the
disordering effect due to prolific grain formation leads to isotropic growth
patterns at long times, i.e., spherulite formation. Our model of spherulite
growth exhibits branching at fixed grain misorientations, induced by the
inclusion of a metastable minimum in the orientational free energy. It is
demonstrated that a broad variety of spherulitic patterns can be recovered by
changing only a few model parameters.",2007-03-26T13:15:31Z
Phase Coherent Transport of Charges in Graphene Quantum Billiard,"We experimentally investigate electrical transport properties of graphene,
which is a two dimensional (2D) conductor with relativistic energy dispersion
relation. By investigating single- and bi-layer graphene devices with different
aspect ratios, we confirm experimentally that the minimum conductivity in wide
and short graphene strips approaches the theoretical value of 4e^2/\pi\h. At
low temperatures, quantum interference of multiply-reflected waves of electrons
and holes in graphene give rise to periodic conductance oscillations with bias
and gate voltages. Thus graphene acts as a quantum billiard, a 2D ballistic,
phase coherent electron system with long phase coherence length that exceeds 5
microns. Additional features in differential conductance emerge when graphene
is coupled to superconducting electrodes. We observe proximity-induced enhanced
conductance at low bias, and conductance dips at energy scales far above the
superconducting gap of the electrodes. The latter provides preliminary evidence
for a novel superconducting material that consists of graphene coated with
metallic atoms.",2007-03-02T10:51:23Z
"Self-adaptive Gossip Policies for Distributed Population-based
  Algorithms","Gossipping has demonstrate to be an efficient mechanism for spreading
information among P2P networks. Within the context of P2P computing, we propose
the so-called Evolvable Agent Model for distributed population-based algorithms
which uses gossipping as communication policy, and represents every individual
as a self-scheduled single thread. The model avoids obsolete nodes in the
population by defining a self-adaptive refresh rate which depends on the
latency and bandwidth of the network. Such a mechanism balances the migration
rate to the congestion of the links pursuing global population coherence. We
perform an experimental evaluation of this model on a real parallel system and
observe how solution quality and algorithm speed scale with the number of
processors with this seamless approach.",2007-03-23T11:29:10Z
Exact Analysis of Entanglement in Gapped Quantum Spin Chains,"We investigate the entanglement properties of the valence-bond-solid states
with generic integer-spin $S$. Using the Schwinger boson representation of the
valence-bond-solid states, the entanglement entropy, the von Neumann entropy of
a subsystem, is obtained exactly and its relationship with the usual
correlation function is clarified. The saturation value of the entanglement
entropy, $2 \log_2 (S+1)$, is derived explicitly and is interpreted in terms of
the edge-state picture. The validity of our analytical results and the
edge-state picture is numerically confirmed. We also propose a novel
application of the edge state as a qubit for quantum computation.",2007-02-08T08:02:24Z
Hydrogen Dynamics in Superprotonic CsHSO4,"We present a detailed study of proton dynamics in the hydrogen-bonded
superprotonic conductor CsHSO4 from first-principles molecular dynamics
simulations, isolating the subtle interplay between the dynamics of the O--H
chemical bonds, the O...H hydrogen bonds, and the SO4 tetrahedra in promoting
proton diffusion. We find that the Grotthus mechanism of proton transport is
primarily responsible for the dynamics of the chemical bonds, whereas the
reorganization of the hydrogen-bond network is dominated by rapid angular hops
in concert with small reorientations of the SO4 tetrahedra. Frequent proton
jumping across the O--H...O complex is countered by a high rate of jump
reversal, which we show is connected to the dynamics of the SO4 tetrahedra,
resulting in a diminished CsHSO4/CsDSO4 isotope effect. We also find evidence
of multiple timescales for SO4 reorientation events, leading to distinct
diffusion mechanisms along the different crystal lattice directions. Finally,
we employ graph-theoretic techniques to characterize the topology of the
hydrogen-bond network and demonstrate a clear relationship between certain
connectivity configurations and the likelihood for diffusive jump events.",2007-02-25T09:03:36Z
Probabilistic Analysis of Linear Programming Decoding,"We initiate the probabilistic analysis of linear programming (LP) decoding of
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Specifically, we show that for a random
LDPC code ensemble, the linear programming decoder of Feldman et al. succeeds
in correcting a constant fraction of errors with high probability. The fraction
of correctable errors guaranteed by our analysis surpasses previous
non-asymptotic results for LDPC codes, and in particular exceeds the best
previous finite-length result on LP decoding by a factor greater than ten. This
improvement stems in part from our analysis of probabilistic bit-flipping
channels, as opposed to adversarial channels. At the core of our analysis is a
novel combinatorial characterization of LP decoding success, based on the
notion of a generalized matching. An interesting by-product of our analysis is
to establish the existence of ``probabilistic expansion'' in random bipartite
graphs, in which one requires only that almost every (as opposed to every) set
of a certain size expands, for sets much larger than in the classical
worst-case setting.",2007-02-02T06:30:48Z
Disk galaxy rotation curves and dark matter distribution,"After explaining the motivation for this article, I briefly recapitulate the
methods used to determine, somewhat coarsely, the rotation curves of our Milky
Way Galaxy and other spiral galaxies, especially in their outer parts, and the
results of applying these methods. Recent observations and models of the very
inner central parts of galaxian rotation curves are only briefly described. I
then present the essential Newtonian theory of (disk) galaxy rotation curves.
The next two sections present two numerical simulation schemes and brief
results. Application of modified Newtonian dynamics to the outer parts of disk
galaxies is then described. Finally, attempts to apply Einsteinian general
relativity to the dynamics are summarized. The article ends with a summary and
prospects for further work in this area.",2007-03-16T06:02:19Z
Exchange and Correlation in Open Systems of Fluctuating Electron Number,"While the exact total energy of a separated open system varies linearly as a
function of average electron number between adjacent integers, the energy
predicted by semi-local density functional approximations curves upward and the
exact-exchange-only or Hartree-Fock energy downward. As a result, semi-local
density functionals fail for separated open systems of fluctuating electron
number, as in stretched molecular ions A$_2^{+}$ and in solid transition metal
oxides. We develop an exact-exchange theory and an exchange-hole sum rule that
explain these failures and we propose a way to correct them via a local hybrid
functional.",2007-02-12T17:33:02Z
Temporal Variations in Fibril Orientation,"We measure variations in orientation of fourteen dynamic fibrils as a
function of time in a small isolated plage and nearby network using a 10-min
time sequence of H-alpha filtergrams obtained by the Dutch Open Telescope. We
found motions with average angular velocities of the order of 1 deg/min
suggesting systematic turning from one limit position to another, particularly
apparent in the case of fibrils with lifetimes of a few minutes. Shorter
fibrils tend to turn faster than longer ones, which we interpret as due to
vortex flows in the underlying granulation that twist magnetic fields.",2007-03-28T16:54:33Z
Microscopic theory of the quantum Hall hierarchy,"We solve the quantum Hall problem exactly in a limit and show that the ground
states can be organized in a fractal pattern consistent with the
Haldane-Halperin hierarchy, and with the global phase diagram. We present wave
functions for a large family of states, including those of Laughlin and Jain
and also for states recently observed by Pan {\it et. al.}, and show that they
coincide with the exact ones in the solvable limit. We submit that they
establish an adiabatic continuation of our exact results to the experimentally
accessible regime, thus providing a unified approach to the hierarchy states.",2007-02-22T15:22:37Z
"Conductance quantization in graphene nanoribbons: Adiabatic
  approximation","A theory of electron states for graphene nanoribbons with a smoothly varying
width is developed. It is demonstrated that the standard adiabatic
approximation allowing to neglect the mixing of different standing waves is
more restrictive for the massless Dirac fermions in graphene than for the
conventional electron gas. For the case of zigzag boundary conditions, one can
expect a well-pronounced conductance quantization only for highly excited
states. This difference is related to the relativistic Zitterbewegung effect in
graphene.",2007-03-07T17:39:34Z
Flat bands and Wigner crystallization in the honeycomb optical lattice,"We study the ground states of cold atoms in the tight-binding bands built
from p-orbitals on a two dimensional honeycomb optical lattice. The band
structure includes two completely flat bands. Exact many-body ground states
with on-site repulsion can be found at low particle densities, for both
fermions and bosons. We find crystalline order at n=1/6 with a $\sqrt{3} \times
\sqrt{3}$ structure breaking a number of discrete lattice symmetries. In
fermionic systems, if the repulsion is strong enough, we find the bonding
strength becomes \emph{dimerized} at n=1/2. Experimental signatures of
crystalline order can be detected through the noise correlations in time of
flight experiments.",2007-01-31T19:34:12Z
The nature of the rectilinear diameter singularity,"The rigorous explanation for the term $| t |^{2\beta}$ in the rectilinear
diameter equation is given ($t = (T_c-T)/T_c$, $\beta$ is the critical exponent
for the asymptotic form of the equation of state). The optimal order parameter,
for which the branches of binodal are symmetric is constructed within the
canonical formalism. It is shown that the ratio of the amplitudes
$\f{D_{2\beta}}{D_{1-\alpha}}$ before $|t|^{2\beta}$ and $|t|^{1-\alpha}$ where
$\alpha$ determines the behavior of the heat capacity, takes the universal
character. The analysis of entropy for argon and water leads to $\beta = 0.33$
and $\f{D_{2-\beta}}{{D_{1-\alpha}}}\approx - 3.5$.",2007-03-17T18:25:44Z
"{\sc CosmoNet}: fast cosmological parameter estimation in non-flat
  models using neural networks","We present a further development of a method for accelerating the calculation
of CMB power spectra, matter power spectra and likelihood functions for use in
cosmological Bayesian inference. The algorithm, called {\sc CosmoNet}, is based
on training a multilayer perceptron neural network. We compute CMB power
spectra (up to $\ell=2000$) and matter transfer functions over a hypercube in
parameter space encompassing the $4\sigma$ confidence region of a selection of
CMB (WMAP + high resolution experiments) and large scale structure surveys (2dF
and SDSS). We work in the framework of a generic 7 parameter non-flat
cosmology. Additionally we use {\sc CosmoNet} to compute the WMAP 3-year, 2dF
and SDSS likelihoods over the same region. We find that the average error in
the power spectra is typically well below cosmic variance for spectra, and
experimental likelihoods calculated to within a fraction of a log unit. We
demonstrate that marginalised posteriors generated with {\sc CosmoNet} spectra
agree to within a few percent of those generated by {\sc CAMB} parallelised
over 4 CPUs, but are obtained 2-3 times faster on just a \emph{single}
processor. Furthermore posteriors generated directly via {\sc CosmoNet}
likelihoods can be obtained in less than 30 minutes on a single processor,
corresponding to a speed up of a factor of $\sim 32$. We also demonstrate the
capabilities of {\sc CosmoNet} by extending the CMB power spectra and matter
transfer function training to a more generic 10 parameter cosmological model,
including tensor modes, a varying equation of state of dark energy and massive
neutrinos. {\sc CosmoNet} and interfaces to both {\sc CosmoMC} and {\sc
Bayesys} are publically available at {\tt
www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/cosmonet}.",2007-03-16T16:19:03Z
Searching for decaying axion-like dark matter from clusters of galaxies,"We consider the possibility of constraining the lifetime of radiatively
decaying dark matter particles in clusters of galaxies inspired from generic
axions of the Kaluza-Klein type. Such axions have been invoked as a possible
explanation for the coronal X-ray emission from the Sun. These axions, or
similar particles, can be produced inside stars and some of them remain
confined by the deep gravitational potential of clusters of galaxies.
Specifically, we consider regions within merging galaxy clusters (Abell 520 and
the ""Bullet Cluster""), where gravitational lensing observations have identified
massive, but baryon poor, structures. From an analysis of X-ray observations of
these mass concentrations, and the expected photon spectrum of decaying solar
KK-axions, we derive lower limits to the lifetime of such axions of tau approx.
10^23 sec. However, if KK-axions constitute less than a few percent of the dark
matter mass, this lifetime constraint is similar to that derived from solar
KK-axions.",2007-03-13T21:57:36Z
Frequency-Tunable Josephson Junction Resonator for Quantum Computing,"We have fabricated and measured a high-Q Josephson junction resonator with a
tunable resonance frequency. A dc magnetic flux allows the resonance frequency
to be changed by over 10 %. Weak coupling to the environment allows a quality
factor of $\thicksim$7000 when on average less than one photon is stored in the
resonator. At large photon numbers, the nonlinearity of the Josephson junction
creates two stable oscillation states. This resonator can be used as a tool for
investigating the quality of Josephson junctions in qubits below the single
photon limit, and can be used as a microwave qubit readout at high photon
numbers.",2007-03-04T17:50:28Z
"Evidence for a floating phase of the transverse ANNNI model at high
  frustration","We study the transverse quantum ANNNI model in the region of high frustration
(k>0.5) using the DMRG algorithm. We obtain a precise determination of the
phase diagram, showing clear evidence for the existence of a floating phase,
separated from the paramagnetic modulated phase by a high-order critical line
ending at the multicritical point. We obtain simple and accurate formulae for
the two critical lines.",2007-02-28T12:15:45Z
Phase separation in the crust of accreting neutron stars,"Nucleosynthesis, on the surface of accreting neutron stars, produces a range
of chemical elements. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of
crystallization to see how this complex composition forms new neutron star
crust. We find chemical separation, with the liquid ocean phase greatly
enriched in low atomic number elements compared to the solid crust. This phase
separation should change many crust properties such as the thermal conductivity
and shear modulus. The concentration of carbon, if present, is enriched in the
ocean. This may allow unstable thermonuclear burning of the carbon and help
explain the ignition of the very energetic explosions known as superbursts.",2007-03-03T16:27:38Z
Papapetrou Energy-Momentum Tensor for Chern-Simons Modified Gravity,"We construct a conserved, symmetric energy-momentum (pseudo-)tensor for
Chern-Simons modified gravity, thus demonstrating that the theory is Lorentz
invariant. The tensor is discussed in relation to other gravitational
energy-momentum tensors and analyzed for the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom,
and FRW solutions. To our knowledge this is the first confirmation that the
Reissner-Nordstrom and FRW metrics are solutions of the modified theory.",2007-02-05T21:46:32Z
A Search for Host Galaxies of 24 Gamma-Ray Bursts,"We report the results from observations of 24 gamma ray burst (GRB) fields
from 2005 and 2006 undertaken at the Danish 1.54m telescope at ESO/La Silla.
Photometry and positions for two previously unpublished host galaxy candidates
(GRBs 050915 and 051021) are presented, as well as for eight other detected
objects which are either known GRB hosts or candidate hosts. The candidates are
suitable for spectroscopic follow-up in order to have their redshifts and other
physical characteristics determined. In the cases where no likely host
candidate is detected inside the refined Swift XRT error circle we are still
able to put interesting and rather deep limits on the host magnitude. Based on
our detections and upper limits we have performed simulations which suggest
that the host galaxies are drawn from a fainter sample than previous (i.e.
pre-Swift) studies.",2007-03-15T10:56:07Z
Creation of multiple nanodots by single ions,"In the challenging search for tools that are able to modify surfaces on the
nanometer scale, heavy ions with energies of several 10 MeV are becoming more
and more attractive. In contrast to slow ions where nuclear stopping is
important and the energy is dissipated into a large volume in the crystal, in
the high energy regime the stopping is due to electronic excitations only.
Because of the extremely local (< 1 nm) energy deposition with densities of up
to 10E19 W/cm^2, nanoscaled hillocks can be created under normal incidence.
Usually, each nanodot is due to the impact of a single ion and the dots are
randomly distributed. We demonstrate that multiple periodically spaced dots
separated by a few 10 nanometers can be created by a single ion if the sample
is irradiated under grazing angles of incidence. By varying this angle the
number of dots can be controlled.",2007-01-29T10:59:45Z
"Rashba interferometers: Spin-dependent single and two-electron
  interference","Quantum transport in semiconductor nanostructures can be described
theoretically in terms of the propagation and scattering of electron
probability waves. Within this approach, elements of a phase-coherent electric
circuit play a role similar to quantum-optical devices that can be
characterised by scattering matrices. Electronic analogues of well-know optical
interferometers have been fabricated and used to study special features of
charge carriers in solids. We present results from our theoretical
investigation into the interplay between spin precession and quantum
interference in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer with spin-orbit
coupling of the Rashba type. Intriguing spin-dependent transport effects occur,
which can be the basis for novel spintronic devices such as a magnet-less
spin-controlled field-effect transistor and a variety of single-qubit gates.
Their functionality arises entirely from spin-dependent interference of each
single input electron with itself. We have also studied two-electron
interference effects for the spin-dependent Mach-Zehnder interferometer,
obtaining analytical expressions for its two-fermion-state scattering matrix.
Using this result, we consider ways to generate two-electron output states for
which the Rashba spin-subband quantum number and the output-arm index are
entangled. Combining spin-dependent interference in our proposed Mach-Zehnder
interferometer with a projective charge measurement at the output enables
entanglement generation. As our particular scheme involves tuneable spin
precession, electric-field control of entanglement production can be achieved.",2007-01-04T03:20:32Z
The Magnetic Topology of Coronal Mass Ejection sources,"In an attempt to test current initiation models of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs), with an emphasis on the magnetic breakout model, we inspect the
magnetic topology of the sources of 26 CME events in the context of their
chromospheric and coronal response in an interval of approximately nine hours
around the eruption onset. First, we perform current-free (potential)
extrapolations of photospheric magnetograms to retrieve the key topological
ingredients, such as coronal magnetic null points. Then we compare the
reconnection signatures observed in the high cadence and high spatial
resolution of the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE) images with
the location of the relevant topological features. The comparison reveals that
only seven events can be interpreted in terms of the breakout model, which
requires a multi-polar topology with pre-eruption reconnection at a coronal
null. We find, however, that a larger number of events (twelve) can not be
interpreted in those terms. No magnetic null is found in six of them. Seven
other cases remain difficult to interpret. We also show that there are no
systematic differences between the CME speed and flare energies of events under
different interpretations.",2007-03-02T18:16:41Z
"Long-term Correlations and 1/f^alpha Noise in the Steady States of
  Multi-Species Resistor Networks","We introduce a multi-species network model which describes the resistance
fluctuations of a resistor in a non-equilibrium stationary state. More
precisely, a thin resistor characterized by a 1/f^alpha resistance noise is
described as a two-dimensional network made by different species of elementary
resistors. The resistor species are distinguished by their resistances and by
their energies associated with thermally activated processes of breaking and
recovery. Depending on the external conditions, stationary states of the
network can arise as a result of the competition between these processes. The
properties of the network are studied as a function of the temperature by Monte
Carlo simulations carried out in the temperature range 300 \div 800 K. At low
temperatures, the resistance fluctuations display long-term correlations
expressed by a power-law behavior of the auto-correlation function and by a
value approx 1 of the alpha-exponent of the spectral density. On the contrary,
at high temperatures the resistance fluctuations exhibit a finite and
progressively smaller correlation time associated with a non-exponential decay
of correlations and with a value of the alpha-exponent smaller than one. This
temperature dependence of the alpha coefficient reproduces qualitatively well
the experimental findings.",2007-01-29T14:14:10Z
"Investigation of the Tunneling Spectra in HgBr2-Intercalated Bi-2212
  Single Crystals below and above Tc","Interlayer tunneling spectroscopy measurements were performed on mesa arrays
of Bi-2212 single crystals, intercalated with HgBr$_2$. Tunneling conductances
were obtained over a wide temperature range to examine the spectral features,
especially the behavior of the quasiparticle peaks corresponding to
superconducting energy gaps (SGs). Experimental spectra showed that gap-like
features are still present even for the temperatures far above the transition
temperature, T$_c$. This evidence is consistent with the idea that the SG
evolves into a pseudogap above T$_c$ for HgBr$_2$-intercalated Bi-2212 single
crystals.",2007-01-29T18:10:26Z
Fluxes in Hαand Ca II H and K for a sample of Southern stars,"The main chromospheric activity indicator is the S index, which is esentially
the ratio of the flux in the core of the Ca II H and K lines to the continuum
nearby, and is well studied basically for stars from F to K. Another usual
chromospheric proxy is the H\alpha line, which is beleived to be tightly
correlated with the Ca II index. In this work we characterize both
chromospheric activity indicators, one associated with the H and K Ca II lines
and the other with H\alpha, for the whole range of late type stars, from F to
M. We present periodical medium-resolution echelle observations covering the
complete visual range, which were taken at the CASLEO Argentinean Observatory.
These observations are distributed along 7 years. We use a total of 917
flux-calibrated spectra for 109 stars which range from F6 to M5. We
statistically study these two indicators for stars of different activity levels
and spectral types. We directly derive the conversion factor which translate
the known S index to flux in the Ca II cores, and extend its calibration to a
wider spectral range. We investigate the relation between the activity
measurements in the calcium and hydrogen lines, and found that the usual
correlation observed is basically the product of the dependence of each flux
with stellar colour, and not the product of similar activity phenomena.",2007-03-19T23:31:32Z
The 2006 hot phase of Romano's star (GR 290) in M33,"Understanding the nature of the instabilities of LBVs is important to
understand the late evolutionary stages of very massive stars.
  We investigate the long term, S Dor-type variability of the luminous blue
variable GR290 (Romano's star) in M33, and its 2006 minimum phase.
  New spectroscopic and photometric data taken in November and December 2006
were employed in conjunction with already published data on GR290 to derive the
physical structure of GR290 in different phases and the time scale of the
variability.
  We find that by the end of 2006, GR 290 had reached the deepest visual
minimum so far recorded. Its present spectrum resembles closely that of the
Of/WN9 stars, and is the hottest so far recorded in this star (and in any LBV
as well), while its visual brightness decreased by about 1.4 mag.
  This first spectroscopic record of GR290 during a minimum phase confirms
that, similarly to AG Car and other LBVs, the star is subject to ample S
Dor-type variations, being hotter at minimum, suggesting that the variations

Discovery of hot supergiant stars near the Galactic center,"We report new results of a campaign to find Wolf-Rayet and O (WR/O) stars and
high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the Galactic center. We searched for
candidates by cross-correlating the 2MASS catalog with a deep Chandra catalog
of X-ray point sources in the Radio Arches region. Following up with K-band
spectroscopy, we found two massive stellar counterparts to CXOGC
J174555.3-285126 and CXOGC J174617.0-285131, which we classify as a broad-lined
WR star of sub-type WN6b and an O Ia supergiant, respectively. Their X-ray
properties are most consistent with those of known colliding-wind binaries in
the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud, although a scenario involving
low-rate accretion onto a compact object is also possible. The O Ia star lies
4.4 pc in projection from the Quintuplet cluster, and has a radial velocity
consistent with that of the Quintuplet, suggesting that this star might have
escaped from the cluster. We also present the discovery of a B2 Ia supergiant,
which we identified as a candidate massive star using 8 micron Spitzer maps of
the Galactic center in a region near the known massive X-ray-emitting star
CXOGC J174516.1-290315. We discuss the origin of these stars in the context of
evolving stellar clusters in the Galactic center.",2007-03-08T10:28:10Z
"Spectropolarimetry of the Deep Impact target comet 9P/Tempel 1 with
  HiVIS","Spectropolarimetry of the Deep Impact target, comet 9P/ Tempel 1, was
performed during the impact event on July 4th, 2005 with the HiVIS
Spectropolarimeter and the AEOS 3.67m telescope on Haleakala, Maui. We observed
atypical polarization spectra that changed significantly in the few hours after
the impact. The polarization is sensitive to the geometry, size and composition
of the scattering particles. Our first measurement, beginning 8 minutes after
impact and centered at 6:30UT, showed a polarization of 4% at 650 nm falling to
3% at 950 nm. The next observation, centered an hour later, showed a
polarization of 7% at 650 nm falling to 2% at 950nm. This corresponds to a
spectropolarimetric gradient, or slope, of 0.9% per 1000 Angstroms 40 minutes
after impact, decreasing to a slope of -2.3% per 1000 Angstroms 75 minutes
after impact. Both are atypical blue polarization slopes. The polarization
values of 4% and 7% at 650nm are typical for comets at this scattering angle,
whereas the low polarization of 2% and 3% at 950nm is not. This, combined with
the IR spectroscopy performed by a number of observers during the event,
suggests an increase in size, number, and crystallinity of the individual
silicate particles (monomers) that are a constituant of the dust particles
(aggregates) in the ejecta.",2007-03-13T19:44:32Z
Local scale-invariance in disordered systems,"Dynamical scaling and ageing in disordered systems far from equilibrium is
reviewed. Particular attention is devoted to the question to what extent a
recently introduced generalization of dynamical scaling to local
scale-invariance can describe data for either non-glassy systems quenched to
below $T_c$ or else for spin glasses at criticality. The dependence of the
scaling behaviour on the distribution of the random couplings is discussed. It
is shown that finite-time corrections to scaling can become quite sizable in
these systems. Numerically determined ageing quantities are confronted with
available experimental results.",2007-03-18T13:29:16Z
Secular instability in quasi-viscous disc accretion,"A first-order correction in the $\alpha$-viscosity parameter of Shakura and
Sunyaev has been introduced in the standard inviscid and thin accretion disc. A
linearised time-dependent perturbative study of the stationary solutions of
this ""quasi-viscous"" disc leads to the development of a secular instability on
large spatial scales. This qualitative feature is equally manifest for two
different types of perturbative treatment -- a standing wave on subsonic
scales, as well as a radially propagating wave. Stability of the flow is
restored when viscosity disappears.",2007-03-13T11:29:35Z
"On the efficiency of path sampling methods for the calculation of free
  energies from non-equilibrium simulations","According to the Jarzynski theorem, equilibrium free energy differences can
be calculated from the statistics of work carried out during non-equilibrium
transformations. Although exact, this approach can be plagued by large
statistical errors, particularly for systems driven strongly away from
equilibrium. Recently, several approaches have been suggested to reduce these
errors. In this paper we study the efficiency of these methods using two models
for which analytical solutions exist.",2007-03-07T09:31:05Z
Thermal diffusion by Brownian motion induced fluid stress,"The Ludwig-Soret effect, the migration of a species due to a temperature
gradient, has been extensively studied without a complete picture of its cause
emerging. Here we investigate the dynamics of DNA and spherical particles sub
jected to a thermal gradient using a combination of Brownian dynamics and the
lattice Boltzmann method. We observe that the DNA molecules will migrate to
colder regions of the channel, an observation also made in the experiments of
Duhr, et al[1]. In fact, the thermal diffusion coefficient found agrees
quantitatively with the experimental value. We also observe that the thermal
diffusion coefficient decreases as the radius of the studied spherical
particles increases. Furthermore, we observe that the thermal
fluctuations-fluid momentum flux coupling induces a gradient in the stress
which leads to thermal migration in both systems.",2007-02-08T07:22:37Z
Columnar versus smectic order in systems of charged colloidal rods,"We study the stability of inhomogeneous liquid crystalline states in systems
of monodisperse, stiff, charged rods. By means of a bifurcation analysis
applied to the Onsager free energy for charged rods in strongly nematic states,
we investigate nematic-smectic and nematic-columnar instabilities as a function
of the Debye screening length. While the nematic-smectic transition clearly
pre-emts the nematic-columnar one in the regime of strong screening a marked
stability of hexagonal columnar order is observed at larger screening lengths.
The theoretical results are substantiated by Brownian dynamics computer
simulation results based on the Yukawa-site model. Our findings connect to
experiments on tobacco mosaic virus rods in particular but might be relevant
for soft rod-like mesogens in strong external directional fields in general.",2007-03-27T14:05:45Z
Bandit Algorithms for Tree Search,"Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when
applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go (Gelly et al., 2006). The UCT
algorithm (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), a tree search method based on Upper
Confidence Bounds (UCB) (Auer et al., 2002), is believed to adapt locally to
the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is too
``optimistic'' in some cases, leading to a regret O(exp(exp(D))) where D is the
depth of the tree. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search.
First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales
exponentially with the horizon depth is proven to have a regret O(2^D
\sqrt{n}), but does not adapt to possible smoothness in the tree. We then
analyze Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with
high probability. Then, we introduce a UCB-based Bandit Algorithm for Smooth
Trees which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing
efficient ``cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we
present an incremental tree search version which applies when the full tree is
too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high
probability, essentially only the optimal branches is indefinitely developed.
We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a Lipschitz
function, given noisy data.",2007-03-13T08:53:41Z
Preferential Behaviour and Scaling in Diffusive Dynamics on Networks,"We study the fluctuation properties and return-time statistics on
inhomogeneous scale-free networks using packets moving with two different
dynamical rules; random diffusion and locally navigated diffusive motion with
preferred edges. Scaling in the fluctuations occurs when the dispersion of a
quantity at each node or edge increases like the its mean to the power $\mu$.
We show that the occurrence of scaling in the fluctuations of both the number
of packets passing nodes and the number flowing along edges is related to
preferential behaviour in either the topology (in the case of nodes) or in the
dynamics (in case the of edges). Within our model the absence of any preference
leads to the absence of scaling, and when scaling occurs it is non-universal;
for random diffusion the number of packets passing a node scales with an
exponent $\mu$ which increases continuously with increased acquisition time
window from $\mu =1/2$ at small windows, to $\mu =1$ at long time windows; In
the preferentially navigated diffusive motion, busy nodes and edges have
exponent $\mu =1$, in contrast to less busy parts of the network, where an
exponent $\mu =1/2$ is found. Broad distributions of the return times at nodes
and edges illustrate that the basis of the observed scaling is the cooperative
behaviour between groups of nodes or edges. These conclusions are relevant for
a large class of diffusive dynamics on networks, including packet transport
with local navigation rules.",2007-01-31T16:36:00Z
"Design of Linear-to-Circular Polarization Transformers Made of Long
  Densely Packed Metallic Helices","In this work, we study the realization of realistic polarization transformers
formed by long metallic helices. To this end, we propose a new homogenization
model to characterize the propagation of electromagnetic waves in medium formed
by infinitely long helices. We derive approximate analytical expressions for
the effective permittivity, effective permeability and the magnetoelectric
tensor of the composite material, taking into account the effects of spatial
dispersion. We apply the new homogenization model to characterize novel
linear-to-circular polarization transformers. Our results show that the
metamaterial screen may be designed in such a way that an incoming linearly
polarized wave may be transformed into a circularly polarized transmitted wave,
and that the transmission efficiency of such polarization transformer may be as
high as 95%. The theoretical results are supported by full wave simulations.",2007-01-05T22:57:00Z
Detection of [Ne II] Emission from Young Circumstellar Disks,"We report the detection of [Ne II] emission at 12.81 micron in four out of
the six optically thick dust disks observed as part of the FEPS Spitzer Legacy
program. In addition, we detect a H I(7-6) emission line at 12.37 micron from
the source RXJ1852.3-3700. Detections of [Ne II] lines are favored by low
mid-infrared excess emission. Both stellar X-rays and extreme UV (EUV) photons
can sufficiently ionize the disk surface to reproduce the observed line fluxes,
suggesting that emission from Ne+ originates in the hot disk atmosphere. On the
other hand, the H I(7-6) line is not associated with the gas in the disk
surface and magnetospheric accretion flows can account only for at most ~30% of
the observed flux. We conclude that accretion shock regions and/or the stellar
corona could contribute to most of the H I(7-6)emission. Finally, we discuss
the observations necessary to identify whether stellar X-rays or EUV photons
are the dominant ionization mechanism for Ne atoms. Because the observed [Ne
II] emission probes very small amounts of gas in the disk surface (~10^{-6}
Jupiter masses) we suggest using this gas line to determine the presence or
absence of gas in more evolved circumstellar disks.",2007-03-23T16:49:50Z
Quantum Monte Carlo simulation of spin-polarized H,"The ground-state properties of spin polarized hydrogen H$\downarrow$ are
obtained by means of diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Using the most
accurate to date ab initio H$\downarrow$-H$\downarrow$ interatomic potential we
have studied its gas phase, from the very dilute regime until densities above
its freezing point. At very small densities, the equation of state of the gas
is very well described in terms of the gas parameter $\rho a^3$, with $a$ the
s-wave scattering length. The solid phase has also been studied up to high
pressures. The gas-solid phase transition occurs at a pressure of 173 bar, a
much higher value than suggested by previous approximate descriptions.",2007-02-19T15:42:00Z
"3D Hydrodynamical Simulations of Surface Convection in Red Giant Stars.
  Impact on spectral line formation and abundance analysis","We investigate the impact of 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres of red giant
stars at different metallicities on the formation of spectral lines of a number
of ions and molecules. We carry out realistic 3D simulations of surface
convection in red giant stars with varying stellar parameters. We use the
simulations as time-dependent hydrodynamical model stellar atmospheres to
compute atomic (Li, O, Na, Mg, Ca, Fe) and molecular (CH, NH, OH) spectral
lines under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We compare
the line strengths computed in 3D with the results of analogous line formation
calculations for 1D, hydrostatic, plane-parallel MARCS model atmospheres in
order to estimate the impact of 3D models on the derivation of elemental
abundances. The temperature and density inhomogeneities and correlated
velocities in 3D models, as well as the differences between the 1D and mean 3D
structures significantly affect the predicted line strengths. Under the
assumption of LTE, the low atmospheric temperatures of very metal-poor 3D model
atmospheres cause the lines from neutral species and molecules to appear
stronger than in 1D. Therefore, elemental abundances derived from these lines
using 3D models are significantly lower than according to 1D analyses.
Differences between 3D and 1D abundances of C, N, and O derived from CH, NH,
and OH weak low-excitation lines are found to be in the range -0.5 dex to -1.0
dex for the the red giant stars at [Fe/H]=-3 considered here. At this
metallicity, large negative corrections (about -0.8 dex) are also found for
weak low-excitation Fe I lines. We caution, however, that departures from LTE
might be significant for these and other elements and comparable to the effects
due to stellar granulation.",2007-03-26T15:14:48Z
"Molecular dynamics simulation of rapid solidification of Aluminum under
  pressure","Molecular dynamics simulation study based on the EAM potential is carried out
to investigate the effect of pressure on the rapid solidification of Aluminum.
The radial distribution function is used to characterize the structure of the
Al solidified under different pressures. It is indicated that a high pressure
leads to strong crystallization tendency during cooling.",2007-02-10T15:38:59Z
Stochastic Time-Dependent Current-Density-Functional Theory,"A time-dependent current-density-functional theory for many-particle systems
in interaction with arbitrary external baths is developed. We prove that, given
the initial quantum state $|\Psi_0>$ and the particle-bath interaction
operator, two external vector potentials ${\bf A}({\bf r},t)$ and ${\bf
A}'({\bf r},t)$ that produce the same ensemble-averaged current density,
$\bar{{\bf j}({\bf r},t)}$, must necessarily coincide up to a gauge
transformation. This result greatly expands the applicability of time-dependent
density-functional theory to open quantum systems, and allows for
first-principles calculations of many-particle time evolution beyond
Hamiltonian dynamics.",2007-02-12T07:24:40Z
"Quantum Monte Carlo study of a one-dimensional phase-fluctuating
  condensate","We study numerically the low temperature behavior of a one-dimensional Bose
gas trapped in an optical lattice. For a sufficient number of particles and
weak repulsive interactions, we find a clear regime of temperatures where
density fluctuations are negligible but phase fluctuations are considerable,
i.e., a quasicondensate. In the weakly interacting limit, our results are in
very good agreement with those obtained using a mean-field approximation. In
coupling regimes beyond the validity of mean-field approaches, a
phase-fluctuating condensate also appears, but the phase-correlation properties
are qualitatively different. It is shown that quantum depletion plays an
important role.",2007-01-18T10:28:07Z
"Imaging transverse electron focusing in semiconducting heterostructures
  with spin-orbit coupling","Transverse electron focusing in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) with
strong spin-orbit coupling is revisited. The transverse focusing is related to
the transmission between two contacts at the edge of a 2DEG when a
perpendicular magnetic field is applied. Scanning probe microscopy imaging
techniques can be used to study the electron flow in these systems. Using
numerical techniques we simulate the images that could be obtained in such
experiments. We show that hybrid edge states can be imaged and that the
outgoing flux can be polarized if the microscope tip probe is placed in
specific positions.",2007-03-10T20:08:20Z
Magnification of spin Hall effect in bilayer electron gas,"Spin transport properties of a coupled bilayer electron gas with Rashba
spin-orbit coupling are studied. The definition of the spin currents in each
layer as well as the corresponding continuity-like equations in the bilayer
system are given. The curves of the spin Hall conductivities obtained in each
layer exhibit sharp cusps around a particular value of the tunnelling strength
and the conductivities undergo sign changes across this point. Our
investigation on the impurity effect manifests that an arbitrarily small
concentration of nonmagnetic impurities does not suppress the spin Hall
conductivity to zero in the bilayer system. Based on these features, an
experimental scheme is suggested to detect a magnification of the spin Hall
effect.",2007-02-20T09:51:39Z
"Nanoscale Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for Molecules and Mesoscopic
  Devices in the Strong-Correlation Regime","We develop a nanoscale dynamical mean-field theory (nano-DMFT) to deal with
strong Coulomb interaction effects in physical systems that are intermediate in
size between atoms and bulk materials, taking into account the tunneling into
nearby electrodes. Focusing on a simplified treelike geometry, the usual DMFT
loop simply stops when the finite lattice is fully covered, starting with an
initial seed provided by the electronic environment at the boundary. To
illustrate this nano-DMFT, we investigate the disappearance of the
quasiparticle weight in a correlated nano object near the Mott transition. In
contrast to thermally driven classical phase transitions, quantum effects lead
to unexpected oscillations of the order parameter, related to the interference
of coherent renormalized quasiparticles. This behavior also implies a spatially
inhomogeneous Mott localization process at the nanoscale.",2007-01-29T21:00:08Z
"The superconducting gap in the Hubbard model and the two gap energy
  scales in high-Tc cuprates","Recent excperiments (ARPES, Raman) suggest the presence of two distinct
energy gaps in high-Tc superconductors (HTSC), exhibiting different doping
dependences. Results of a variational cluster approach to the superconducting
state of the two-dimensional Hubbard model are presented which show that this
model qualitatively describes this gap dichotomy: One gap (antinodal) increases
with less doping, a behavior long considered as reflecting the general gap
behavior of the HTSC. On the other hand, the near-nodal gap does even slightly
decrease with underdoping. An explanation of this unexpected behavior is given
which emphasizes the crucial role of spin fluctuations in the pairing
mechanism.",2007-02-16T12:52:57Z
"The short-range three-body phase and other issues impacting the
  observation of Efimov physics in ultracold quantum gases","We discuss several issues important for experimentally observing Efimov
physics in ultracold quantum gases. By numerically solving the three-boson
Schr\""odinger equation over a broad range of scattering lengths and energies,
and by including model potentials with multiple bound states, we address the
complications of relating experimental observations to available analytic
expressions. These more realistic potentials introduce features that can mask
the predicted Efimov physics at small scattering lengths. They also allow us to
verify that positive and negative scattering lengths are universally connected
only across a pole, not across a zero. Additionally, we show that the spacing
between Efimov features for the relatively small scattering lengths accessible
experimentally fail to precisely follow the geometric progression expected for
Efimov physics. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the short-range
three-body physics in determining the position of Efimov features and show that
theoretically reproducing two-body physics is not generally sufficient to
predict three-body properties quantitatively.",2007-03-11T01:25:25Z
"Electrostatic image effects for counter-ions between charged planar
  walls","We study the effect of dielectric inhomogeneities on the interaction between
two planparallel charged surfaces with oppositely charged mobile charges in
between. The dielectric constant between the surfaces is assumed to be
different from the dielectric constant of the two semiinfinite regions bounded
by the surfaces, giving rise to electrostatic image interactions. We show that
on the weak coupling level the image charge effects are generally small, making
their mark only in the second order fluctuation term. However, in the strong
coupling limit, the image effects are large and fundamental. They modify the
interactions between the two surfaces in an essential way. Our calculations are
particularly useful in the regime of parameters where computer simulations
would be difficult and extremely time consuming due to the complicated nature
of the long range image potentials.",2007-02-13T14:11:09Z
Charge inhomogeneity coexisting with large Fermi surfaces,"We discuss how stripes in cuprates can be compatible with a Fermi-liquid-like
Fermi surface and, at the same time, they give rise to a one-dimensional-like
pseudo Fermi surface in the momentum distribution function.",2007-01-12T11:09:46Z
Schrodinger-equation formalism for a dissipative quantum system,"We consider a model dissipative quantum-mechanical system realized by
coupling a quantum oscillator to a semi-infinite classical string which serves
as a means of energy transfer from the oscillator to the infinity and thus
plays the role of a dissipative element. The coupling between the two --
quantum and classical -- parts of the compound system is treated in the spirit
of the mean-field approximation and justification of the validity of such an
approach is given. The equations of motion of the classical subsystem are
solved explicitly and an effective dissipative Schrodinger equation for the
quantum subsystem is obtained. The proposed formalism is illustrated by its
application to two basic problems: the decay of the quasi-stationary state and
the calculation of the nonlinear resonance line shape.",2007-01-09T13:32:47Z
"Exchange-coupling constants, spin density map, and Q dependence of the
  inelastic neutron scattering intensity in single-molecule magnets","The Q dependence of the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) intensity of
transitions within the ground-state spin multiplet of single-molecule magnets
(SMMs) is considered. For these transitions, the Q dependence is related to the
spin density map in the ground state, which in turn is governed by the
Heisenberg exchange interactions in the cluster. This provides the possibility
to infer the exchange-coupling constants from the Q dependence of the INS
transitions within the spin ground state. The potential of this strategy is
explored for the M = +-10 -> +- 9 transition within the S = 10 multiplet of the
molecule Mn12 as an example. The Q dependence is calculated for powder as well
as single-crystal Mn12 samples for various exchange-coupling situations
discussed in the literature. The results are compared to literature data on a
powder sample of Mn12 and to measurements on an oriented array of about 500
single-crystals of Mn12. The calculated Q dependence exhibits significant
variation with the exchange-coupling constants, in particular for a
single-crystal sample, but the experimental findings did not permit an
unambiguous determination. However, although challenging, suitable experiments
are within the reach of today's instruments.",2007-03-23T11:51:15Z
A Numerical Treatment of the Rf SQUID: II. Noise Temperature,"We investigate rf SQUIDs (Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices),
coupled to a resonant input circuit, a readout tank circuit and a preamplifier,
by numerically solving the corresponding Langevin equations and optimizing
model parameters with respect to noise temperature. We also give approximate
analytic solutions for the noise temperature, which we reduce to parameters of
the SQUID and the tank circuit in the absence of the input circuit. The
analytic solutions agree with numerical simulations of the full circuit to
within 10%, and are similar to expressions used to calculate the noise
temperature of dc SQUIDs. The best device performance is obtained when
\beta_L'\equiv 2\pi L I_0\Phi_0 is 0.6 - 0.8; L is the SQUID inductance, I_0
the junction critical current and \Phi_0 the flux quantum. For a tuned input
circuit we find an optimal noise temperature T_{N,opt}\approx 3Tf/f_c, where T,
f and f_c denote temperature, signal frequency and junction characteristic
frequency, respectively. This value is only a factor of 2 larger than the
optimal noise temperatures obtained by approximate analytic theories carried
out previously in the limit \beta_L'<<1. We study the dependence of the noise
temperature on various model parameters, and give examples using realistic
device parameters of the extent to which the intrinsic noise temperature can be
realized experimentally.",2007-01-29T17:51:13Z
The Chemistry of the Local Group,"Simulations of the chemical enrichment histories of ten Local Group (LG)
dwarf galaxies are presented, employing empirically-derived star formation
histories (SFHs), a rich network of isotopic and elemental nucleosynthetic
yields, and a range of prescriptions for supernova (SN)-driven outflows. Our
main conclusions are that (i) neutron-capture element patterns (particularly
that of Ba/Y) suggest a strong contribution from low- and intermediate-mass
stars, (ii) neutron star mergers may play a relatively larger role in the
nucleosynthesis of dwarfs, (iii) SN feedback alone can explain the observed gas
fraction in dwarf irregulars (dIrrs), but dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) require
almost all their gas to be removed via ram pressure and/or tidal stripping,
(iv) the predicted heavy Mg isotope enhancements in the interstellar medium of
dwarfs may provide an alternate solution to claims of a varying fine structure
(v) the gas lost from dwarfs have O,Si/C abundances in broad agreement with
intergalactic medium abundances at redshifts 2<z<4, and (vi) the chemical
properties of dSphs are well-matched by preventing galactic winds from
re-accreting, whilst those of dIrrs are better-matched by incorporating
metallicity-dependent cooling and re-accretion of hot winds. Finally, doubts
are cast upon a claimed association between LG dSph UMaII and High-Velocity
Cloud Complex A.",2007-03-23T12:49:52Z
"Shear zones and wall slip in the capillary flow of concentrated
  colloidal suspensions","We image the flow of a nearly random close packed, hard-sphere colloidal
suspension (a `paste') in a square capillary using confocal microscopy. The
flow consists of a `plug' in the center while shear occurs localized adjacent
to the channel walls, reminiscent of yield-stress fluid behavior. However, the
observed scaling of the velocity profiles with the flow rate strongly contrasts
yield-stress fluid predictions. Instead, the velocity profiles can be captured
by a theory of stress fluctuations originally developed for chute flow of dry
granular media. We verified this behavior both for smooth and rough boundary
conditions.",2007-02-27T18:54:27Z
Renormalization of the Lattice Boltzmann Hierarchy,"Is it possible to solve Boltzmann-type kinetic equations using only a small
number of particles velocities? We introduce a novel techniques of solving
kinetic equations with (arbitrarily) large number of particle velocities using
only a lattice Boltzmann method on standard, low-symmetry lattices. The
renormalized kinetic equation is validated with the exact solution of the
planar Couette flow at moderate Knudsen numbers.",2007-03-16T15:16:34Z
"Effective Field Theory of Triangular-Lattice Three-Spin Interaction
  Model","We discuss an effective field theory of a triangular-lattice three-spin
interaction model defined by the ${\mathbb Z}_p$ variables. Based on the
symmetry properties and the ideal-state graph concept, we show that the vector
dual sine-Gordon model describes the long-distance properties for $p\ge5$; we
then compare its predictions with the previous argument. To provide the
evidences, we numerically analyze the eigenvalue structure of the transfer
matrix for $p=6$, and we check the criticality with the central charge $c=2$ of
the intermediate phase and the quantization condition of the vector charges.",2007-03-15T06:14:22Z
Influence of dimensionality on superconductivity in carbon nanotubes,"We investigate the electronic instabilities in carbon nanotubes (CNs),
looking for the break-down of the one dimensional Luttinger liquid regime due
to the strong screening of the long-range part of the Coulomb repulsion. We
show that such a breakdown is realized both in ultra-small single wall CNs and
multi wall CNs, while a purely electronic mechanism could explain the
superconductivity (SC) observed recently in ultra-small (diameter $ \sim 0.4
nm$) single wall CNs ($T_c\sim 15 ^{o}K$) and entirely end-bonded multi-walled
ones ($T_c\sim 12 ^{o}K$). We show that both the doping and the screening of
long-range part of the electron-electron repulsion, needed to allow the SC
phase, are related to the intrinsically 3D nature of the environment where the
CNs operate.",2007-03-06T08:15:37Z
"MHD simulations of jet acceleration from Keplerian accretion disks: the
  effects of disk resistivity","Accretion disks and astrophysical jets are used to model many active
astrophysical objects, viz., young stars, relativistic stars, and active
galactic nuclei. In this paper we present self-consistent time-dependent
simulations of supersonic jets launched from magnetized accretion disks, using
high resolution numerical techniques. In particular we study the effects of the
disk magnetic resistivity, parametrized through an alpha-prescription, in
determining the properties of the inflow-outflow system. Moreover we analyze
under which conditions steady state solutions of the type proposed in the self
similar models of Blandford and Payne can be reached and maintained in a self
consistent nonlinear stage. We use the resistive MHD FLASH code with adaptive
mesh refinement, allowing us to follow the evolution of the structure for a
time scale long enough to reach steady state. A detailed analysis of the
initial configuration state is given. We obtain the expected solutions in the
axisymmetric (2.5D) limit. Assuming a magnetic field around equipartition with
the thermal pressure of the disk, we show how the characteristics of the disk
jet system, as the ejection efficiency and the energetics, are affected by the
anomalous resistivity acting inside the disk.",2007-03-05T17:59:49Z
Non-equilibrium Phase Transitions with Long-Range Interactions,"This review article gives an overview of recent progress in the field of
non-equilibrium phase transitions into absorbing states with long-range
interactions. It focuses on two possible types of long-range interactions. The
first one is to replace nearest-neighbor couplings by unrestricted Levy flights
with a power-law distribution P(r) ~ r^(-d-sigma) controlled by an exponent
sigma. Similarly, the temporal evolution can be modified by introducing waiting
times Dt between subsequent moves which are distributed algebraically as P(Dt)~
(Dt)^(-1-kappa). It turns out that such systems with Levy-distributed
long-range interactions still exhibit a continuous phase transition with
critical exponents varying continuously with sigma and/or kappa in certain
ranges of the parameter space. In a field-theoretical framework such
algebraically distributed long-range interactions can be accounted for by
replacing the differential operators nabla^2 and d/dt with fractional
derivatives nabla^sigma and (d/dt)^kappa. As another possibility, one may
introduce algebraically decaying long-range interactions which cannot exceed
the actual distance to the nearest particle. Such interactions are motivated by
studies of non-equilibrium growth processes and may be interpreted as Levy
flights cut off at the actual distance to the nearest particle. In the
continuum limit such truncated Levy flights can be described to leading order
by terms involving fractional powers of the density field while the
differential operators remain short-ranged.",2007-02-07T11:05:33Z
Non-resonant microwave absorption studies on MgB2 thin film,"We report on the presence of weak links in the intermetallic superconductor
MgB2 from the non-resonant microwave absorption (NRMA) studies on the MgB2 thin
film. The strong low field signal, which is the characteristics of weak links
and the presence of hysteresis, which arises due to flux trapping, are
observed. The studies are carried out as a function of temperature, microwave
power, magnitude of modulation field and the range of field scan. Presence of
weak links is discussed in terms of increase in the oxygen content of grain
boundaries in the thin film and because of disorder effects arises due to the
aging of the sample. The pinning of flux lines with the changes in sweeping
direction leads to hysteresis in the NRMA signal and shows the contribution of
flux line motion in the power absorption.",2007-02-21T09:16:33Z
Topological Vortex Lines in Two-Gap Superconductor,"Based on the U(1) gauge potential decomposition theory and the $\phi$-mapping
method, we study the vortex lines in two-gap superconductor and obtain the
condition, under which the vortices can carry an arbitrary fraction of magnetic
flux. It has been pointed out that the Chern-Simon action is a topological
invariant, which is just the total sum of all the self-linking numbers and all
the linking numbers of the knot family.",2007-03-19T03:10:58Z
Negative refraction in nonlinear wave systems,"People have been familiar with the phenomenon of wave refraction for several
centuries. Recently, a novel type of refraction, i.e., negative refraction,
where both incident and refractory lines locate on the same side of the normal
line, has been predicted and realized in the context of linear optics in the
presence of both right- and left-handed materials. In this work, we reveal, by
theoretical prediction and numerical verification, negative refraction in
nonlinear oscillatory systems. We demonstrate that unlike what happens in
linear optics, negative refraction of nonlinear waves does not depend on the
presence of the special left-handed material, but depends on suitable physical
condition. Namely, this phenomenon can be observed in wide range of oscillatory
media under the Hopf bifurcation condition. The complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation and a chemical reaction-diffusion model are used to demonstrate the
feasibility of this nonlinear negative refraction behavior in practice.",2007-01-05T12:27:18Z
New boundary conditions for granular fluids,"We present experimental evidence, which contradicts the the standard boundary
conditions used in continuum theories of non-cohesive granular flows for the
velocity normal to a boundary u.n=0, where n points into the fluid. We propose
and experimentally verify a new boundary condition for u.n, based on the
observation that the boundary cannot exert a tension force Fb on the fluid. The
new boundary condition is u.n=0 if Fb.n>=0 else n.P.n=0, where P is the
pressure tensor. This is the analog of cavitation in ordinary fluids, but due
the lack of attractive forces and dissipation it occurs frequently in granular
flows.",2007-03-22T10:11:52Z
On the nature of the phase transition in the itinerant helimagnet MnSi,"A careful study of thermodynamic and transport properties of a high quality
single crystal of MnSi at ambient pressure suggests that its transition to a
helical magnetic state near 29 K is weakly first order. The heat capacity,
temperature derivatives of resistivity, thermal expansion and magnetic
susceptibility exhibit a specific structure around the phase transition point,
interpreted as a combination of first and second order features. Conclusions
drawn from these experiments question prevailing views on the phase diagram of
MnSi and propose that the phase transition under study becomes second order at
high pressure and low temperature.",2007-02-20T13:41:42Z
Enhancing the conductance of a two-electron nanomechanical oscillator,"We consider electron transport through a mobile island (i.e., a
nanomechanical oscillator) which can accommodate one or two excess electrons
and show that, in contrast to immobile islands, the Coulomb blockade peaks,
associated with the first and second electrons entering the island, have
different functional dependences on the nano-oscillator parameters when the
island coupling to its leads is asymmetric. In particular, the conductance for
the second electron (i.e., when the island is already charged) is greatly
enhanced in comparison to the conductance of the first electron in the presence
of an external electric field. We also analyze the temperature dependence of
the two conduction peaks and show that these exhibit different functional
behaviors.",2007-02-09T11:15:58Z
Nuclear spin effects in singly negatively charged InP quantum dots,"Experimental investigation of nuclear spin effects on the electron spin
polarization in singly negatively charged InP quantum dots is reported.
Pump-probe photoluminescence measurements of electron spin relaxation in the
microsecond timescale are used to estimate the time-period $T_{N}$ of the
Larmor precession of nuclear spins in the hyperfine field of electrons. We find
$T_{N}$ to be $\sim 1$ $\mu$s at $T \approx 5$ K, under the vanishing external
magnetic field. From the time-integrated measurements of electron spin
polarization as a function of a longitudinally applied magnetic field at $T
\approx 5$ K, we find that the Overhauser field appearing due to the dynamic
nuclear polarization increases linearly with the excitation power, though its
magnitude remains smaller than 10 mT up to the highest excitation power (50 mW)
used in these experiments. The effective magnetic field of the frozen
fluctuations of nuclear spins is found to be 15 mT, independent of the
excitation power.",2007-02-03T05:08:15Z
"Balancing torques in membrane-mediated interactions: Exact results and
  numerical illustrations","Torques on interfaces can be described by a divergence-free tensor which is
fully encoded in the geometry. This tensor consists of two terms, one
originating in the couple of the stress, the other capturing an intrinsic
contribution due to curvature. In analogy to the description of forces in terms
of a stress tensor, the torque on a particle can be expressed as a line
integral along any contour surrounding the particle. Interactions between
particles mediated by a fluid membrane are studied within this framework. In
particular, torque balance places a strong constraint on the shape of the
membrane. Symmetric two-particle configurations admit simple analytical
expressions which are valid in the fully nonlinear regime; in particular, the
problem may be solved exactly in the case of two membrane-bound parallel
cylinders. This apparently simple system provides some flavor of the remarkably
subtle nonlinear behavior associated with membrane-mediated interactions.",2007-02-14T17:10:05Z
"The reversal of the star formation-density relation in the distant
  universe","We study the relationship between the local environment of galaxies and their
star formation rate (SFR) in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey,
GOODS, at z~1, from ultradeep imaging at 24 microns with the MIPS camera
onboard Spitzer. We show that the star formation-density relation observed
locally was reversed at z~1: the average SFR of an individual galaxy increased
with local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age.
Hierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the Millennium
model) predicted such a reversal to occur only at only at earlier epochs (z>2)
and at a lower level. We present a remarkable structure at z~1.016, containing
X-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a
Virgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of
galaxies increases with density at the ~1-2 Mpc scale. The SFR of z~1 galaxies
is found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role in
the observed star formation-density trend. However the specific SFR (=SFR/M*)
decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, which
implies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activity
of galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major cause
for this effect since nearly half (46%) of the luminous infrared galaxies
(LIRGs) at z~1 present the HST-ACS morphology of spirals, while only a third
present a clear signature of major mergers. The remaining galaxies are divided
into compact (9%) and irregular (14%) galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of
major mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals. Reproducing the
SFR-density relation at z ~ 1 is a new challenge for models, requiring a
correct balance between mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs.",2007-03-26T15:31:06Z
Density-functional formulations for quantum chains,"We show that a lattice formulation of density-functional theory (DFT), guided
by renormalization-group concepts, can be used to obtain numerical predictions
of energy gaps, spin-density profiles, critical exponents, sound velocities,
surface energies and conformal anomalies of spatially inhomogeneous quantum
spin chains. To this end we (i) cast the formalism of DFT in the notation of
quantum-spin chains, to make the powerful methods and concepts developed in
{\em ab initio} DFT available to workers in this field; (ii) explore to what
extent simple local approximations in the spirit of the local-density
approximation (LDA), can be used to predict critical exponents and conformal
anomalies of quantum spin models; (iii) propose and explore various nonlocal
approximations, depending on the size of the system, or on its average density
in addition to the local density. These nonlocal functionals turn out to be
superior to LDA functionals.",2007-02-05T17:38:53Z
"Polymer translocation through a nanopore - a showcase of anomalous
  diffusion","The translocation dynamics of a polymer chain through a nanopore in the
absence of an external driving force is analyzed by means of scaling arguments,
fractional calculus, and computer simulations. The problem at hand is mapped on
a one dimensional {\em anomalous} diffusion process in terms of reaction
coordinate $s$ (i.e. the translocated number of segments at time $t$) and shown
to be governed by an universal exponent $\alpha = 2/(2\nu+2-\gamma_1)$ whose
value is nearly the same in two- and three-dimensions. The process is described
by a {\em fractional} diffusion equation which is solved exactly in the
interval $0 <s < N$ with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. The
solution gives the probability distribution of translocation times as well as
the variation with time of the statistical moments: $<s(t)>$, and $<s^2(t)> - <
s(t)>^2$ which provide full description of the diffusion process. The
comparison of the analytic results with data derived from extensive Monte Carlo
(MC) simulations reveals very good agreement and proves that the diffusion
dynamics of unbiased translocation through a nanopore is anomalous in its
nature.",2007-01-26T17:01:27Z
Loschmidt echoes in two-body random matrix ensembles,"Fidelity decay is studied for quantum many-body systems with a dominant
independent particle Hamiltonian resulting e.g. from a mean field theory with a
weak two-body interaction. The diagonal terms of the interaction are included
in the unperturbed Hamiltonian, while the off-diagonal terms constitute the
perturbation that distorts the echo. We give the linear response solution for
this problem in a random matrix framework. While the ensemble average shows no
surprising behavior, we find that the typical ensemble member as represented by
the median displays a very slow fidelity decay known as ``freeze''. Numerical
calculations confirm this result and show, that the ground state even on
average displays the freeze. This may contribute to explanation of the
``unreasonable'' success of mean field theories.",2007-02-05T17:42:36Z
"The Corot Book: Chap. V.5/ Extraction of the photometric information :
  corrections","We present here the set of corrections that will be applied to the raw data
of the CoRoT mission. The aim is to correct the data for instrumental and
environmental perturbations as well as to optimize the duty-cycle, in order to
reach the expected performances of the mission. The main corrections are : the
correction of the electromagnetic interferences, suppression of outliers, the
background correction, the jitter correction and the correction of the
integration time variations. We focus here on these corrections and emphasize
their efficiency.",2007-03-14T11:33:57Z
Crossover in the Slow Decay of Dynamic Correlations in the Lorentz Model,"The long-time behavior of transport coefficients in a model for spatially
heterogeneous media in two and three dimensions is investigated by Molecular
Dynamics simulations. The behavior of the velocity auto-correlation function is
rationalized in terms of a competition of the critical relaxation due to the
underlying percolation transition and the hydrodynamic power-law anomalies. In
two dimensions and in the absence of a diffusive mode, another power law
anomaly due to trapping is found with an exponent -3 instead of -2. Further,
the logarithmic divergence of the Burnett coefficient is corroborated in the
dilute limit; at finite density, however, it is dominated by stronger
divergences.",2007-01-26T16:23:38Z
"Carbon Rich Extremely Metal Poor Stars: Signatures of Population-III AGB
  stars in Binary Systems","We use the Cambridge stellar evolution code STARS to model the evolution and
nucleosynthesis of zero-metallicity intermediate-mass stars. We investigate the
effect of duplicity on the nucleosynthesis output of these systems and the
potential abundances of the secondaries. The surfaces of zero-metallicity stars
are enriched in CNO elements after second dredge up. During binary interaction,
such as Roche lobe overflow or wind accretion, metals can be released from
these stars and the secondaries enriched in CNO isotopes. We investigate the
formation of the two most metal poor stars known, HE 0107-5240 and HE
1327-2326. The observed carbon and nitrogen abundances of HE 0107-5240 can be
reproduced by accretion of material from the companion-enhanced wind of a seven
solar star after second dredge-up, though oxygen and sodium are underproduced.
We speculate that HE 1327-2326, which is richer in nitrogen and strontium, may
similarly be formed by wind accretion in a later AGB phase after third
dredge-up.",2007-03-27T14:07:46Z
"Density matrices for finite segments of Heisenberg chains of arbitrary
  length","We derive a multiple integral representing the ground state density matrix of
a segment of length $m$ of the XXZ spin chain on $L$ lattice sites, which
depends on $L$ only parametrically. This allows us to treat chains of arbitrary
finite length. Specializing to the isotropic limit of the XXX chain we show for
small $m$ that the multiple integrals factorize. We conjecture that this
property holds for arbitrary $m$ and suggest an exponential formula for the
density matrix which involves only a double Cauchy type integral in the
exponent. We demonstrate the efficiency of our formula by computing the
next-to-nearest neighbour $zz$-correlation function for chain lengths ranging
from two to macroscopic numbers.",2007-01-18T20:48:49Z
"Long range diffusion noise in platinum micro-wires with metallic
  adhesion layers","Voltage fluctuations of Platinum wires hosted by silicon nitride beams were
investigated. We considered four variants of the wires: three with an adhesion
layer and one with no adhesion layer. We found that the presence of an adhesion
layer changes the nature of the power spectrum which is $1/f$ for wires with no
adhesion layers and $1/f^{3/2}$ for wires with an adhesion layer. We attribute
the value of the exponent $\alpha=3/2$ to the long range diffusion of hydrogen
originating from adhesion layers that undergo a migration through the Pt wires.",2007-03-22T13:44:41Z
Fermi-Bose mixture across a Feshbach resonance,"We study a dilute mixture of degenerate bosons and fermions across a Feshbach
resonance of the Fermi-Fermi scattering length $a_F$. This scattering length is
renormalized by the boson-induced interaction between fermions and its value is
crucial to determine the phase diagram of the system. For the mixture in a box
and a positive Bose-Fermi scattering length, we show that there are three
possibilities: a single uniform mixed phase, a purely fermionic phase
coexisting with a mixed phase, and a purely fermionic phase coexisting with a
purely bosonic one. As $1/a_F$ is increased from a negative value to the
Feshbach resonance ($1/a_F=0$) the region of pure separation increases and the
other two regions are strongly reduced. Above the Feshbach resonance
($1/a_F>0$), pairs of Fermi atoms become Bose-condensed molecules. We find that
these molecules are fully spatially separated from the bosonic atoms when
$1/a_F$ exceedes a critical value. For a negative Bose-Fermi scattering length
we deduce the condition for collapse, which coincides with the onset of
dynamical instability of the fully mixed phase. We consider also the mixture in
a harmonic trap and determine the conditions for partial demixing, full
demixing and collapse. The experimental implications of our results are
investigated by analyzing mixtures of $^6$Li--$^{23}$Na and $^{40}$K--$^{87}$Rb
atoms.",2007-01-05T11:21:45Z
Mathematical model of interest matchmaking in electronic social networks,"The problem of matchmaking in electronic social networks is formulated as an
optimization problem. In particular, a function measuring the matching degree

is proposed.",2007-03-23T12:42:20Z
Two Anderson Impurity problem: Kondo-doublets beyond the Kondo Limit,"We analyze the effects of high energy configurations on the Kondo-doublet
interaction between two Anderson impurities. We found that the Kondo doublet
states are robust and that their coherence energy is incremented by the
inclusion of high energy configurations. Analytic expressions are obtained for
the corrections near the Kondo limit. Analysis of the system in the
intermediate valence regime shows that the behavior of the system can be
changed from ferromagnetic to sligthy antiferromagnetic by tuning the system
parameters; this regime can also be used to study the interplay between
hole-driven and electron-driven coherence effects.",2007-03-20T20:02:10Z
"Post-Newtonian gravitational radiation and equations of motion via
  direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations. IV. Radiation reaction
  for binary systems with spin-spin coupling","Using post-Newtonian equations of motion for fluid bodies that include
radiation-reaction terms at 2.5 and 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order O[(v/c)^5]
and O[(v/c)^7] beyond Newtonian order), we derive the equations of motion for
binary systems with spinning bodies, including spin-spin effects. In particular
we determine the effects of radiation-reaction coupled to spin-spin effects on
the two-body equations of motion, and on the evolution of the spins. We find
that radiation damping causes a 3.5PN order, spin-spin induced precession of
the individual spins. This contrasts with the case of spin-orbit coupling,
where there is no effect on the spins at 3.5PN order. Employing the equations
of motion and of spin precession, we verify that the loss of total energy and
total angular momentum induced by spin-spin effects precisely balances the
radiative flux of those quantities calculated by Kidder et al.",2007-01-08T00:52:21Z
"On the critical weight statistics of the Random Energy Model and of the
  Directed Polymer on the Cayley Tree","We consider the critical point of two mean-field disordered models : (i) the
Random Energy Model (REM), introduced by Derrida as a mean-field spin-glass
model of $N$ spins (ii) the Directed Polymer of length $N$ on a Cayley Tree
(DPCT) with random bond energies. Both models are known to exhibit a freezing
transition between a high temperature phase where the entropy is extensive and
a low-temperature phase of finite entropy. In this paper, we study the weight
statistics at criticality via the entropy $S=-\sum w_i \ln w_i$ and the
generalized moments $Y_k=\sum w_i^k$, where the $w_i$ are the Boltzmann weights
of the $2^N$ configurations. In the REM, we find that the critical weight
statistics is governed by the finite-size exponent $\nu=2$ : the entropy scales
as $\bar{S}_N(T_c) \sim N^{1/2}$, the typical values $e^{\bar{\ln Y_k}}$ decay
as $N^{-k/2}$, and the disorder-averaged values $\bar{Y_k}$ are governed by
rare events and decay as $N^{-1/2}$ for any $k>1$. For the DPCT, we find that
the entropy scales similarly as $\bar{S}_N(T_c) \sim N^{1/2}$, whereas another
exponent $\nu'=1$ governs the $Y_k$ statistics : the typical values
$e^{\bar{\ln Y_k}}$ decay as $N^{-k}$, the disorder-averaged values $\bar{Y_k}$
decay as $N^{-1}$ for any $k>1$. As a consequence, the asymptotic probability
distribution $\bar{\pi}_{N=\infty}(q)$ of the overlap $q$, beside the delta
function $\delta(q)$ which bears the whole normalization, contains an isolated
point at $q=1$, as a memory of the delta peak $(1-T/T_c) \delta(q-1)$ of the
low-temperature phase $T<T_c$. The associated value $\bar{\pi}_{N=\infty}(q=1)$
is finite for the DPCT, and diverges as $\bar{\pi}_{N=\infty}(q=1) \sim
N^{1/2}$ for the REM.",2007-03-01T08:41:53Z
"Nanometer scale electronic reconstruction at the interface between LaVO3
  and LaVO4","Electrons at interfaces, driven to minimize their free energy, are
distributed differently than in bulk. This can be dramatic at interfaces
involving heterovalent compounds. Here we profile an abrupt interface between V
3d2 LaVO3 and V 3d0 LaVO4 using electron energy loss spectroscopy. Although no
bulk phase of LaVOx with a V 3d1 configuration exists, we find a nanometer-wide
region of V 3d1 at the LaVO3/LaVO4 interface, rather than a mixture of V 3d0
and V 3d2. The two-dimensional sheet of 3d1 electrons is a prototypical
electronic reconstruction at an interface between competing ground states.",2007-01-04T17:42:38Z
"22nd order high-temperature expansion of nearest-neighbor models with
  O(2) symmetry on a simple cubic lattice","We present the high-temperature series for a nearest-neighbor model with O(2)
symmetry on a simple cubic lattice with the most general single-site potential.
In particular, the magnetic susceptibility and the second-moment correlation
length are computed to 22nd order. The series specialized to some particular
improved Hamiltonians have been already analyzed in the paper M. Campostrini,
M. Hasenbusch, A. Pelissetto, and E. Vicari, Phys. Rev. B 74, 144506 (2006)

quantities of the three-dimensional XY universality class.",2007-01-04T07:42:15Z
Species-specific optical lattices,"We examine single-frequency optical schemes for species-selective trapping of
ultracold alkali-metal atoms. Independently addressing the elements of a binary
mixture enables the creation of an optical lattice for one atomic species with
little or no effect on the other. We analyze a ""tune-in"" scheme, using
near-resonant detuning to create a stronger potential for one specific element.
A ""tune-out"" scheme is also developed, in which the trapping wavelength is
chosen to lie between two strong transitions of an alkali-metal atom such that
the induced dipole moment is zero for that species but is nonzero for any
other. We compare these schemes by examining the trap depths and heating rates
associated with both. We find that the tune-in scheme is preferable for Li-Na,
Li-K, and K-Na mixtures, while the tune-out scheme is preferable for Li-Cs,
K-Rb, Rb-Cs, K-Cs and 39K-40K mixtures. Several applications of
species-selective optical lattices are explored, including the creation of a
lattice for a single species in the presence of a phononlike background, the
tuning of relative effective mass, and the isothermal increase of phase space
density.",2007-02-02T16:46:03Z
"Accurate Modelling of Left-Handed Metamaterials Using Finite-Difference
  Time-Domain Method with Spatial Averaging at the Boundaries","The accuracy of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modelling of left-handed
metamaterials (LHMs) is dramatically improved by using an averaging technique
along the boundaries of LHM slabs. The material frequency dispersion of LHMs is
taken into account using auxiliary differential equation (ADE) based dispersive
FDTD methods. The dispersive FDTD method with averaged permittivity along the
material boundaries is implemented for a two-dimensional (2-D) transverse
electric (TE) case. A mismatch between analytical and numerical material
parameters (e.g. permittivity and permeability) introduced by the time
discretisation in FDTD is demonstrated. The expression of numerical
permittivity is formulated and it is suggested to use corrected permittivity in
FDTD simulations in order to model LHM slabs with their desired parameters. The
influence of switching time of source on the oscillation of field intensity is
analysed. It is shown that there exists an optimum value which leads to fast
convergence in simulations.",2007-02-06T15:53:35Z
"Extreme fluctuations in noisy task-completion landscapes on scale-free
  networks","We study the statistics and scaling of extreme fluctuations in noisy
task-completion landscapes, such as those emerging in synchronized
distributed-computing networks, or generic causally-constrained queuing
networks, with scale-free topology. In these networks the average size of the
fluctuations becomes finite (synchronized state) and the extreme fluctuations
typically diverge only logarithmically in the large system-size limit ensuring
synchronization in a practical sense. Provided that local fluctuations in the
network are short-tailed, the statistics of the extremes are governed by the
Gumbel distribution. We present large-scale simulation results using the exact
algorithmic rules, supported by mean-field arguments based on a coarse-grained
description.",2007-01-13T21:34:30Z
"Density dependent exchange contribution to $\partialμ/\partial n$ in
  extrinsic graphene","We calculate $\partial\mu/\partial n$ in extrinsic graphene as a function of
carrier density $n$ at zero temperature by obtaining the electronic self-energy
within the Hartree-Fock approximation. The exchange-driven Dirac-point
logarithmic singularity in the quasiparticle velocity of intrinsic graphene
disappears in the extrinsic case. The calculated renormalized
$\partial\mu/\partial n$ in extrinsic graphene has the same qualitative
$n^{-\frac12}$ density dependence as the inverse bare density of states with a
20% enhancement from the corresponding bare value, a relatively weak effect
compared to the corresponding parabolic-band case.",2007-03-20T01:32:27Z
Characterization of the Schottky Barrier in SrRuO3/Nb:SrTiO3 Junctions,"Internal photoemission spectroscopy was used to determine the Schottky
barrier height in rectifying SrRuO3/Nb-doped SrTiO3 junctions for 0.01 wt % and
0.5 wt % Nb concentrations. Good agreement was obtained with the barrier height
deduced from capacitance-voltage measurements, provided that a model of the
nonlinear permittivity of SrTiO3 was incorporated in extrapolating the built-in
potential, particularly for high Nb concentrations. Given the generic
polarizability of perovskites under internal/external electric fields, internal
photoemission provides a valuable independent probe of the interface electronic
structure.",2007-03-14T06:07:23Z
"Effects of correlated disorder on the magnetism of double exchange
  systems","We study the effects of short-range correlated disorder arising from chemical
dopants or local lattice distortions, on the ferromagnetism of 3d double
exchange systems. For this, we integrate out the carriers and treat the
resulting disordered spin Hamiltonian within local random phase approximation,
whose reliability is shown by direct comparison with Monte Carlo simulations.
We find large scale inhomogeneities in the charge, couplings and spin
densities. Compared with the homogeneous case, we obtain larger Curie
temperatures ($T_{C}$) and very small spin stiffnesses ($D$). As a result,
large variations of $\frac{D}{T_{C}}$ measured in manganites may be explained
by correlated disorder. This work also provides a microscopic model for
Griffiths phases in double exchange systems.",2007-02-27T14:07:09Z
"Quantum disordering of the 111 state and the compressible-incompressible
  transition in quantum Hall bilayer systems","We systematically discuss properties of quantum disordered states of the
quantum Hall bilayer at \nu_T = 1. For one of them, so-called vortex metal
state, we find ODLRO (off-diagonal long-range order) of algebraic kind, and
derive its transport properties. It is shown that this state is relevant for
the explanation of the ""imperfect"" superfluid behavior, and persistent
intercorrelations, for large distances between layers, that were found in
experiments.",2007-02-02T09:23:06Z
Comparison of different spectral population models,"We have compared simple stellar populations (SSPs) generated with different
population synthesis tools: BC03, Vazdekis and Pegase.HR and different stellar
libraries: ELODIE3.1, SteLib and MILES. We find that BC03/SteLib SSPs are
biased toward solar metallicity, however Pegase.HR/ELODIE3.1 and Vazdekis/MILES
are extremely consistent. The extensive coverage of the space of atmospheric
parameters in the large stellar libraries allows precise synthesis for a large
range of ages (0.1 .. 10 Gyr) and metallicities (-2 .. +0.4 dex) limited by the
quality of the determination of stellar parameters (like temperature scale of
the giants).",2007-03-06T21:04:58Z
"Exotic gapless spectrum induced by frustration in quantum
  antiferromagnets","We show strong numerical evidence in favor of an unexpected virtually gapless
spectrum, with edge states localized at the boundaries, in frustrated spin-1/2
antiferromagnetic ladders with an odd number of legs. These features can be
accurately reproduced by using a projected BCS wave function with a non-trivial
pairing, that mixes even and odd reflection symmetries. This approach gives the
correct classification of the excitations and provides a simple and very
appealing picture of an unconventional spin-liquid phase stabilized by
frustration.",2007-01-26T15:52:16Z
"Adiabatic quantum computation with flux qubits, first experimental
  results","Controllable adiabatic evolution of a multi-qubit system can be used for
adiabatic quantum computation (AQC). This evolution ends at a configuration
where the Hamiltonian of the system encodes the solution of the problem to be
solved. As a first steps towards realization of AQC we have investigated two,
three and four flux qubit systems. These systems were characterized by making
use of a radio-frequency method. We designed two-qubit systems with coupling
energies up to several kelvins. For the three-flux-qubit systems we determined
the complete ground-state flux diagram in the three dimensional flux space
around the qubits common degeneracy point. We show that the system`s
Hamiltonian can be completely reconstructed from our measurements. Our concept
for the implementation of AQC, by making use of flux qubits, is discussed.",2007-02-25T21:59:30Z
Comments to topological defects in bilayer vesicles,"To explain the details of bilayer vesicle aggregation, we revised the anyon

"Electrothermal flow in Dielectrophoresis of Single-Walled Carbon
  Nanotubes","We theoretically investigate the impact of the electrothermal flow on the
dielectrophoretic separation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). The
electrothermal flow is observed to control the motions of semiconducting SWNTs
in a sizeable domain near the electrodes under typical experimental conditions,
therefore helping the dielectrophoretic force to attract semiconducting SWNTs
in a broader range. Moreover, with the increase of the surfactant
concentration, the electrothermal flow is enhanced, and with the change of
frequency, the pattern of the electrothermal flow changes. It is shown that
under some typical experimental conditions of dielectrophoresis separation of
SWNTs, the electrothermal flow is a dominating factor in determining the motion
of SWNTs.",2007-02-23T14:48:37Z
Beta-NMR of Isolated Lithium in Nearly Ferromagnetic Palladium,"The temperature dependence of the frequency shift and spin-lattice relaxation
rate of isolated, nonmagnetic Li-8 impurities implanted in a nearly
ferromagnetic host (Pd) are measured by means of beta-detected nuclear magnetic
resonance (b-NMR). The shift is negative, very large and increases
monotonically with decreasing T in proportion to the bulk susceptibility of Pd
for T > T*~ 100 K. Below T*, an additional shift occurs which we attribute to
the response of Pd to the defect. The relaxation rate is much slower than
expected for the large shift and is linear with T below T*, showing no sign of
additional relaxation mechanisms associated with the defect.",2007-01-17T01:23:08Z
Lattice dynamics and electron-phonon coupling in Sr2RuO4,"The lattice dynamics in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been studied by inelastic neutron
scattering combined with shell-model calculations. The in-plane bond-stretching
modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ exhibit a normal dispersion in contrast to all
electronically doped perovskites studied so far. Evidence for strong electron
phonon coupling is found for c-polarized phonons suggesting a close connection
with the anomalous c-axis charge transport in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.",2007-02-13T10:07:09Z
A Delta Debugger for ILP Query Execution,"Because query execution is the most crucial part of Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP) algorithms, a lot of effort is invested in developing faster
execution mechanisms. These execution mechanisms typically have a low-level
implementation, making them hard to debug. Moreover, other factors such as the
complexity of the problems handled by ILP algorithms and size of the code base
of ILP data mining systems make debugging at this level a very difficult job.
In this work, we present the trace-based debugging approach currently used in
the development of new execution mechanisms in hipP, the engine underlying the
ACE Data Mining system. This debugger uses the delta debugging algorithm to
automatically reduce the total time needed to expose bugs in ILP execution,
thus making manual debugging step much lighter.",2007-01-17T13:35:35Z
Limited path percolation in complex networks,"We study the stability of network communication after removal of $q=1-p$
links under the assumption that communication is effective only if the shortest
path between nodes $i$ and $j$ after removal is shorter than $a\ell_{ij}
(a\geq1)$ where $\ell_{ij}$ is the shortest path before removal. For a large
class of networks, we find a new percolation transition at
$\tilde{p}_c=(\kappa_o-1)^{(1-a)/a}$, where $\kappa_o\equiv < k^2>/< k>$ and
$k$ is the node degree. Below $\tilde{p}_c$, only a fraction $N^{\delta}$ of
the network nodes can communicate, where $\delta\equiv a(1-|\log
p|/\log{(\kappa_o-1)}) < 1$, while above $\tilde{p}_c$, order $N$ nodes can
communicate within the limited path length $a\ell_{ij}$. Our analytical results
are supported by simulations on Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and scale-free network
models. We expect our results to influence the design of networks, routing
algorithms, and immunization strategies, where short paths are most relevant.",2007-02-28T18:52:31Z
Crystal Shapes and Phase Equilibria: A Common Mathematical Basis,"Geometrical constructions, such as the tangent construction on the molar free
energy for determining whether a particular composition of a solution, is
stable, are related to similar tangent constructions on the
orientation-dependent interfacial energy for determining stable interface
orientations and on the orientation dependence of the crystal growth rate which
tests whether a particular orientation appears on a growing crystal. Subtle
differences in the geometric constructions for the three fields arise from the
choice of a metric (unit of measure). Using results from studies of extensive
and convex functions we demonstrate that there is a common mathematical
structure for these three disparate topics, and use this to find new uses for
well-known graphical methods for all three topics. Thus the use of chemical
potentials for solution thermodynamics is very similar to known vector
formulations for surface thermodynamics, and the method of characteristics
which tracks the interfaces of growing crystals; the Gibbs-Duhem equation is
analogous to the Cahn-Hoffman equation. The Wulff construction for equilibrium
crystal shapes can be modified to construct a ``phase shape'' from solution
free energies that is a potentially useful method of numerical calculations of
phase diagrams from known thermodynamical data.",2007-03-21T22:53:49Z
"Slave bosons in radial gauge: a bridge between path integral and
  hamiltonian language","We establish a correspondence between the resummation of world lines and the
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian for a strongly correlated electronic system.
For this purpose, we analyze the functional integrals for the partition
function and the correlation functions invoking a slave boson representation in
the radial gauge. We show in the spinless case that the Green's function of the
physical electron and the projected Green's function of the pseudofermion
coincide. Correlation and Green's functions in the spinful case involve a
complex entanglement of the world lines which, however, can be obtained through
a strikingly simple extension of the spinless scheme. As a toy model we
investigate the two-site cluster of the single impurity Anderson model which
yields analytical results. All expectation values and dynamical correlation
functions are obtained from the exact calculation of the relevant functional
integrals. The hole density, the hole auto-correlation function and the Green's
function are computed, and a comparison between spinless and spin 1/2 systems
provides insight into the role of the radial slave boson field. In particular,
the exact expectation value of the radial slave boson field is finite in both
cases, and it is not related to a Bose condensate.",2007-01-25T17:39:14Z
A new detached K7 dwarf eclipsing binary system,"We present an analysis of a new, detached, double-lined eclipsing binary
system with K7 Ve components, discovered as part of the University of New South
Wales Extrasolar Planet Search. The object is significant in that only 6 other
binary systems are known with comparable or lower mass. Such systems offer
important tests of mass-radius theoretical models. Follow-up photometry and
spectroscopy were obtained with the 40-inch and 2.3m telescopes at SSO
respectively. An estimate of the radial velocity amplitude from spectral
absorption features, combined with the orbital inclination (83.5 deg) estimated
from lightcurve fitting, yielded a total mass of M=(1.041 +/- 0.06)M_sun and
component masses of M_A=(0.529 +/- 0.035)M_sun and M_B=(0.512 +/- 0.035)M_sun.
The radial velocity amplitude estimated from absorption features (167 +/-
3)kmps was found to be less than the estimate from the H_alpha emission lines
(175 +/- 1.5)kmps. The lightcurve fit produced radii of R_A=(0.641 +/-
0.05)R_sun and R_B=(0.608 +/- 0.06)R_sun, and a temperature ratio of
T_B/T_A=0.980 +/- 0.015. The apparent magnitude of the binary was estimated to
be V=13.9 +/- 0.2. Combined with the spectral type, this gave the distance to
the binary as 169 +/- 14 pc. The timing of the secondary eclipse gave a lower
limit on the eccentricity of the binary system of 0.0025 +/- 0.0005. This is
the most statistically significant non-zero eccentricity found for such a
system, possibly suggesting the presence of a third companion.",2007-03-22T05:08:55Z
"Strong-field effects in the Rabi oscillations of the superconducting
  phase qubit","Rabi oscillations have been observed in many superconducting devices, and
represent prototypical logic operations for quantum bits (qubits) in a quantum
computer. We use a three-level multiphoton analysis to understand the behavior
of the superconducting phase qubit (current-biased Josephson junction) at high
microwave drive power. Analytical and numerical results for the ac Stark shift,
single-photon Rabi frequency, and two-photon Rabi frequency are compared to
measurements made on a dc SQUID phase qubit with Nb/AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions.
Good agreement is found between theory and experiment.",2007-03-02T22:27:09Z
"Spitzer Observations of M83 and the Hot Star, H II Region Connection","We have undertaken a program to observe emission lines of SIV 10.5, NeII
12.8, NeIII 15.6, & SIII 18.7 um in a number of extragalactic HII regions with
the Spitzer Space Telescope. We report our results for the nearly face-on
spiral galaxy M83. The nebulae selected cover a wide range of galactocentric
radii (R_G). The observations were made with the Infrared Spectrograph in the
short wavelength, high dispersion configuration. The above set of 4 lines is
observed cospatially, thus permitting a reliable comparison of the fluxes. From
the measured fluxes, we determine the ionic abundance ratios including
Ne++/Ne+, S3+/S++, and S++/Ne+ and find that there is a correlation of
increasingly higher ionization with larger R_G. By sampling the dominant
ionization states of Ne and S for HII regions, Ne/S ~ (Ne+ + Ne++)/(S++ + S3+).
Our findings of ratios that exceed the benchmark Orion value are more likely
due to other effects than a true gradient in Ne/S. Both Ne and S are primary
elements produced in alpha- chain reactions. It is expected that Ne/S remains
relatively constant throughout a galaxy. This type of observation and method of
analysis has the potential for accurate measurements of Ne/S, particularly for
HII regions with lower metallicity & higher ionization than those here, such as
those in M33. Our observations may also be used to test the predicted ionizing
spectral energy distribution of various stellar atmosphere models. We compare
the fractional ionization ratios <Ne++>/<S++> & <Ne++>/<S3+> vs. <S3+>/<S++>
with predictions made from our photoionization models using several
state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere model grids. A second paper using Spitzer
observations of HII regions in the galaxy M33 will follow.",2007-03-09T20:03:35Z
"Exact analytical evaluation of time dependent transmission coefficient
  from the method of reactive flux for an inverted parabolic barrier","In this paper we derive a general expression for the transmission coefficient
using the method of reactive flux for a particle coupled to a harmonic bath
surmounting a one dimensional inverted parabolic barrier. Unlike Kohen and
Tannor [J. Chem. Phys. 103, 6013 (1995)] we use a normal mode analysis where
the unstable and the other modes have a complete physical meaning. Importantly
our approach results a very general expression for the time dependent
transmission coefficient not restricted to overdamped limit. Once the spectral
density for the problem is know one can use our formula to evaluate the time
dependent transmission coefficient. We have done the calculations with time
dependent friction used by Xie [Phys. Rev. Lett 93, 180603 (2004)] and also the
one used by Kohen and Tannor [J. Chem. Phys. 103, 6013 (1995)]. Like the
formula of Kohen and Tannor our formula also reproduces the results of
transition state theory as well as the Kramers theory in the limits t->0 and
t->infinity respectively.",2007-01-05T07:10:20Z
"Reversible Ferromagnetic Switching in Zno:(Co,Mn) Powders","We report here on the magnetic properties of ZnO:Mn and ZnO:Co doped
nanoparticles. We have found that the ferromagnetism of ZnO:Mn can be switched
on and off by consecutive low-temperature annealings in O2 and N2 respectively,
while the opposite phenomenology was observed for ZnO:Co. These results suggest
that different defects (presumably n-type for ZnO:Co and p-type for ZnO:Mn) are
required to induce a ferromagnetic coupling in each case. We will argue that
ferromagnetism is likely to be restricted to a very thin, nanometric layer, at
the grain surface. These findings reveal and give insight into the dramatic
relevance of surface effects for the occurrence of ferromagnetism in ZnO doped
oxides.",2007-01-19T09:21:31Z
Detailed diagnostics of an X-ray flare in the single giant HR 9024,"We analyze a 96 ks Chandra/HETGS observation of the single G-type giant HR
9024. The high flux allows us to examine spectral line and continuum
diagnostics at high temporal resolution, to derive plasma parameters. A
time-dependent 1D hydrodynamic model of a loop with half-length $L = 5 \times
10^{11}$ cm ($\sim R_{\star}/2$), cross-section radius $r = 4.3 \times 10^{10}$
cm, with a heat pulse of 15 ks and $2 \times 10^{11}$~erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
deposited at the loop footpoints, satisfactorily reproduces the observed
evolution of temperature and emission measure, derived from the analysis of the
strong continuum emission. For the first time we can compare predictions from
the hydrodynamic model with single spectral features, other than with global
spectral properties. We find that the model closely matches the observed line
emission, especially for the hot ($\sim 10^8$ K) plasma emission of the FeXXV
complex at $\sim 1.85$\AA. The model loop has $L/R_{\star} \sim 1/2$ and aspect
ratio $r/L \sim 0.1$ as typically derived for flares observed in active stellar
coronae, suggesting that the underlying physics is the same for these very
dynamic and extreme phenomena in stellar coronae independently on stellar
parameters and evolutionary stage.",2007-03-15T20:26:06Z
"Superposition of Quantum and Classical Rotational Motions in Sc2C2@C84
  Fullerite","The superposition of the quantum rotational motion (tunneling) of the
encapsulated Sc2C2 complex with the classical rotational motion of the
surrounding C84 molecule in a powder crystal of Sc2C2@C84 fullerite is
investigated by theory. Since the quantum rotor is dragged along by the C84
molecule, any detection method which couples to the quantum rotor (in casu the
C2 bond of the Sc2C2 complex also probes the thermally excited classical motion
(uniaxial rotational diffusion and stochastic meroaxial jumps) of the
surrounding fullerene. The dynamic rotation-rotation response functions in
frequency space are obtained as convolutions of quantum and classical dynamic
correlation functions. The corresponding Raman scattering laws are derived, the
overall shape of the spectra and the width of the resonance lines are studied
as functions of temperature. The results of the theory are confronted with
experimental low-frequency Raman spectra on powder crystals of Sc2C2@C84 [M.
Krause et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 137403 (2004)]. The agreement of theory
with experiment is very satisfactory in a broad temperature range.",2007-02-26T13:30:46Z
"Theory of ground state cooling of a mechanical oscillator using
  dynamical back-action","A quantum theory of cooling of a mechanical oscillator by radiation
pressure-induced dynamical back-action is developed, which is analogous to
sideband cooling of trapped ions. We find that final occupancies well below
unity can be attained when the mechanical oscillation frequency is larger than
the cavity linewidth. It is shown that the final average occupancy can be
retrieved directly from the optical output spectrum.",2007-02-05T18:51:24Z
Evolutionary Quantization of Cosmological Models,"We consider a Schr\""odinger quantum dynamics for the gravitational field
associated to a FRW spacetime and then we solve the corresponding eigenvalue
problem. We show that, from a phenomenological point of view, an Evolutionary

peculiar solution can be inferred to describe the more interesting case of a
generic cosmological model.",2007-01-16T17:02:54Z
Dark Matter on small scales; Telescopes on large scales,"This article reviews recent progress in observational determination of the
properties of dark matter on small astrophysical scales, and progress towards
the European Extremely Large Telescope. Current results suggest some surprises:
the central DM density profile is typically cored, not cusped, with scale sizes
never less than a few hundred pc; the central densities are typically
10-20GeV/cc; no galaxy is found with a dark mass halo less massive than
$\sim5.10^7M_{\odot}$. We are discovering many more dSphs, which we are
analysing to test the generality of these results. The European Extremely Large
Telescope Design Study is going forward well, supported by an outstanding
scientific case, and founded on detailed industrial studies of the
technological requirements.",2007-03-14T17:45:07Z
Contrast in transmission spectroscopy of a single quantum dot,"We perform transmission spectroscopy on single quantum dots and examine the
effects of a resident carriers spin, the incident laser spot size,
polarization, and power on the experimental contrast. We demonstrate a factor
of 4 improvement in the maximum contrast by using a solid immersion lens to
decrease the spot area. This increase yields a maximum signal to noise ratio of
2000 Hz-1/2, which will allow for MHz detection frequencies. We anticipate that
this improvement will allow further investigation of spectral fluctuation and
open up the feasibility for an all-optical read-out of an electron spin in a
quantum dot.",2007-01-25T15:06:52Z
Bianchi spacetimes in noncommutative phase-space,"The effects of noncommutativity in the phase-space of the classical and

and similarities and differences are discussed.",2007-01-14T15:21:57Z
"Redesigning Decision Matrix Method with an indeterminacy-based inference
  process","For academics and practitioners concerned with computers, business and
mathematics, one central issue is supporting decision makers. In this paper, we
propose a generalization of Decision Matrix Method (DMM), using Neutrosophic
logic. It emerges as an alternative to the existing logics and it represents a
mathematical model of uncertainty and indeterminacy. This paper proposes the
Neutrosophic Decision Matrix Method as a more realistic tool for decision
making. In addition, a de-neutrosophication process is included.",2007-03-13T02:18:09Z
Coherent Matter Wave Transport in Speckle Potentials,"This article studies multiple scattering of matter waves by a disordered
optical potential in two and in three dimensions. We calculate fundamental
transport quantities such as the scattering mean free path $\ell_s$, the
Boltzmann transport mean free path $\elltrb$, and the Boltzmann diffusion
constant $D_B$, using a diagrammatic Green functions approach. Coherent
multiple scattering induces interference corrections known as weak localization
which entail a reduced diffusion constant. We derive the corresponding
expressions for matter wave transport in an correlated speckle potential and
provide the relevant parameter values for a possible experimental study of this
coherent transport regime, including the critical crossover to the regime of
strong or Anderson localization.",2007-02-07T17:17:04Z
Dynamics of metal clusters in rare gas clusters,"We investigate the dynamics of Na clusters embedded in Ar matrices. We use a
hierarchical approach, accounting microscopically for the cluster's degrees of
freedom and more coarsely for the matrix. The dynamical polarizability of the
Ar atoms and the strong Pauli-repulsion exerted by the Ar-electrons are taken
into account. We discuss the impact of the matrix on the cluster gross
properties and on its optical response. We then consider a realistic case of
irradiation by a moderately intense laser and discuss the impact of the matrix
on the hindrance of the explosion, as well as a possible pump probe scenario
for analyzing dynamical responses.",2007-01-16T13:15:39Z
"Frequency combinations in the magnetoresistance oscillations spectrum of
  a linear chain of coupled orbits with a high scattering rate","The oscillatory magnetoresistance spectrum of the organic metal
(BEDO)$_5$Ni(CN)$_4\cdot$3C$_2$H$_4$(OH)$_2$ has been studied up to 50 T, in
the temperature range from 1.5 K to 4.2 K. In high magnetic field, its Fermi
surface corresponds to a linear chain of quasi-two-dimensional orbits coupled
by magnetic breakdown (MB). The scattering rate consistently deduced from the
data relevant to the basic $\alpha$ and the MB-induced $\beta$ orbits is very
large which points to a significant reduction of the chemical potential
oscillation. Despite of this feature, the oscillations spectrum exhibits many
frequency combinations. Their effective masses and (or) Dingle temperature are
not in agreement with either the predictions of the quantum interference model
or the semiclassical model of Falicov and Stachowiak.",2007-03-09T16:47:00Z
Envelope density pattern around wide binary AGB stars: a dynamical model,"The goal is to build up a simple dynamical model for the out-flowing
circumstellar envelope around AGB stars in a wide binary system to explore the
parameter dependence of the geometrical characteristics of column density
patterns. An AGB star in a wide binary system is considered as a 3-D piston
model that can induce a 3-D quasi-spherical density structure in the
circumstellar envelope by orbital motion of the AGB star. The column density
pattern only depends on two parameters: eccentricity of the orbit e and the
terminal outflow velocity to mean orbital velocity ratio gamma. When viewed
perpendicular to the orbital plane, spiral, broken spiral, and incomplete
concentric shell patterns can be seen, while when viewed along the orbital
plane, alternative concentric half-shell, egg-shell, and half-shell half-gap
patterns will develop. Non-zero eccentricity causes asymmetry, while larger
gamma makes a weaker pattern and helps bring out asymmetry. A spiral pattern
may becomes broken when e > 0.4. The spiral center is always less than 12% of
spiral pitch away from the orbit center. One should have more chances (~ 80%)
seeing spiral-like patterns than seeing concentric shells (~ 20%) in the
circumstellar envelope of wide binary AGB stars.",2007-03-26T01:48:16Z
In Situ Treatment of a Scanning Gate Microscopy Tip,"In scanning gate microscopy, where the tip of a scanning force microscope is
used as a movable gate to study electronic transport in nanostructures, the
shape and magnitude of the tip-induced potential are important for the
resolution and interpretation of the measurements. Contaminations picked up
during topography scans may significantly alter this potential. We present an
in situ high-field treatment of the tip that improves the tip-induced
potential. A quantum dot was used to measure the tip-induced potential.",2007-03-23T08:57:34Z
Evolutionary Approaches to Minimizing Network Coding Resources,"We wish to minimize the resources used for network coding while achieving the
desired throughput in a multicast scenario. We employ evolutionary approaches,
based on a genetic algorithm, that avoid the computational complexity that
makes the problem NP-hard. Our experiments show great improvements over the
sub-optimal solutions of prior methods. Our new algorithms improve over our
previously proposed algorithm in three ways. First, whereas the previous
algorithm can be applied only to acyclic networks, our new method works also
with networks with cycles. Second, we enrich the set of components used in the
genetic algorithm, which improves the performance. Third, we develop a novel
distributed framework. Combining distributed random network coding with our
distributed optimization yields a network coding protocol where the resources
used for coding are optimized in the setup phase by running our evolutionary
algorithm at each node of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach by carrying out simulations on a number of different sets of network
topologies.",2007-02-07T05:29:25Z
Sr_2 Ru O_4 : Broken Time-Reversal Symmetry in the Superconducting state,"Using a phenomenological two-fluid model we derive the Kerr rotation of the
polarization direction of reflected light from the surface of a superconductor
in a state breaking time-reversal symmetry. We argue that this effect found
recently in the superconducting state of $Sr_2RuO_4$ by Xia et al
(Phys.Rev.Lett. {\bf 97}, 167002 (2006)) originates from the spontaneous
magnetization in this superconductor. The temperature and the frequency
dependencies of the effect are established. It is shown that the effect is
determined by one of two mechanisms depending on the frequency of light that is
larger or smaller than the plasma frequency. The mechanism originating from the
gradient of chemical potential created by the electric field of light
penetrating into the skin layer and important at frequencies larger than the
plasma frequency was missed in the preliminary version of this paper
(V.P.Mineev, arXiv:cond-mat/0703624v2).",2007-03-23T15:34:42Z
"Charge transport in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid: effects of pumping and
  bias","We study the current produced in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by an applied
bias and by weak, point-like impurity potentials which are oscillating in time.
We use bosonization to perturbatively calculate the current up to second order
in the impurity potentials. In the regime of small bias and low pumping
frequency, both the DC and AC components of the current have power law
dependences on the bias and pumping frequencies with an exponent 2K - 1 for
spinless electrons, where K is the interaction parameter. For K < 1/2, the
current becomes large for special values of the bias. For non-interacting
electrons with K = 1, our results agree with those obtained using Floquet
scattering theory for Dirac fermions. We also discuss the cases of extended
impurities and of spin-1/2 electrons.",2007-02-19T08:38:55Z
"The structural properties of the multi-layer graphene/4H-SiC(000-1)
  system as determined by Surface X-ray Diffraction","We present a structural analysis of the multi-layer graphene-4HSiC(000-1})
system using Surface X-Ray Reflectivity. We show for the first time that
graphene films grown on the C-terminated (000-1}) surface have a
graphene-substrate bond length that is very short (0.162nm). The measured
distance rules out a weak Van der Waals interaction to the substrate and
instead indicates a strong bond between the first graphene layer and the bulk
as predicted by ab-initio calculations. The measurements also indicate that
multi-layer graphene grows in a near turbostratic mode on this surface. This
result may explain the lack of a broken graphene symmetry inferred from
conduction measurements on this system [C. Berger et al., Science 312, 1191
(2006)].",2007-02-23T16:48:19Z
Mechanism of electron localization in a quantum wire,"We show that quasi-bound electron states are formed in a quantum wire as a
result of electron backscattering in the transition regions between the wire
and the electron reservoirs, to which the wire is coupled. The backscattering
mechanism is caused by electron density oscillations arising even in smooth
transitions due to the reflection of electrons not transmitting through the
wire. The quasi-bound states reveal themselves in resonances of the electron
transmission probability through the wire. The calculations were carried out
within the Hartree-Fock approximation using quasiclassic wavefunctions.",2007-03-09T13:15:02Z
"ReSHAPE: A Framework for Dynamic Resizing and Scheduling of Homogeneous
  Applications in a Parallel Environment","Applications in science and engineering often require huge computational
resources for solving problems within a reasonable time frame. Parallel
supercomputers provide the computational infrastructure for solving such
problems. A traditional application scheduler running on a parallel cluster
only supports static scheduling where the number of processors allocated to an
application remains fixed throughout the lifetime of execution of the job. Due
to the unpredictability in job arrival times and varying resource requirements,
static scheduling can result in idle system resources thereby decreasing the
overall system throughput. In this paper we present a prototype framework
called ReSHAPE, which supports dynamic resizing of parallel MPI applications
executed on distributed memory platforms. The framework includes a scheduler
that supports resizing of applications, an API to enable applications to
interact with the scheduler, and a library that makes resizing viable.
Applications executed using the ReSHAPE scheduler framework can expand to take
advantage of additional free processors or can shrink to accommodate a high
priority application, without getting suspended. In our research, we have
mainly focused on structured applications that have two-dimensional data arrays
distributed across a two-dimensional processor grid. The resize library
includes algorithms for processor selection and processor mapping. Experimental
results show that the ReSHAPE framework can improve individual job turn-around
time and overall system throughput.",2007-03-27T23:27:54Z
"Scale-freeness for networks as a degenerate ground state: A Hamiltonian
  formulation","The origin of scale-free degree distributions in the context of networks is
addressed through an analogous non-network model in which the node degree
corresponds to the number of balls in a box and the rewiring of links to balls
moving between the boxes. A statistical mechanical formulation is presented and
the corresponding Hamiltonian is derived. The energy, the entropy, as well as
the degree distribution and its fluctuations are investigated at various
temperatures. The scale-free distribution is shown to correspond to the
degenerate ground state, which has small fluctuations in the degree
distribution and yet a large entropy. We suggest an implication of our results
from the viewpoint of the stability in evolution of networks.",2007-03-09T10:12:14Z
Braneworlds and Quantum States of Relativistic Shells,"We review some applications of relativistic shells that are relevant in the
context of quantum gravity/quantum cosmology. Using a recently developed
approach, the stationary states of this general relativistic system can be
determined in the semiclassical approximation. We suggest that this technique
might be of phenomenological relevance in the context of the brane-world
scenario and we draw a picture of the general set-up and of the possible
developments.",2007-01-15T16:17:29Z
"Anomalous magnetic phase diagram in low-carrier two-band systems and
  possible application to CeOs4Sb12","Magnetic properties under the external field are investigated in low-carrier
two-band systems, which may explain the nontrivial phase boundary found in
temperature vs. magnetic field diagram discovered in some materials, such as
filled-skutterudite compound CeOs$_{4}$Sb$_{12}$. Analysis is made both for the
periodic Anderson model with the small-dispersive $f$ band and the simplified
two parabolic band model in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The magnetic
susceptibilities are calculated by using the random phase approximation. It is
shown that the maximum value of the magnetic susceptibility perpendicular to
the external field is enhanced and yields the anomalous phase boundary. By
applying the magnetic field, the phase boundary shifts to higher temperature
region in the insulating state with a small band gap. On the other hand, the
similar phase boundary also appears in the semi-metallic states, in which the
structure of the density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level and the
finite temperature effect are essential.",2007-02-26T08:47:32Z
"Detection of finite frequency current moments with a dissipative
  resonant circuit","We consider the measurement of higher current moments with a dissipative
resonant circuit, which is coupled inductively to a mesoscopic device in the
coherent regime. Information about the higher current moments is coded in the
histograms of the charge on the capacitor plates of the resonant circuit.
Dissipation is included via the Caldeira-Leggett model, and it is essential to
include it in order for the charge fluctuations (or the measured noise) to
remain finite. We identify which combination of current correlators enter the
measurement of the third moment. The latter remains stable for zero damping.
Results are illustrated briefly for a quantum point contact.",2007-02-09T17:41:27Z
Error Correction and Digitalization Concepts in Biochemical Computing,"We offer a theoretical design of new systems that show promise for digital
biochemical computing, including realizations of error correction by utilizing

Symmetry and transport property of spin current induced spin-Hall effect,"We study the spin current induced spin-Hall effect that a longitudinal spin
dependent chemical potential $qV_{s=x,y,z}$ induces a transverse spin
conductances $G^{ss'}$. A four terminal system with Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the scattering region is considered. By using
Landauer-B$\ddot u$ttiker formula with the aid of the Green function, various
spin current induced spin-Hall conductances $G^{ss'}$ are calculated. With the
charge chemical potential $qV_c$ or spin chemical potential $qV_{s=x,y,z}$,
there are 16 elements for the transverse conductances $G^{\mu
\nu}_p=J_{p,\mu}/V_{\nu}$ where $\mu,\nu=x,y,z,c$. Due to the symmetry of our
system these elements are not independent. For the system with $C_2$ symmetry
half of elements are zero, when the center region only exists the Rashba SOI or
Dresselhaus SOI. The numerical results show that of all the conductance
elements, the spin current induced spin-Hall conductances $G^{ss'}$ are usually
much greater (about one or two orders of magnitude) than the spin Hall
conductances $G^{sc}$ and the reciprocal spin Hall conductances $G^{cs}$. So
the spin current induced spin-Hall effect is dominating in the present device.",2007-02-27T13:12:14Z
Fluctuation theorem in quantum heat conduction,"We consider steady state heat conduction across a quantum harmonic chain
connected to reservoirs modelled by infinite collection of oscillators. The
heat, $Q$, flowing across the oscillator in a time interval $\tau$ is a
stochastic variable and we study the probability distribution function $P(Q)$.
In the large $\tau$ limit we use the formalism of full counting statistics
(FCS) to compute the generating function of $P(Q)$ exactly. We show that $P(Q)$
satisfies the steady state fluctuation theorem (SSFT) regardless of the
specifics of system, and it is nongaussian with clear exponential tails. The
effect of finite $\tau$ and nonlinearity is considered in the classical limit
through Langevin simulations. We also obtain predictions of universal heat
current fluctuations at low temperatures in clean wires.",2007-03-29T09:41:20Z
"Low-temperature thermodynamics for a flat-band ferromagnet: Rigorous
  versus numerical results","The repulsive Hubbard model on a sawtooth chain exhibits a lowest
single-electron band which is completely dispersionless (flat) for a specific
choice of the hopping parameters. We construct exact many-electron ground
states for electron fillings up to 1/4. We map the low-energy degrees of
freedom of the electron model to a model of classical hard dimers on a chain
and, as a result, obtain the ground-state degeneracy as well as closed-form
expressions for the low-temperature thermodynamic quantities around a
particular value of the chemical potential. We compare our analytical findings
with complementary numerical data. Although we consider a specific model, we
believe that some of our results like a low-temperature peak in the specific
heat are generic for flat-band ferromagnets.",2007-03-12T13:19:06Z
"Feedback and its Feedback Effect on Feedback: Photoionization
  Suppression and its Impact on Galactic Outflows","We show that radiative feedback due to reionization has a pronounced effect
on the extent of mechanical feedback due to galactic outflows. The
photoionization of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) suppresses low-mass galaxy
formation by photoheating the gas and limiting atomic line cooling. The number
of low-mass galaxies is central for the enrichment of the IGM as these objects
have the capacity to enrich a significant fraction (by volume) of the Universe.
We use a modified version of our galactic outflow model, combined with a simple
criterion for suppression, to investigate the potential impact upon the IGM. We
find that this suppression strongly reduces the enrichment of the IGM and is
sensitive to the reionization history. We also investigate the contribution of
halos of different masses with varying degrees of suppression.",2007-03-22T23:43:13Z
"Long range diffusion noise in platinum micro-wires with metallic
  adhesion layers","Voltage fluctuations of Platinum wires hosted by silicon nitride beams were
investigated. We considered four variants of the wires: three with an adhesion
layer and one with no adhesion layer. We found that the presence of an adhesion
layer changes the nature of the power spectrum which is $1/f$ for wires with no
adhesion layers and $1/f^{3/2}$ for wires with an adhesion layer. We attribute
the value of the exponent $\alpha=3/2$ to the long range diffusion of hydrogen
originating from adhesion layers that undergo a migration through the Pt wires.",2007-03-22T13:44:41Z
Optical properties of Ge-oxygen defect center embedded in silica films,"The photo-luminescence features of Ge-oxygen defect centers in a 100nm thick
Ge-doped silica film on a pure silica substrate were investigated by looking at
the emission spectra and time decay detected under synchrotron radiation
excitation in the 10-300 K temperature range. This center exhibits two
luminescence bands centered at 4.3eV and 3.2eV associated with its
de-excitation from singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) states, respectively, that are
linked by an intersystem crossing process. The comparison with results obtained
from a bulk Ge-doped silica sample evidences that the efficiency of the
intersystem crossing rate depends on the properties of the matrix embedding the
Ge-oxygen defect centers, being more effective in the film than in the bulk
counterpart.",2007-03-02T14:00:16Z
"Measurement of the 3-D Born-Oppenheimer Potential of a Proton in a
  Hydrogen Bonded System using Deep Inelastic Neutron Scattering: The
  Superprotonic Conductor Rb3H(SO4)2","Born-Oppenheimer (BO) potential in any material. The proton potential
surfaces in the hydrogen bonded superprotonic conductor Rb3H(SO4)2 are
extracted from the momentum distribution measured using Deep Inelastic Neutron
Scattering(DINS). The potential has a single minimum along the bond direction,
which accounts for the absence of the antiferroelectric transition seen in the
deuterated material, and a saddle point off the bond direction for tunneling
into the next well with a barrier height of 350 meV. The measured potential is
in qualitative agreement with phenomenological double Morse potentials that
have been used to describe hydrogen bonds in other systems.",2007-01-26T06:40:53Z
"A length scale for the superconducting Nernst signal above T$_{c}$ in
  Nb$_{0.15}$Si$_{0.85}$","We present a study of the Nernst effect in amorphous superconducting thin
films of Nb$_{0.15}$Si$_{0.85}$. The field dependence of the Nernst coefficient
above T$_{c}$ displays two distinct regimes separated by a field scale set by
the Ginzburg-Landau correlation length. A single function $F(\xi)$, with the
correlation length as its unique argument set either by the zero-field
correlation length (in the low magnetic field limit) or by the magnetic length
(in the opposite limit), describes the Nernst coefficient. We conclude that the
Nernst signal observed on a wide temperature ($30 \times T_c$) and field ($4
\times B_{c2}$) range is exclusively generated by short-lived Cooper pairs.",2007-01-16T13:55:04Z
Fluctuation relation for a Lévy particle,"We study the work fluctuations of a particle subjected to a deterministic
drag force plus a random forcing whose statistics is of the L\'evy type. In the
stationary regime, the probability density of the work is found to have ``fat''
power-law tails which assign a relatively high probability to large
fluctuations compared with the case where the random forcing is Gaussian. These
tails lead to a strong violation of existing fluctuation theorems, as the ratio
of the probabilities of positive and negative work fluctuations of equal
magnitude behaves in a non-monotonic way. Possible experiments that could probe
these features are proposed.",2007-03-09T17:30:04Z
"Simultaneous photon absorption as a probe of molecular interaction and
  hydrogen-bond correlation in liquids","We have investigated the simultaneous absorption of near-infrared photons by
pairs of neighboring molecules in liquid methanol. Simultaneous absorption by
two OH-stretching modes is found to occur at an energy higher than the sum of
the two absorbing modes. This frequency shift arises from interaction between
the modes, and its value has been used to determine the average coupling
between neighboring methanol molecules. We find a rms coupling strength of
46+/-1 cm-1, much larger than can be explained from transition-dipole coupling,
suggesting that hydrogen-bond mediated interactions between neighboring
molecules play an important role in liquid methanol. The most important aspect
of simultaneous vibrational absorption is that it allows for a quantitative
investigation of hydrogen-bond cooperativity. We derive the extent to which the
hydrogen-bond strengths of neighboring molecules are correlated by comparing
the line shape of the absorption band caused by simultaneous absorption with
that of the fundamental transition. Surprisingly, neighboring hydrogen bonds in
methanol are found to be strongly correlated, and from the data we obtain a
hydrogen-bond correlation coefficient of 0.69+/-0.12.",2007-03-06T15:53:03Z
"Alternative approach to all-angle negative refraction in two-dimensional
  photonic crystals","We show that with an appropriate surface modification, a slab of photonic
crystal can be made to allow wave transmission within the band gap.
Furthermore, negative refraction and all-angle-negative-refraction (AANR) can
be achieved by this surface modification in frequency windows that were not
realized before in two-dimensional photonic crystals [C. Luo et al, Phys. Rev.
B 65, 201104 (2002)]. This approach to AANR leads to new applications in flat
lens imaging. Previous flat lens using photonic crystals requires object-image
distance u+v less than or equal to the lens thickness d, u+v d. Our approach
can be used to design flat lens with u+v=sd with s>>1, thus being able to image
large and/or far away objects. Our results are confirmed by FDTD simulations.",2007-03-27T23:24:50Z
"Ion specificity and anomalous electrokinetic effects in hydrophobic
  nanochannels","We demonstrate with computer simulations that anomalous electrokinetic
effects, such as ion specificity and non-zero zeta potentials for uncharged
surfaces, are generic features of electro-osmotic flow in hydrophobic channels.
This behavior is due to the stronger attraction of larger ions to the
``vapour--liquid-like'' interface induced by a hydrophobic surface. An
analytical model involving a modified Poisson--Boltzmann description for the
ion density distributions is proposed, which allows the anomalous flow profiles
to be predicted quantitatively. This description incorporates as a crucial
component an ion-size-dependent hydrophobic solvation energy. These results
provide an effective framework for predicting specific ion effects, with
important implications for the modeling of biological problems.",2007-01-04T11:07:28Z
Dissipation effects in percolating quantum Ising magnets,"We study the effects of dissipation on a randomly dilute transverse-field
Ising magnet at and close to the percolation threshold. For weak transverse
fields, a novel percolation quantum phase transition separates a
super-paramagnetic cluster phase from an inhomogeneously ordered ferromagnetic
phase. The properties of this transition are dominated by large frozen and
slowly fluctuating percolation clusters. Implementing numerically a
strong-disorder real space renormalization group technique, we compute the
low-energy density of states which is found to be in good agreement with the
analytical prediction.",2007-03-21T18:02:55Z
"Optical spectra, crystal-field parameters, and magnetic susceptibility
  of the new multiferroic NdFe3(BO3)4","We report high-resolution optical absorption spectra for NdFe3(BO3)4 trigonal
single crystal which is known to exhibit a giant magnetoelectric effect below
the temperature of magnetic ordering TN = 33 K. The analysis of the
temperature-dependent polarized spectra reveals the energies and, in some
cases, symmetries and exchange splittings of Nd3+ 84 Kramers doublets. We
perform crystal-field calculations starting from the exchange-charge model,
obtain a set of six real crystal-field parameters, and calculate wave functions
and magnetic g-factors. In particular, the values g(perpendicular) = 2.385,
g(parallel) = 1.376 were found for the Nd3+ ground-state doublet. We obtain
Bloc=7.88 T and |JFN|= 0.48 K for the values of the local effective magnetic
field at liquid helium temperatures at the Nd3+ site and the Nd - Fe exchange
integral, respectively, using the experimentally measured Nd3+ ground-state
splitting of 8.8 cm-1. To check reliability of our set of crystal field
parameters we model the magnetic susceptibility data from literature. A dimer
containing two nearest-neighbor iron ions in the spiral chain is considered to
partly account for quasi-one-dimensional properties of iron borates, and then
the mean-field approximation is used. The results of calculations with the
exchange parameters for Fe3+ ions Jnn = -6.25 K (intra-chain interactions) and
Jnnn = -1.92 K (inter-chain interactions) obtained from fitting agree well with
the experimental data.",2007-03-21T13:29:45Z
"Low-energy properties of the ferromagnetic metallic phase in manganites:
  Slave fermion approach to the quantum double exchange model","We study the low energy properties of the one-orbital quantum double-exchange
model by using the slave fermion formulation. We construct a mean-field theory
which gives a simple explanation for the magnetic and thermodynamic properties
of the ferromagnetic metallic phase in manganites at low energy. The resulting
electron spectral function and tunneling density of states show an incoherent
asymmetric peak with weak temperature dependence, in addition to a
quasiparticle peak. We also show that the gauge fluctuations in the
ferromagnetic metallic phase are completely screened due to the Anderson-Higgs
mechanism. Therefore, the mean-field state is robust against gauge fluctuations
and exhibits spin-charge separation at low energy.",2007-02-27T03:47:43Z
Dissolution Arrest and Stability of Armored Bubbles,"Dissolving armored bubbles stabilize with nonspherical shapes by jamming the
initially Brownian particles adsorbed on their interfaces. In a gas-saturated
solution, these shapes are characterized by planar facets or folds for
decreasing ratios of the particle to bubble radii. We perform numerical
simulations that mimic dissolution, and show that the faceted shape represents
a local minimum of energy during volume reduction. This minimum is marked by
the vanishing of the Laplace overpressure $\Delta P$, which together with the
existence of a $V$-interval where $d\Delta P/dV>0$ guarantees stability against
dissolution. The reduction of $\Delta P$ is due to the saddle-shape deformation
of most of the interface which accompanies the reduction in the mean curvature
of the interface.",2007-03-25T19:28:57Z
"Rapidly rotating boson molecules with long or short range repulsion: an
  exact diagonalization study","The Hamiltonian for a small number, N <= 11, of bosons in a rapidly rotating
harmonic trap, interacting via a short range (contact potential) or a long
range (Coulomb) interaction, is studied via an exact diagonalization in the
lowest Landau level. Our analysis shows that, for both low and high fractional
fillings, the bosons localize and form rotating boson molecules (RBMs)
consisting of concentric polygonal rings. Focusing on systems with the number
of trapped atoms sufficiently large to form multi-ring bosonic molecules, we
find that, as a function of the rotational frequency and regardless of the type
of repulsive interaction, the ground-state angular momenta grow in specific
steps that coincide with the number of localized bosons on each concentric
ring. Comparison of the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) for both
interactions suggests that the degree of crystalline correlations appears to
depend more on the fractional filling nu than on the range of the interaction.
The RBMs behave as nonrigid rotors, i.e., the concentric rings rotate
independently of each other. At filling fractions nu < 1/2, we observe well
developed crystallinity in the CPDs (two-point correlation functions). For
larger filling fractions nu > 1/2, observation of similar molecular patterns
requires consideration of even higher-order correlation functions.",2007-01-15T14:58:52Z
"Swapping trajectories: a new wall-induced cross-streamline particle
  migration mechanism in a dilute suspension of spheres","Binary encounters between spherical particles in shear flow are studied for a
system bounded by a single planar wall or two parallel planar walls under
creeping flow conditions. We show that wall proximity gives rise to a new class
of binary trajectories resulting in cross-streamline migration of the
particles. The spheres on these new trajectories do not pass each other (as
they would in free space) but instead they swap their cross-streamline
positions. To determine the significance of the wall-induced particle
migration, we have evaluated the hydrodynamic self-diffusion coefficient
associated with a sequence of uncorrelated particle displacements due to binary
particle encounters. The results of our calculations quantitatively agree with
the experimental value obtained by \cite{Zarraga-Leighton:2002} for the
self-diffusivity in a dilute suspension of spheres undergoing shear flow in a
Couette device. We thus show that the wall-induced cross-streamline particle
migration is the source of the anomalously large self-diffusivity revealed by
their experiments.",2007-01-23T01:57:42Z
Anomalous Conductance Suppression in Magnetic Clusters,"Recent scanning tunneling microscope measurements on magnetic clusters reveal
an anomalous conductance dip at zero bias voltage, whenever the cluster
consists of an odd number of magnetic atoms [Science, {\bf 312}, 1021 (2006)].
We address the conductance anomaly within a model, and reproduce the
conductance dip with the only assumption that the magnetic cluster has a
conducting level near the Fermi level of the system. We show that the width of
the conductance dip scales quadratically with external magnetic fields, in
excellent agreement with experiments. In addition, we predict that the presence
of the impurity will be measurable as inelastic Friedel oscillation in the
substrate density of electron states.",2007-03-12T21:21:07Z
Efficient unidirectional nanoslit couplers for surface plasmons,"Plasmonics is based on surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes which can be
laterally confined below the diffraction limit, thereby enabling ultracompact
optical components. In order to exploit this potential, the fundamental
bottleneck of poor light-SPP coupling must be overcome. In established SPP
sources (using prism, grating} or nanodefect coupling) incident light is a
source of noise for the SPP, unless the illumination occurs away from the
region of interest, increasing the system size and weakening the SPP intensity.
Back-side illumination of subwavelength apertures in optically thick metal
films eliminates this problem but does not ensure a unique propagation
direction for the SPP. We propose a novel back-side slit-illumination method
based on drilling a periodic array of indentations at one side of the slit. We
demonstrate that the SPP running in the array direction can be suppressed, and
the one propagating in the opposite direction enhanced, providing localized
unidirectional SPP launching.",2007-03-15T12:33:42Z
"A bar in the inner halo of barred galaxies I. Structure and kinematics
  of a representative model","N-body simulations argue that the inner haloes of barred galaxies should not
be spherical, nor even axisymmetric, but triaxial. The departure from
sphericity is strongest near the centre and decreases outwards; typical axial
ratios for the innermost parts are of the order of 0.8. The halo shape is
prolate-like in the inner parts up to a certain radius and then turns to
oblate-like. I call this inner halo structure the `halo bar' and analyse here
in depth its structure and kinematics in a representative model. It is always
considerably shorter than the disc bar. It lags the disc bar by only a few
degrees at all radii and the difference between the two bar phases increases
with distance from the centre. The two bars turn with roughly the same pattern
speed. This means that the halo bar is a slow bar, since its corotation radius
is much larger than its length. The bisymmetric component in the halo continues
well outside the halo bar in the form of an open spiral, trailing behind the
disc bar. The inner parts of the halo display some mean rotation in the same
sense as the disc rotation. This is more important for particles nearer to the
equatorial plane and decreases with increasing distance from it, but is always
much smaller than the disc rotation.",2007-03-08T16:43:28Z
Transport and Percolation Theory in Weighted Networks,"We study the distribution $P(\sigma)$ of the equivalent conductance $\sigma$
for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) weighted resistor networks with
$N$ nodes. Each link has conductance $g\equiv e^{-ax}$, where $x$ is a random
number taken from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and the parameter $a$
represents the strength of the disorder. We provide an iterative fast algorithm
to obtain $P(\sigma)$ and compare it with the traditional algorithm of solving
Kirchhoff equations. We find, both analytically and numerically, that
$P(\sigma)$ for ER networks exhibits two regimes. (i) A low conductance regime
for $\sigma < e^{-ap_c}$ where $p_c=1/\av{k}$ is the critical percolation
threshold of the network and $\av{k}$ is average degree of the network. In this
regime $P(\sigma)$ is independent of $N$ and follows the power law $P(\sigma)
\sim \sigma^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha=1-\av{k}/a$. (ii) A high conductance
regime for $\sigma >e^{-ap_c}$ in which we find that $P(\sigma)$ has strong $N$
dependence and scales as $P(\sigma) \sim f(\sigma,ap_c/N^{1/3})$. For SF
networks with degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\lambda}$, $k_{min} \le k \le
k_{max}$, we find numerically also two regimes, similar to those found for ER
networks.",2007-01-22T17:17:44Z
"Single Polymer Confinement in a Slit: Correlation between structure and

excluded-volume chain under confinement, by extending the formalism of Rouse
modes. We make specific predictions about the behavior of the modes for a
single polymer confined to a slit. The results are tested against Monte Carlo
simulations using the bond-fluctuation algorithm which uses a lattice
representation of the polymer chain with excluded-volume effects.",2007-02-06T17:15:11Z
"Spectral line width decrease in the solar corona: resonant energy
  conversion from Alfv{é}n to acoustic waves","Observations reveal an increase with height of the line width of several
coronal spectral lines probably caused by outwardly propagating Alfv{\'e}n
waves. However, the spectral line width sometimes shows a sudden decrease at a
height 0.1-0.2 R, where the ratio of sound to Alfven speeds may approach unity.
Qualitative analysis shows that the resonant energy conversion from Alfven to
acoustic waves near the region of the corona where the plasma $\beta$
approaches unity may explain the observed spectral line width reduction.",2007-03-13T07:55:46Z
Correlation functions of one-dimensional anyonic fluids,"A universal description of correlation functions of one-dimensional anyonic
gapless systems in the low-momentum regime is presented. We point out a number
of interesting features, including universal oscillating terms with frequency
proportional to the statistical parameter and beating effects close to the
fermion points. The results are applied to the one-dimensional anyonic
Lieb-Liniger model and checked against the exact results in the impenetrable
limit.",2007-03-05T11:22:59Z
"Transient Zitterbewegung of charge carriers in graphene and carbon
  nanotubes","Observable effects due to trembling motion (Zitterbewegung, ZB) of charge
carriers in bilayer graphene, monolayer graphene and carbon nanotubes are
calculated. It is shown that, when the charge carriers are prepared in the form
of gaussian wave packets, the ZB has a transient character with the decay time
of femtoseconds in graphene and picoseconds in nanotubes. Analytical results
for bilayer graphene allow us to investigate phenomena which accompany the
trembling motion. In particular, it is shown that the transient character of ZB
in graphene is due to the fact that wave subpackets related to positive and
negative electron energies move in opposite directions, so their overlap
diminishes with time. This behavior is analogous to that of the wave packets
representing relativistic electrons in a vacuum.",2007-02-19T00:09:43Z
"Effects of Disorder on Charge Orderings and Superconductivity in the
  System of Coexisting Itinerant Electrons and Local Pairs","We study the phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of a system of
coexisting itinerant electrons and local pairs (LP), in the presence of
diagonal disorder. The model considered takes into account both the charge
exchange couplings, responsible for superconducting orderings, and the
density-density interactions, which can stabilize charge ordered states in the
system. Depending on the strength of the random on-site potential, the
interactions and the particle concentrations the model is found to exhibit
several various phases, including the homogeneous ones: superconducting (SC),
charge density wave (CDW) and nonordered (NO), as well as the phase separated
states (CDW-SC and CDW-NO).",2007-02-21T09:42:32Z
Exact many-electron ground states on the diamond Hubbard chain,"Exact ground states of interacting electrons on the diamond Hubbard chain in
a magnetic field are constructed which exhibit a wide range of properties such

changing the magnetic flux, local potentials, or electron density.",2007-03-30T15:24:06Z
"Symmetry breaking and clustering in a vibrated granular gas with several
  macroscopically connected compartments","The spontaneous symmetry breaking in a vibro-fluidized low-density granular
gas in three connected compartments is investigated. When the total number of
particles in the system becomes large enough, particles distribute themselves
unequally among the three compartments. Particles tend to concentrate in one of
the compartments, the other two having the (relatively small) same average
number of particles. A hydrodynamical model that accurately predicts the
bifurcation diagram of the system is presented. The theory can be easily
extended to the case of an arbitrary number of connected compartments.",2007-01-11T16:32:01Z
"The Beta Cephei instability domain for the new solar composition and
  with new OP opacities","The recent revision of the solar chemical composition (Asplund, Grevesse and
Sauval 2005)is characterized by about 40 per cent decrease of C, N, O, Ne, Ar
abundances and by 20 percent decrease of Fe and some other metal abundances. We
tested the effect of these modifications on the instability of Beta Cephei
models. For the opacities, the newest OP data from the Opacity Project (Seaton
2005) were used. We show that the Beta Cephei instability domain in the
Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, when computed with new data for Z=0.012 (revised
solar value), is very similar to the instability domain computed earlier using
the OPAL opacities for the older solar composition with Z=0.02. Almost all
observed Beta Cephei variables are located within the instability domain. Two
effects are responsible for stronger instability when using the new data: (i)
Metal opacity bump in the OP case is located slightly deeper in the star than
that in the OPAL case, which results in more effective driving; (ii) at a fixed
Z value, the new Fe-group abundances are higher than the older ones because the
Z value is determined mainly by the abundances of C, N, 0, and Ne.",2007-03-28T08:15:30Z
"Geometric Complexity Theory IV: nonstandard quantum group for the
  Kronecker problem","The Kronecker coefficient g_{\lambda \mu \nu} is the multiplicity of the
GL(V)\times GL(W)-irreducible V_\lambda \otimes W_\mu in the restriction of the
GL(X)-irreducible X_\nu via the natural map GL(V)\times GL(W) \to GL(V \otimes
W), where V, W are \mathbb{C}-vector spaces and X = V \otimes W. A fundamental
open problem in algebraic combinatorics is to find a positive combinatorial
formula for these coefficients.
  We construct two quantum objects for this problem, which we call the
nonstandard quantum group and nonstandard Hecke algebra. We show that the
nonstandard quantum group has a compact real form and its representations are
completely reducible, that the nonstandard Hecke algebra is semisimple, and
that they satisfy an analog of quantum Schur-Weyl duality.
  Using these nonstandard objects as a guide, we follow the approach of Adsul,
Sohoni, and Subrahmanyam to construct, in the case dim(V) = dim(W) =2, a
representation \check{X}_\nu of the nonstandard quantum group that specializes
to Res_{GL(V) \times GL(W)} X_\nu at q=1. We then define a global crystal basis
+HNSTC(\nu) of \check{X}_\nu that solves the two-row Kronecker problem: the
number of highest weight elements of +HNSTC(\nu) of weight (\lambda,\mu) is the
Kronecker coefficient g_{\lambda \mu \nu}. We go on to develop the beginnings
of a graphical calculus for this basis, along the lines of the U_q(\sl_2)
graphical calculus, and use this to organize the crystal components of
+HNSTC(\nu) into eight families. This yields a fairly simple, explicit and
positive formula for two-row Kronecker coefficients, generalizing a formula of
Brown, van Willigenburg, and Zabrocki. As a byproduct of the approach, we also
obtain a rule for the decomposition of Res_{GL_2 \times GL_2 \rtimes \S_2}
X_\nu into irreducibles.",2007-03-22T15:35:29Z
"Full counting statistics of chaotic cavities from classical action
  correlations","We present a trajectory-based semiclassical calculation of the full counting
statistics of quantum transport through chaotic cavities, in the regime of many
open channels. Our method to obtain the $m$th moment of the density of
transmission eigenvalues requires two correlated sets of $m$ classical
trajectories, therefore generalizing previous works on conductance and shot
noise. The semiclassical results agree, for all values of $m$, with the
corresponding predictions from random matrix theory.",2007-03-30T09:03:32Z
The structure of the Galactic halo: SDSS versus SuperCOSMOS,"The halo structure at high Galactic latitudes near both the north and south
poles is studied using SDSS and SuperCOSMOS data. For the south cap halo, the
archive of the SuperCOSMOS photographic photometry sky survey is used. The
coincident source rate between SuperCOSMOS data in $B_J$ band from $16^m.5$ to
$20^m.5$ and SDSS data is about 92%, in a common sky area in the south. While
that in the $R_F$ band is about 85% from $16^m.5$ to $19^m.5$. Transformed to
the SuperCOSMOS system and downgraded to the limiting magnitudes of
SuperCOSMOS, the star counts in the northern Galactic cap from SDSS show up to
an $16.9\pm6.3%$ asymmetric ratio (defined as relative fluctuations over the
rotational symmetry structure) in the $B_J$ band, and up to $13.5\pm6.7%$
asymmetric ratio in the $R_F$ band. From SuperCOSMOS $B_J$ and $R_F$ bands, the
structure of the southern Galactic hemisphere does not show the same obvious
asymmetric structures as the northern sky does in both the original and
downgraded SDSS star counts. An axisymmetric halo model with n=2.8 and q=0.7
can fit the projected number density from SuperCOSMOS fairly well, with an
average error of about 9.17%. By careful analysis of the difference of star
counts between the downgraded SDSS northern halo data and SuperCOSMOS southern
halo data, it is shown that no asymmetry can be detected in the south Galactic
cap at the accuracy of SuperCOSMOS, and the Virgo overdensity is likely a
foreign component in the Galactic halo.",2007-03-20T06:30:33Z

the symmetrized Ricci tensor, is dynamically equivalent to the metric
Einstein-Maxwell Lagrangian, except the zero-field limit, for which the metric
tensor is not well-defined. This feature indicates that, for the
Ferraris-Kijowski model to be physical, there must exist a background field
that depends on the Ricci tensor. The simplest possibility, supported by recent
astronomical observations, is the cosmological constant, generated in the
purely affine formulation of gravity by the Eddington Lagrangian. In this paper
we combine the electromagnetic field and the cosmological constant in the
purely affine formulation. We show that the sum of the two affine (Eddington
and Ferraris-Kijowski) Lagrangians is dynamically inequivalent to the sum of
the analogous ($\Lambda$CDM and Einstein-Maxwell) Lagrangians in the
metric-affine/metric formulation. We also show that such a construction is
valid, like the affine Einstein-Born-Infeld formulation, only for weak
electromagnetic fields, on the order of the magnetic field in outer space of
the Solar System. Therefore the purely affine formulation that combines
gravity, electromagnetism and cosmological constant cannot be a simple sum of
affine terms corresponding separately to these fields. A quite complicated form
of the affine equivalent of the metric Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ Lagrangian
suggests that Nature can be described by a simpler affine Lagrangian, leading
to modifications of the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$CDM theory for
electromagnetic fields that contribute to the spacetime curvature on the same
order as the cosmological constant.",2007-01-31T20:10:06Z
Functional Keldysh Theory of Spin Torques,"We present a microscopic treatment of current-induced torques and thermal
fluctuations in itinerant ferromagnets based on a functional formulation of the
Keldysh formalism. We find that the nonequilibrium magnetization dynamics is
governed by a stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation with spin transfer
torques. We calculate the Gilbert damping parameter $\alpha$ and the
non-adiabatic spin transfer torque parameter $\beta$ for a model ferromagnet.
We find that $\beta \neq \alpha$, in agreement with the results obtained using
imaginary-time methods of Kohno, Tatara and Shibata [J. Phys. Soc. Japan 75,
113706 (2006)]. We comment on the relationship between $s-d$ and
isotropic-Stoner toy models of ferromagnetism and more realistic
density-functional-theory models, and on the implications of these
relationships for predictions of the $\beta/\alpha$ ratio which plays a central
role in domain wall motion. Only for a single-parabolic-band isotropic-Stoner
model with an exchange splitting that is small compared to the Fermi energy
does $\beta/\alpha$ approach one. In addition, our microscopic formalism
incorporates naturally the fluctuations needed in a nonzero-temperature
description of the magnetization. We find that to first order in the applied
electric field, the usual form of thermal fluctuations via a phenomenological
stochastic magnetic field holds.",2007-03-15T15:58:32Z
"In situ growth regime characterization of cubic GaN using reflection
  high energy electron diffraction","Cubic GaN layers were grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on
3C-SiC (001)substrates. In situ reflection high energy electron diffraction was
used to quantitatively determine the Ga coverage of the GaN surface during
growth. Using the intensity of the electron beam as a probe,optimum growth
conditions of c-GaN were found when a 1 ML Ga coverage is formed at the
surface. 1 micrometer thick c-GaN layers had a minimum surface roughness of 2.5
nm when a Ga coverage of 1 ML was established during growth. These samples
revealed also a minimum full width at half maximum of the (002)rocking curve.",2007-02-01T14:49:40Z
Infrared spectroscopy of carbon monoxide in V838 Mon during 2002--2006,"We report spectra of the overtone and fundamental bands of CO in the eruptive
variable V838 Mon, which trace the recent evolution of the star and allow its
ejecta to be characterized. The data were obtained at the United Kingdom
Infrared Telescope on fourteen nights from 2002 January, shortly after the
first outburst of the star, to 2006 April. Although the near-infrared stellar
spectrum superficially resembled a cool supergiant after both the first and
third of its outbursts in 2002, its infrared ""photosphere"" at that time
consisted of highly blueshifted gas that was moving outward from the original
stellar surface. A spectrum obtained during the third outburst reveals a
remarkable combination of emission and absorption in the CO first overtone
bands. The most recent observations show a composite spectrum that includes a
stellar-like photosphere at a temperature similar to that seen just after the
initial outburst, but at a radial velocity redshifted by 15 km/s relative to
the stellar velocity determined from SiO maser emission, suggesting that the
atmosphere is now contracting. Three shell components, corresponding to
expansion velocities of 15, 85, and 145 km/s, also are present, but absorption
is seen at all expansion velocities out to 200km/s. Weak absorption features of
fundamental band lines of 13CO have been detected. However, the large
uncertainty in the value of [12C/13C] does not constrain the evolutionary
status of the progenitor.",2007-03-14T22:33:22Z
Phonons in honeycomb and auxetic two-dimensional lattices,"The modes of vibrations in honeycomb and auxetic structures are studied, with
models in which the lattice is represented by a planar network where sites are
connected by strings and rigid rods. The auxetic network is obtained modifying
a model proposed by Evans et al. in 1991, and used to explain the negative
Poisson's ratio of auxetic materials. This relevant property means that the
materials have a lateral extension, instead to shrink, when they are stretched.
For what concerns the acoustic properties of these structures, they absorb
noise and vibrations more efficiently than non-auxetic equivalents. The
acoustic and optical dispersions obtained in the case of the auxetic model are
compared with the dispersions displayed by a conventional honeycomb network. It
is possible to see that the phonon dispersions of the auxetic model possess a
complete bandgap and that the Goldstone mode group velocity is strongly
dependent on the direction of propagation. The presence of a complete bandgap
can explain some experimental observations on the sound propagation properties
of the auxetic materials.",2007-03-09T21:48:43Z
The Quest to Understand the Pioneer Anomaly,"The Pioneer 10/11 missions, launched in 1972 and 1973, and their navigation
are reviewed. Beginning in about 1980 an unmodeled force of ~ 8 x 10^{-8}
cm/s^2 appeared in the tracking data, it later being verified. The cause
remains unknown, although radiant heat remains a likely origin. A set of
efforts to find the solution are underway: a) analyzing in detail all available
data, b) using data from the New Horizons mission, and c) considering an ESA
dedicated mission.",2007-02-02T23:05:42Z
More Accurate Theory for Bose-Einstein Condensation Fraction,"In the thermodynamic limit the ratio of system size to thermal de Broglie
wavelength tends to infinity and the volume per particle of the system is
constant. Our familiar Bose-Einstein statistics is absolutely valid in the
thermodynamic limit. For finite thermodynamical system this ratio as well as
the number of particles is much greater than 1. However, according to the
experimental setup of Bose-Einstein condensation of harmonically trapped Bose
gas of alkali atoms this ratio near the condensation temperature($T_c$)
typically is $\sim 32$ and at ultralow temperatures well below $T_c$ a large
fraction of particles come down to the single particle ground state, and this
ratio becomes comparable to 1. We justify the finite size as well as ultralow
temperature correction to Bose-Einstein statistics. From this corrected
statistics we plot condensation fraction versus temperature graph. This
theoretical plot satisfies well with the experimental plot(A. Griesmaier et
al..,Phys.Rev.Lett. {\bf{{94}}}{(2005){160401}}).",2007-01-18T15:06:26Z
"Topology and Dynamics of Attractor Neural Networks: The Role of
  Loopiness","We derive an exact representation of the topological effect on the dynamics
of sequence processing neural networks within signal-to-noise analysis. A new
network structure parameter, loopiness coefficient, is introduced to
quantitatively study the loop effect on network dynamics. The large loopiness
coefficient means the large probability of finding loops in the networks. We
develop the recursive equations for the overlap parameters of neural networks
in the term of the loopiness. It was found that the large loopiness increases
the correlations among the network states at different times, and eventually it
reduces the performance of neural networks. The theory is applied to several
network topological structures, including fully-connected, densely-connected
random, densely-connected regular, and densely-connected small-world, where
encouraging results are obtained.",2007-03-15T10:42:09Z
Complete Wetting of Pits and Grooves,"For one-component volatile fluids governed by dispersion forces an effective
interface Hamiltonian, derived from a microscopic density functional theory, is
used to study complete wetting of geometrically structured substrates. Also the
long range of substrate potentials is explicitly taken into account. Four types
of geometrical patterns are considered: (i) one-dimensional periodic arrays of
rectangular or parabolic grooves and (ii) two-dimensional lattices of
cylindrical or parabolic pits. We present numerical evidence that at the
centers of the cavity regions the thicknesses of the adsorbed films obey
precisely the same geometrical covariance relation, which has been recently
reported for complete cone and wedge filling. However, this covariance does not
hold for the laterally averaged wetting film thicknesses. For sufficiently deep
cavities with vertical walls and close to liquid-gas phase coexistence in the
bulk, the film thicknesses exhibit an effective planar scaling regime, which as
function of undersaturation is characterized by a power law with the common
critical exponent -1/3 as for a flat substrate, but with the amplitude
depending on the geometrical features.",2007-01-26T17:03:25Z
Appearance of ferroelectricity in thin films of incipient ferroelectric,"The consideration of size-induced ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition
for conventional and incipient ferroelectrics thin films with perovskite
structure was carried out in phenomenological theory framework of
Ginsburg-Landau-Devonshire. The more general form of surface free energy
expansion that includes intrinsic surface stress tensor, surface piezoelectric
effect and electrostriction as well as quadratic and quartic powers of surface
polarization has been considered. The analytical expressions for thickness
dependence of transition temperature was derived both for the conventional and
incipient ferroelectrics. It was shown that although there is no
ferroelectricity in the bulk incipient ferroelectrics it appears in thin film
for the negative extrapolation length that is realized e.g. at positive surface
stress coefficient and negative or zero misfit strain. In our consideration we
came to the conclusion about thickness induced ferroelectricity in incipient
ferroelectrics KTaO3 at room temperature for the thin enough films. The similar
surface effects can influence strongly on the phase transitions in the thin
films of another incipient ferroelectrics, SrTiO3.",2007-03-27T18:52:34Z
Nonmagnetic-Defect-Induced Magnetism in Graphene,"It is shown that a strong impurity potential induces short-range
antiferromagnetic (ferrimagnetic) order around itself in a Hubbard model on a
half-filled honeycomb lattice. This implies that short-range magnetic order is
induced in monolayer graphene by a nonmagnetic defect such as a vacancy with
full hydrogen termination or a chemisorption defect.",2007-03-22T07:10:03Z
Flexible Audio Streams,"Tremendous research effort was invested in audio browsers and machine
learning techniques to decode the structure of Web pages in order to put them
into an audio format. In this paper, we address a simpler and efficient
solution for the creation of an audio browser of VOICEXML generated from
RSS/Atom stream feeds. We developed a multimodal (audio and graphical) portal
application that offers RSS/Atom feeds. By utilizing sing our system, the user
can interact using voice or graphic commands, listen and watch digital content,
such as news, blogs feeds, podcasts, and even access email and personal
schedules. The portal system permits the use of security credentials
(user/password authentication) to collect secure RSS/Atom stream in the

experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the RSS reader

applications, from interfaces for the visual impaired users to browsers for
mobile telephonic interfaces.",2007-03-15T00:00:06Z
Singlet ground state in the spin-1/2 dimer compound Sr3Cr2O8,"Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat versus temperature measurements on
polycrystalline samples of Sr3Cr2O8 and the isostructural, nonmagnetic compound
Sr3V2O8 are reported. A Curie-Wiess fit to the high-temperature susceptibility
data for Sr3Cr2O8 indicates that the Cr atoms are in the rare Cr^5+ (Spin S =
1/2) valence state as expected from the composition. The ground state was found
to be a spin singlet with an excitation gap Delta/k_ B = 61.9(1) K to the
magnetic triplet states, and a weak interdimer coupling of 6(2) K was inferred.
The specific heat and susceptibility measurements on Sr3V2O8 reveal a phase
transition at 110 K which is evidently a structural transition.",2007-02-13T17:42:35Z
Single quantum dot nanowire LEDs,"We report reproducible fabrication of InP-InAsP nanowire light emitting
diodes in which electron-hole recombination is restricted to a
quantum-dot-sized InAsP section. The nanowire geometry naturally self-aligns
the quantum dot with the n-InP and p-InP ends of the wire, making these devices
promising candidates for electrically-driven quantum optics experiments. We
have investigated the operation of these nano-LEDs with a consistent series of
experiments at room temperature and at 10 K, demonstrating the potential of
this system for single photon applications.",2007-01-06T01:48:16Z
Non-Minimally Coupled Cosmology as Geodesic Motion,"Recent works showing that homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies involving
scalar fields correspond to geodesics of certain augmented spaces are

some of the dynamical properties of the cosmologies from the geometry of the
associated augmented spaces.",2007-02-07T00:23:07Z
Statistical properties of single-file diffusion front,"Statistical properties of the front of a semi-infinite system of single-file
diffusion (one dimensional system where particles cannot pass each other, but
in-between collisions each one independently follow diffusive motion) are
investigated. Exact as well as asymptotic results are provided for the
probability density function of (a) the front-position, (b) the maximum of the
front-positions, and (c) the first-passage time to a given position. The
asymptotic laws for the front-position and the maximum front-position are found
to be governed by the Fisher-Tippett-Gumbel extreme value statistics. The
asymptotic properties of the first-passage time is dominated by a
stretched-exponential tail in the distribution. The farness of the front with
the rest of the system is investigated by considering (i) the gap from the
front to the closest particle, and (ii) the density profile with respect to the
front-position, and analytical results are provided for late time behaviors.",2007-03-09T14:39:06Z
"First-Principles calculation of atomic hydrogen adsorption on
  Be(10\={1}0) thin films","We present a first-principles study of the atomic hydrogen adsorption onto
the Be(10\={1}0) thin film. There are two types of Be(10\={1}0) surfaces
according to the interlayer spacing between the surface and its
nearest-neighbor layer. We show that the H adsorption features on these two
kinds of surfaces are remarkably different. The work function, averaged
electrostatic potential, and the local charge density consistently show that
the charge is transferred from H to Be for L-type (see the text below)
surfaces, while the transfer process is inverted for S-type surfaces.",2007-03-13T10:00:36Z
A reduced model for shock and detonation waves. II. The reactive case,"We present a mesoscopic model for reactive shock waves, which extends a
previous model proposed in [G. Stoltz, Europhys. Lett. 76 (2006), 849]. A
complex molecule (or a group of molecules) is replaced by a single
mesoparticle, evolving according to some Dissipative Particle Dynamics.
Chemical reactions can be handled in a mean way by considering an additional
variable per particle describing a rate of reaction. The evolution of this rate
is governed by the kinetics of a reversible exothermic reaction. Numerical
results give profiles in qualitative agreement with all-atom studies.",2007-01-20T16:10:40Z
"Fermi-liquid approach for description of initial stage of fragmentation
  at heavy nuclei collisions","A mechanism is proposed for initial stage of instability development that can
induce the fragmentation of nuclear matter, arising as a result of collisions
of non-relativistic heavy nuclei. Collision of heavy nuclei is simulated as a
collision of two unbounded Fermi-liquid ``drops''. The instability origination
in such a system is related to propagation of increasing oscillations in the
nuclear matter. These oscillations can exist in a resting Fermi-liquid:
modified Landau zero sound, modified spin and isospin waves, combination of
these more simple waves. These instabilities are analogous to the beam
instability in ordinary electron plasma. Behavior features of the obtained
oscillation increase increments are provided. They can be used as indication
for experimental confirmation of the proposed mechanism of fragmentation at
nuclear collisions. Directions along which nuclear matter ``jets'' can be
expected are specified.",2007-03-17T16:58:58Z
"Effective Field Theory of Triangular-Lattice Three-Spin Interaction
  Model","We discuss an effective field theory of a triangular-lattice three-spin
interaction model defined by the ${\mathbb Z}_p$ variables. Based on the
symmetry properties and the ideal-state graph concept, we show that the vector
dual sine-Gordon model describes the long-distance properties for $p\ge5$; we
then compare its predictions with the previous argument. To provide the
evidences, we numerically analyze the eigenvalue structure of the transfer
matrix for $p=6$, and we check the criticality with the central charge $c=2$ of
the intermediate phase and the quantization condition of the vector charges.",2007-03-15T06:14:22Z
"Topological defects in the crystalline state of one-component plasmas of
  non-uniform density","We study the ground state properties of classical Coulomb charges interacting
with a 1/r potential moving on a plane but confined either by a circular hard
wall boundary or by a harmonic potential. The charge density in the continuum
limit is determined analytically and is non-uniform. Because of the non-uniform
density there are both disclinations and dislocations present and their
distribution across the system is calculated and shown to be in agreement with
numerical studies of the ground state (or at least low-energy states) of N
charges, where values of N up to 5000 have been studied. A consequence of these
defects is that although the charges locally form into a triangular lattice
structure, the lattice lines acquire a marked curvature. A study is made of
conformal crystals to illuminate the origin of this curvature. The scaling of
various terms which contribute to the overall energy of the system of charges
viz, the continuum electrostatic energy, correlation energy, surface energy
(and so on) as a function of the number of particles N is determined. ""Magic
number"" clusters are those at special values of N whose energies take them
below the energy estimated from the scaling forms and are identified with
charge arrangements of high symmetry.",2007-02-27T18:57:31Z
"Quantum Phase Transition in Lattice Model of Unconventional
  Superconductors","In this paper we shall introduce a lattice model of unconventional
superconductors (SC) like d-wave SC in order to study quantum phase transition
at vanishing temperature ($T$). Finite-$T$ counterpart of the present model was
proposed previously with which SC phase transition at finite $T$ was
investigated. The present model is a noncompact U(1) lattice-gauge-Higgs model
in which the Higgs boson, the Cooper-pair field, is put on lattice links in
order to describe d-wave SC. We first derive the model from a microscopic
Hamiltonian in the path-integral formalism and then study its phase structure
by means of the Monte Carlo simulations. We calculate the specific heat,
monopole densities and the magnetic penetration depth (the gauge-boson mass).
We verified that the model exhibits a second-order phase transition from normal
to SC phases. Behavior of the magnetic penetration depth is compared with that
obtained in the previous analytical calculation using XY model in four
dimensions. Besides the normal to SC phase transition, we also found that
another second-order phase transition takes place within the SC phase in the
present model. We discuss physical meaning of that phase transition.",2007-03-29T07:52:23Z
"Relay Assisted F/TDMA Ad Hoc Networks: Node Classification, Power
  Allocation and Relaying Strategies","This paper considers the design of relay assisted F/TDMA ad hoc networks with
multiple relay nodes each of which assists the transmission of a predefined
subset of source nodes to their respective destinations. Considering the sum
capacity as the performance metric, we solve the problem of optimally
allocating the total power of each relay node between the transmissions it is
assisting. We consider four different relay transmission strategies, namely
regenerative decode-and-forward (RDF), nonregenerative decode-and-forward
(NDF), amplify-and-forward (AF) and compress-and-forward (CF). We first obtain
the optimum power allocation policies for the relay nodes that employ a uniform
relaying strategy for all nodes. We show that the optimum power allocation for
the RDF and NDF cases are modified water-filling solutions. We observe that for
a given relay transmit power, NDF always outperforms RDF whereas CF always
provides higher sum capacity than AF. When CF and NDF are compared, it is
observed that either of CF or NDF may outperform the other in different
scenarios. This observation suggests that the sum capacity can be further
improved by having each relay adopt its relaying strategy in helping different
source nodes. We investigate this problem next and determine the optimum power
allocation and relaying strategy for each source node that relay nodes assist.
We observe that optimum power allocation for relay nodes with hybrid relaying
strategies provides higher sum capacity than pure RDF, NDF, AF or CF relaying
strategies.",2007-01-02T12:14:26Z
2H-NMR studies of supercooled and glassy aspirin,"Acetyl salicylic acid, deuterated at the methyl group, was investigated using
2H-NMR in its supercooled and glassy states. Just above the glass transition
temperature the molecular reorientations were studied using stimulated-echo
spectroscopy and demonstrated a large degree of similarity with other glass
formers. Deep in the glassy phase the NMR spectra look similar to those
reported for the crystal [A. Detken, P. Focke, H. Zimmermann, U. Haeberlen, Z.
Olejniczak, Z. T. Lalowicz, Z. Naturforsch. A 50 (1995) 95] and below 20 K they
are indicative for rotational tunneling with a relatively large tunneling
frequency. Measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation times for temperatures
below 150 K reveal a broad distribution of correlation times in the glass. The
dominant energy barrier characterizing the slow-down of the methyl group is
significantly smaller than the well defined barrier in the crystal.",2007-01-10T13:06:05Z
"Non-thermal desorption from interstellar dust grains via exothermic
  surface reactions","Aims: The gas-phase abundance of methanol in dark quiescent cores in the
interstellar medium cannot be explained by gas-phase chemistry. In fact, the
only possible synthesis of this species appears to be production on the
surfaces of dust grains followed by desorption into the gas. Yet, evaporation
is inefficient for heavy molecules such as methanol at the typical temperature
of 10 K. It is necessary then to consider non-thermal mechanisms for
desorption. But, if such mechanisms are considered for the production of
methanol, they must be considered for all surface species. Methods: Our
gas-grain network of reactions has been altered by the inclusion of a
non-thermal desorption mechanism in which the exothermicity of surface addition
reactions is utilized to break the bond between the product species and the
surface. Our estimated rate for this process derives from a simple version of
classical unimolecular rate theory with a variable parameter only loosely
contrained by theoretical work. Results: Our results show that the chemistry of
dark clouds is altered slightly at times up to 10^6 yr, mainly by the
enhancement in the gas-phase abundances of hydrogen-rich species such as
methanol that are formed on grain surfaces. At later times, however, there is a
rather strong change. Instead of the continuing accretion of most gas-phase
species onto dust particles, a steady-state is reached for both gas-phase and
grain-surface species, with significant abundances for the former.
Nevertheless, most of the carbon is contained in an undetermined assortment of
heavy surface hydrocarbons. Conclusions: The desorption mechanism discussed
here will be better constrained by observational data on pre-stellar cores,
where a significant accretion of species such as CO has already occurred.",2007-03-08T19:17:50Z

Regularity at space-like and null infinity,"We extend Penrose's peeling model for the asymptotic behaviour of solutions
to the scalar wave equation at null infinity on asymptotically flat
backgrounds, which is well understood for flat space-time, to Schwarzschild and
the asymptotically simple space-times of Corvino-Schoen/Chrusciel-Delay. We
combine conformal techniques and vector field methods: a naive adaptation of
the ``Morawetz vector field'' to a conformal rescaling of the Schwarzschild
metric yields a complete scattering theory on Corvino-Schoen/Chrusciel-Delay
space-times. A good classification of solutions that peel arises from the use
of a null vector field that is transverse to null infinity to raise the
regularity in the estimates. We obtain a new characterization of solutions
admitting a peeling at a given order that is valid for both Schwarzschild and
Minkowski space-times. On flat space-time, this allows large classes of
solutions than the characterizations used since Penrose's work. Our results
establish the validity of the peeling model at all orders for the scalar wave
equation on the Schwarzschild metric and on the corresponding
Corvino-Schoen/Chrusciel-Delay space-times.",2007-01-08T20:54:10Z
Phase coherent transport in a side-gated mesoscopic graphite wire,"We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a thin graphite wire
resting on a silicon oxide substrate. The electric field effect is demonstrated
with back and side gate electrodes. We study the conductance fluctuations as a
function of gate voltage, magnetic field and temperature. The phase coherence
length extracted from weak localization is larger than the wire width even at
the lowest carrier densities making the system effectively one-dimensional. We
find that the phase coherence length increases linearly with the conductivity
suggesting that at 1.7 K dephasing originates mainly from electron-electron
interactions.",2007-02-18T14:26:33Z
Effective mass anomalies in strained Si thin films and crystals,"Effective mass anomalies due to the geometrical effects are investigated in
silicon nanostructures using first-principles calculations for the first time.
In \{111\} and \{110\} biaxially strained Si, it is found that longitudinal
effective mass is extraordinarily enhanced for both thin films and crystals.
This mass enhancement is caused by the change of the band structure with double
minima into that with a single minimum due to strain and confinement. At the
transition point, it is analytically shown that the effective mass diverges.
The dependences of the confinement thickness on the anomalies are qualitatively
explained by an extension of the effective mass approximation.",2007-01-16T12:09:10Z
"On the macroion virial contribution to the osmotic pressure in
  charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions","Our interest goes to the different virial contributions to the equation of
state of charged colloidal suspensions. Neglect of surface effects in the
computation of the colloidal virial term leads to spurious and paradoxical
results. This pitfall is one of the several facets of the danger of a naive
implementation of the so called One Component Model, where the micro-ionic
degrees of freedom are integrated out to only keep in the description the
mesoscopic (colloidal) degrees of freedom. On the other hand, due incorporation
of wall induced forces dissolves the paradox brought forth in the naive
approach, provides a consistent description, and confirms that for salt-free
systems, the colloidal contribution to the pressure is dominated by the
micro-ionic one. Much emphasis is put on the no salt case but the situation
with added electrolyte is also discussed.",2007-01-31T11:11:38Z
Bubbles and Quantum Tunnelling in Inflationary Cosmology,"We review a procedure to use semiclassical methods in the quantization of

Hofstadter butterfly for a finite correlated system,"We investigate a finite two-dimensional system in the presence of external
magnetic field. We discuss how the energy spectrum depends on the system size,
boundary conditions and Coulomb repulsion. On one hand, using these results we
present the field dependence of the transport properties of a nanosystem. In
particular, we demonstrate that these properties depend on whether the system
consists of even or odd number of sites. On the other hand, on the basis of
exact results obtained for a finite system we investigate whether the
Hofstadter butterfly is robust against strong electronic correlations. We show
that for sufficiently strong Coulomb repulsion the Hubbard gap decreases when
the magnetic field increases.",2007-03-22T00:27:15Z
Option Valuation using Fourier Space Time Stepping,"It is well known that the Black-Scholes-Merton model suffers from several
deficiencies. Jump-diffusion and Levy models have been widely used to partially
alleviate some of the biases inherent in this classical model. Unfortunately,
the resulting pricing problem requires solving a more difficult partial-integro
differential equation (PIDE) and although several approaches for solving the
PIDE have been suggested in the literature, none are entirely satisfactory. All
treat the integral and diffusive terms asymmetrically and are difficult to
extend to higher dimensions. We present a new, efficient algorithm, based on
transform methods, which symmetrically treats the diffusive and integrals
terms, is applicable to a wide class of path-dependent options (such as
Bermudan, barrier, and shout options) and options on multiple assets, and
naturally extends to regime-switching Levy models. We present a concise study
of the precision and convergence properties of our algorithm for several
classes of options and Levy models and demonstrate that the algorithm is
second-order in space and first-order in time for path-dependent options.",2007-03-14T19:48:42Z
Real-Time Model-Checking: Parameters everywhere,"In this paper, we study the model-checking and parameter synthesis problems
of the logic TCTL over discrete-timed automata where parameters are allowed
both in the model (timed automaton) and in the property (temporal formula). Our
results are as follows. On the negative side, we show that the model-checking
problem of TCTL extended with parameters is undecidable over discrete-timed
automata with only one parametric clock. The undecidability result needs
equality in the logic. On the positive side, we show that the model-checking
and the parameter synthesis problems become decidable for a fragment of the
logic where equality is not allowed. Our method is based on automata theoretic
principles and an extension of our method to express durations of runs in timed
automata using Presburger arithmetic.",2007-01-22T15:20:20Z
"Fabrication and Low Temperature Thermoelectric Properties of Na_xCoO_2
  (x = 0.68 and 0.75) Epitaxial Films by the Reactive Solid-Phase Epitaxy","We have fabricated Na_xCoO_2 thin films via lateral diffusion of sodium into
Co_3O_4 (111) epitaxial films (reactive solid-phase epitaxy: Ref. 4). The
environment of thermal diffusion is key to the control of the sodium content in
thin films. From the results of x-ray diffraction and in-plane resistivity, the
epitaxial growth and the sodium contents of these films were identified. The
thermoelectric measurements show a large thermoelectric power similar to that
observed in single crystals. The quasiparticle scattering rate is found to
approach zero at low temperatures, consistent with the small residual
resistivity, indicating high quality of the Na_xCoO_2 thin films.",2007-01-20T04:11:54Z
Spheroidal geometry approach to fullerene molecules,"Graphite is an example of a layered material that can be bent to form
fullerenes which promise important applications in electronic nanodevices. The
spheroidal geometry of a slightly elliptically deformed sphere was used as a
possible approach to fullerenes. We assumed that for a small deformation the
eccentricity of the spheroid is smaller than one. We are interested here in the
big elliptically deformed fullerenes.The low-lying electronic levels are
described by the Dirac equation in (2+1) dimensions. We show how a small
deformation of spherical geometry evokes a shift of the electronic spectra
compared to the sphere. The flux of a monopole field was included inside the
surface to describe the fullerenes. Both the electronic spectrum of spherical
and the shift of spheroidal fullerenes were derived.",2007-03-23T13:14:15Z
"Simulation of Phase Combinations in Shape Memory Alloys Patches by
  Hybrid Optimization Methods","In this paper, phase combinations among martensitic variants in shape memory
alloys patches and bars are simulated by a hybrid optimization methodology. The
mathematical model is based on the Landau theory of phase transformations. Each
stable phase is associated with a local minimum of the free energy function,
and the phase combinations are simulated by minimizing the bulk energy. At low
temperature, the free energy function has double potential wells leading to
non-convexity of the optimization problem. The methodology proposed in the
present paper is based on an initial estimate of the global solution by a
genetic algorithm, followed by a refined quasi-Newton procedure to locally
refine the optimum. By combining the local and global search algorithms, the
phase combinations are successfully simulated. Numerical experiments are
presented for the phase combinations in a SMA patch under several typical
mechanical loadings.",2007-02-28T14:09:42Z
"Superlattice Magnetophonon Resonances in Strongly Coupled InAs/GaSb
  Superlattices","We report an experimental study of miniband magnetoconduction in
semiconducting InAs/GaSb superlattices. For samples with miniband widths below
the longitudinal optical phonon energy we identify a new superlattice
magnetophonon resonance (SLMPR) caused by resonant scattering of electrons
across the mini-Brillouin zone. This new resonant feature arises directly from
the drift velocity characteristics of the superlattice dispersion and total
magnetic quantisation of the superlattice Landau level minibands.",2007-01-10T17:10:02Z

"Control of optical emission in doped GaAs/AlGaAs nanofabricated quantum
  dots","Dilute arrays of GaAs/AlGaAs modulation-doped quantum dots (QDs) fabricated
by electron-beam lithography and low impact reactive-ion etching exhibit highly
homogeneous luminescence. Single quantum dots display spectral emission with
peak energies and linewidths linked largely to the geometrical diameter of the
dot and to the built-in electron population. Excitonic-like and
biexcitonic-like emission intensities have activation energy of about 2 meV.
These results highlight the potential of high quality nanofabricated QDs for
applications in areas that require fine control of optical emission.",2007-03-02T13:14:43Z
Stoichiometry of Electrostatic Complexes Determined by Light Scattering,"We report on the electrostatic complexation between oppositely charged
polymers and inorganic nanoparticles investigated by static and dynamical light
scattering. The nanoparticles put under scrutiny were citrate-coated
nanocrystals of cerium oxide (CeO2, nanoceria), of iron oxide (Fe2O3,
maghemite) and of europium-doped yttrium vanadate (Eu:YVO4) with sizes in the
10 nm range. For the polymers, we have used cationic-neutral diblock copolymers
(poly(trimethylammonium ethylacrylate)-b-poly(acrylamide), hereafter referred
to as PTEA-b-PAM) with different molecular weights. For the three colloidal
dispersions, we show that the electrostatic complexation gives rise to the
formation of stable nanoparticle clusters in the 100 nm range. The complexation
was monitored by systematic measurements of the scattering intensity versus X,
the mixing ratio between nanoparticles and polymers. For 5 nanoparticle/polymer
pairs, namely CeO2/PTEA5K-b-PAM30K, Fe2O3/PTEA5K-b-PAM30K,
Fe2O3/PTEA11K-b-PAM30K, Eu:YVO4/PTEA2K-b-PAM60K and Eu:YVO4/PTEA5K-b-PAM30K, we
found a unique behavior : the scattering intensity exhibits a sharp and
prominent peak in the intermediate X-range. To account for this behavior, we
have developed a model which assumes that regardless of X, the mixed aggregates
are formed at a fixed polymer-to-nanoparticle ratio. The agreement between the
results and the model is excellent on the 5 systems. Results at different
molecular weights suggest that the stoichiometry of the mixed aggregates is
controlled by the electrostatic interactions between the opposite charges. The
model allows to derive the molecular weight and the stoichiometry of the mixed
aggregates.",2007-01-26T16:46:03Z
"Discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the low-frequency
  peaked BL Lacertae object BL Lacertae","The MAGIC collaboration observed BL Lacertae for 22.2 hr during 2005 August
to December and for 26 hr during 2006 July to September. The source is the
historical prototype and eponym of a class of low-frequency peaked BL Lacertae
(LBL) objects. A very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray signal was discovered with a
5.1 sigma excess in the 2005 data. Above 200 GeV, an integral flux of 0.6+-0.2
x 10^(-11) cm^(-2) s^(-1) was measured, corresponding to approximately 3% of
the Crab flux. The differential spectrum between 150 and 900 GeV is rather
steep with a photon index of -3.6+-0.5. The light curve shows no significant
variability during the observations in 2005. For the first time a clear
detection of VHE gamma-ray emission from an LBL object was obtained with a
signal below previous upper limits. The 2006 data show no significant excess.
This drop in flux follows the observed trend in optical activity.",2007-03-05T20:50:55Z
Gas-solid coexistence of adhesive spheres,"In this note we investigate using basic free energy considerations the

discussed.",2007-03-14T16:03:10Z
"Reply to the Comment on the paper ""Non-mean-field behavior of the
  contact process on scale-free networks""","The Comment by Ha et al. [cond-mat/0603787] criticizes our recent result
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 038701 (2006)] that the contact process (CP) on
uncorrelated scale-free (SF) networks does not behave according to
heterogeneous mean-field (MF) theory. This claim is based in Gaussian ansatz
that reproduces previously reported density fluctuations and numerical
simulations for a particular value of the degree exponent $\gamma$ that seem to
fit the MF prediction for the density decay exponent $\theta$ and a conjecture
of the authors of the comment for the finite-size scaling exponente
$\alpha=\beta/ \nu_\perp$. By means of extensive simulations of the CP on
random neighbors (RN) SF networks we show that the MF prediction for $\theta4
is incorrect for small degree exponents, while the author's conjecture for
$\alpha$ is at best only approximately valid for the unphysical case of
uncorrelated networks with cut-off $k_c \sim N^{1/(\gamma-1)}$, which can only
be constructed in the RN version of SF networks. Therefore, the main conclusion
of our paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 038701 (2006)], the invalidity of MF theory
for real uncorrelated SF networks, remains unchallenged.",2007-01-12T13:23:59Z
Long-term pulse profile study of the Be/X-ray pulsar SAX J2103.5+4545,"Aims. We present the first long-term pulse profile study of the X-ray pulsar
SAX J2103.5+4545. Our main goal is to study the pulse shape correlation either
with luminosity, time or energy.
  Methods. This Be/X-ray binary system was observed from 1999 to 2004 by RXTE
PCA, and by INTEGRAL from 2002 to 2005, during the Performance and Verification
(PV) phase and the Galactic Plane Scan survey (GPS). X-ray pulse profiles were
obtained in different energy ranges. The long-term spectral variability of this
source is studied. The long-term flux, frequency and spin-up rate histories are
computed. A new set of orbital parameters are also determined.
  Results. The pulse shape is complex and highly variable either with time or
luminosity. However, an energy dependence pattern was found. Single, double,
triple or even quadruple peaks pulse profile structure was obtained. It was
confirmed that SAX J2103.5+4545 becomes harder when the flux is higher. The new
orbital solution obtained is: P_orb= 12.66528+-0.00051 days, e = 0.401+-0.018,
w = 241.36+-2.18 and a_xsin i = 80.81+-0.67 lt-s.",2007-03-03T13:10:16Z
"Improved tests on the relationship between the kinetic energy of
  galaxies and the mass of their central black holes","We support, with new fitting instruments and the analysis of more recent
experimental data, the proposal of a relationship between the mass of a
Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) and the kinetic energy of random motions in the
host elliptical galaxy. The first results obtained in a previous paper with 13
elliptical galaxies are now confirmed by the new data and an enlarged sample.
We find $M_{BH} \propto (M_{G} \sigma^{2}/c^2)^\beta$ with $0.8 \leq \beta \leq
1$ depending on the different fitting methods and samples used. The meaningful
case $\beta = 1$ is carefully analyzed. Furthermore, we test the robustness of
our relationship including in the sample also lenticular and spiral galaxies
and we show that the result does not change. Finally we find a stronger
correlation between the mass of the galaxy and the corresponding velocity
dispersion that allows to connect our relationship to the $M_{BH} \propto
\sigma^\alpha$ law. With respect to this law, our relationship has the
advantage to have a smaller scatter.",2007-03-27T09:21:47Z
Kauffman networks with threshold functions,"We investigate Threshold Random Boolean Networks with $K = 2$ inputs per
node, which are equivalent to Kauffman networks, with only part of the
canalyzing functions as update functions. According to the simplest
consideration these networks should be critical but it turns out that they show
a rich variety of behaviors, including periodic and chaotic oscillations. The
results are supported by analytical calculations and computer simulations.",2007-01-09T15:08:58Z
Rabi oscillations from ultrasound in spin systems,"It is shown that ultrasound in the GHz range can generate space-time Rabi

"Photoluminescence and spectral switching of single CdSe/ZnS colloidal
  nanocrystals in poly(methyl methacrylate)","Emission from single CdSe nanocrystals in PMMA was investigated. A fraction
of the nanocrystals exhibiting switching between two energy states, which have
similar total intensities, but distinctly different spectra were observed. We
found that the spectral shift characteristic frequency increases with the pump
power. By using the dynamic shift in the spectral position of emission peaks,
we were able to correlate peaks from the same nanocrystal. The measured
correlation is consistent with assignment of low energy lines to phonon
replicas.",2007-03-30T08:08:25Z
Negative Spin Valve effects in manganite/organic based devices,"We report detailed investigations of hybrid organic-inorganic vertical spin
valves. Spin polarized injection in tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3)
organic semiconductor (OS) was performed using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 manganite as the
bottom electrode and Co as the top electrode. While manganite was directly
connected to the organic semiconductor layer, a thin tunnel barrier was placed
between the OS and the Co electrode. A clear negative spin valve effect - low
resistance for antiparallel electrodes configuration - was observed below 210 K
in various devices using two different tunnel barriers: LiF and Al2O3. The
magnetoresistance effect was found to be strongly asymmetric with respect to
the bias voltage. Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES) investigation of the
interface between manganite and Alq3 revealed a strong interface dipole, which
leads to a better matching of the metal Fermi level with Alq3 LUMO (1.1 eV)
rather than with HOMO level (1.7 eV). This unequivocally indicates that the
current in these devices is dominated by the electron channel, and not by holes
as previously suggested. The knowledge of the energy diagram at the bottom
interface allowed us to work out a semi- quantitative model explaining both
negative spin valve effect and strong voltage asymmetry. This model involves a
sharp energy selection of the moving charges by the very narrow LUMO level of
the organic material leading to peculiar resonant effects.",2007-01-24T20:39:06Z
Electronic and atomic shell structure in aluminum nanowires,"We report experiments on aluminum nanowires in ultra-high vacuum at room
temperature that reveal a periodic spectrum of exceptionally stable structures.
Two ""magic"" series of stable structures are observed: At low conductance, the
formation of stable nanowires is governed by electronic shell effects whereas
for larger contacts atomic packing dominates. The crossover between the two
regimes is found to be smooth. A detailed comparison of the experimental
results to a theoretical stability analysis indicates that while the main
features of the observed electron-shell structure are similar to those of
alkali and noble metals, a sequence of extremely stable wires plays a unique
role in Aluminum. This series appears isolated in conductance histograms and
can be attributed to ""superdeformed"" non-axisymmetric nanowires.",2007-03-22T18:32:22Z
Crystalline Surface Phases of the Liquid Au-Si Eutectic Alloy,"A two dimensional crystalline layer is found at the surface of the liquid
eutectic Au$_{82}$Si$_{18}$ alloy above its melting point $T_M=359 ^{\circ}$C.
Underlying this crystalline layer we find a layered structure, 6-7 atomic
layers thick. This surface layer undergoes a first-order solid-solid phase
transition occurring at $371 ^{\circ}$C. The crystalline phase observed for
T$>$371 $^{\circ}$C is stable up to at least 430 $^{\circ}$C. Grazing Incidence
X-ray Diffraction data at T$>$371 $^{\circ}$C imply lateral order comprising
two coexisting phases of different oblique unit cells, in stark contrast with
the single phase with a rectangular unit cell found for low-temperature
crystalline phase $359 ^{\circ}$C$<T<371 ^{\circ}$C.",2007-02-17T20:39:38Z
On the densest MIMO lattices from cyclic division algebras,"It is shown why the discriminant of a maximal order within a cyclic division
algebra must be minimized in order to get the densest possible matrix lattices
with a prescribed nonvanishing minimum determinant. Using results from class
field theory a lower bound to the minimum discriminant of a maximal order with
a given center and index (= the number of Tx/Rx antennas) is derived. Also
numerous examples of division algebras achieving our bound are given. E.g. we
construct a matrix lattice with QAM coefficients that has 2.5 times as many
codewords as the celebrated Golden code of the same minimum determinant. We
describe a general algorithm due to Ivanyos and Ronyai for finding maximal
orders within a cyclic division algebra and discuss our enhancements to this
algorithm. We also consider general methods for finding cyclic division
algebras of a prescribed index achieving our lower bound.",2007-03-12T09:39:47Z
Self-interaction in Green's-function theory of the hydrogen atom,"Atomic hydrogen provides a unique test case for computational electronic
structure methods, since its electronic excitation energies are known
analytically. With only one electron, hydrogen contains no electronic
correlation and is therefore particularly susceptible to spurious
self-interaction errors introduced by certain computational methods. In this
paper we focus on many-body perturbation-theory (MBPT) in Hedin's GW
approximation. While the Hartree-Fock and the exact MBPT self-energy are free
of self-interaction, the correlation part of the GW self-energy does not have
this property. Here we use atomic hydrogen as a benchmark system for GW and
show that the self-interaction part of the GW self-energy, while non-zero, is
small. The effect of calculating the GW self-energy from exact wavefunctions
and eigenvalues, as distinct from those from the local-density approximation,
is also illuminating.",2007-01-24T12:10:45Z
Mechanism of nucleation and growth near the gas-liquid spinodal,"Understanding the mechanism of nucleation of the stable phase inside the
metastable parent phase during a first order phase transition has been a
subject of outstanding interest in natural science. The problem becomes even
more challenging as the spinodal is approached. In this work, we have
undertaken extensive computer simulation studies to probe the molecular
mechanism for the onset of instability. We have constructed the free energy
surfaces of nucleation as a function of multiple reaction coordinates, both for
supercooled Lennard-Jones fluid and for 2- and 3-dimensional Ising models.
While the classical Becker-Doring (BD) picture of homogenous nucleation, that
assumes the growth of a single nucleus by single particle addition, holds good
at low to moderate supersaturation, the formation of the new stable phase
becomes more collective and spread over the whole system at large
supersaturation. As the spinodal curve is approached from the coexistence line,
the free energy, as a function of the size of the largest liquid-like cluster,
develops a minimum at a sub-critical cluster size. This minimum at intermediate
size is responsible for the barrier towards further growth of the nucleus at
large supersaturation. As the spinodal is approached closely, this minimum
gradually disappears and so does the free energy barrier for the cluster
growth. We find the emergence of an alternative free energy pathway (with a
barrier less than that in the BD picture) that involves participation of many
sub-critical liquid-like clusters and the growth of the stable phase is
promoted by a coalescence mechanism. Very close to the spinodal the free energy
surface becomes quite flat, the significance of a critical nucleus is lost and
the classical Becker-Doring picture of nucleation breaks down.",2007-02-06T21:06:28Z
"Dispersive microwave bifurcation of a superconducting resonator cavity
  incorporating a Josephson junction","We have observed the dynamical bistability of a microwave superconducting
Fabry-Perot cavity incorporating a non-linear element in the form of Josephson
tunnel junction. The effect, which is the analog of optical bistability,
manifests itself in the transmission and reflection characteristics of the
cavity and is governed by a competition between the wave amplitude dependence
of the resonant frequency and the finite residence time of the field energy
inside the cavity. This finite residence time is solely due to extraction of
radiation from the cavity by the measurement process. The tight quantitative
agreement with a simple model based on the Duffing oscillator equation shows
that the nonlinearity, and hence the bifurcation phenomenon, is solely
dispersive.",2007-02-19T20:30:50Z
On the 3 dimensional structure of edge-on disk galaxies,"A simple algorithm is employed to deproject the two dimensional images of a
pilot sample of 12 high-quality images of edge-on disk galaxies and to study
their intrinsic 3 dimensional stellar distribution. We examine the radial
profiles of the stars as a function of height above the plane and report a
general trend within our sample of an increasing radial scalelength with height
outside of the dustlane. This could be explained by the widespread presence of
a thick disk component in these galaxies. In addition, the 3 dimensional view
allows the study of the vertical distribution of the outer disk, beyond the
break region, where we detect a significant increase in scalelength with
vertical distance from the major axis for the truncated disks. This could be
regarded as a weakening of the ""truncation"" with increasing distance from the
plane. Furthermore, we conclude that the recently revised classification of the
radial surface brightness profiles found for face-on galaxies is indeed
independent of geometry. In particular, we find at least one example of each of
the three main profile classes as defined in complete samples of intermediate
to face-on galaxies: not-truncated, truncated and antitruncated. The position
and surface brightness that mark the break location in the radial light
distribution are found to be consistent with those of face-on galaxies.",2007-03-29T17:34:43Z
"Electrodynamics of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconducting
  state","We develop the Ginzburg-Landau theory of the vortex lattice in clean
isotropic three-dimensional superconductors at large Maki parameter, when
inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state is favored. We show that
diamagnetic superfluid currents mainly come from paramagnetic interaction of
electron spins with local magnetic field, and not from kinetic energy response
to the external field as usual. We find that the stable vortex lattice keeps
its triangular structure as in usual Abrikosov mixed state, while the internal
magnetic field acquires components perpendicular to applied magnetic field.
Experimental possibilities related to this prediction are discussed.",2007-03-05T15:20:10Z
Entanglement creation in circuit QED via Landau-Zener sweeps,"A qubit may undergo Landau-Zener transitions due to its coupling to one or
several quantum harmonic oscillators. We show that for a qubit coupled to one
oscillator, Landau-Zener transitions can be used for single-photon generation
and for the controllable creation of qubit-oscillator entanglement, with
state-of-the-art circuit QED as a promising realization. Moreover, for a qubit
coupled to two cavities, we show that Landau-Zener sweeps of the qubit are well
suited for the robust creation of entangled cavity states, in particular
symmetric Bell states, with the qubit acting as the entanglement mediator. At
the heart of our proposals lies the calculation of the exact Landau-Zener
transition probability for the qubit, by summing all orders of the
corresponding series in time-dependent perturbation theory. This transition
probability emerges to be independent of the oscillator frequencies, both
inside and outside the regime where a rotating-wave approximation is valid.",2007-03-15T19:32:05Z
Magnetic circular dichroism in EELS: Towards 10 nm resolution,"We describe a new experimental setup for the detection of magnetic circular
dichroism with fast electrons (EMCD). As compared to earlier findings the
signal is an order of magnitude higher, while the probed area could be
significantly reduced, allowing a spatial resolution of the order of 30 nm. A
simplified analysis of the experimental results is based on the decomposition
of the Mixed Dynamic Form Factor S(q,q',E) into a real part related to the
scalar product and an imaginary part related to the vector product of the
scattering vectors q and q'. Following the recent detection of chiral
electronic transitions in the electron microscope the present experiment is a
crucial demonstration of the potential of EMCD for nanoscale investigations.",2007-03-01T12:58:36Z
Phase transitions induced by confinement of ferroic nanoparticles,"General approach for consideration of primary ferroic (ferroelectric,
ferromagnetic, ferroelastic) nanoparticles phase transitions was proposed in
phenomenological theory framework. The surface stress, order parameter
gradient, striction as well as depolarization and demagnetization effects were
included into the free energy. The strong intrinsic surface stress under the
curved nanoparticle surface was shown to play the important role in the shift
of transition temperature (if any) up to the appearance of new ordered phase
absent in the bulk ferroic. The approximate analytical expression for the
size-induced ferroelectric transition temperature dependence on cylindrical or
spherical nanoparticle sizes, polarization gradient coefficient, correlation
radius, intrinsic surface stress and electrostriction coefficient was derived.
It was shown that the transition temperature of nanoparticle could be higher
than the one of the bulk material. The best conditions of ferroelectric
properties conservation and enhancement in nanowires correspond to the radius
5-50nm and compressive surface stress. Under the favorable conditions size
effects (spatial confinement) induces ferroelectric phase in incipient
ferroelectrics nanowires and nanospheres. The prediction of size-induced
ferroelectricity in KTaO3 nanorods with radius less then 5-20 nm at room
temperatures could be important for the next step of device miniaturization
based on 3D nanostructures.",2007-03-25T19:07:02Z
Discrete random walk models for space-time fractional diffusion,"A physical-mathematical approach to anomalous diffusion may be based on
generalized diffusion equations (containing derivatives of fractional order in
space or/and time) and related random walk models. The fundamental solution
(for the {Cauchy} problem) of the fractional diffusion equations can be
interpreted as a probability density evolving in time of a peculiar
self-similar stochastic process that we view as a generalized diffusion
process. By adopting appropriate finite-difference schemes of solution, we
generate models of random walk discrete in space and time suitable for
simulating random variables whose spatial probability density evolves in time
according to a given fractional diffusion equation.",2007-02-04T10:15:30Z
Ultraslow optical waveguiding in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate,"We investigate waveguiding of ultraslow light pulses in an atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that under the conditions of off-resonant
electromagnetically induced transparency, waveguiding with a few ultraslow

condensate can be controlled by means of experimentally accessible parameters.
Propagation constants and the mode conditions are determined analytically using
a WKB analysis. Mode profiles are found numerically.",2007-01-15T08:41:20Z
"On the spin asymmetry of ground states in trapped two-component Fermi
  gases with repulsive interactions","We examine the spin asymmetry of ground states for two-dimensional,
harmonically trapped two-component gases of fermionic atoms at zero temperature
with weakly repulsive short range interactions. Our main result is that, in
contrast to the three-dimensional case, in two dimensions a non-trivial
spin-asymmetric phase can only be caused by shell structure. A simple,
qualitative description is given in terms of an approximate single particle
model, comparing well to the standard results of Hartree-Fock or direct
diagonalization methods.",2007-02-26T14:47:00Z
Nanoinsulators and nanoconnectors for optical nanocircuits,"Following our recent idea of using plasmonic and non-plasmonic nanoparticles
as nanoinductors and nanocapacitors in the infrared and optical domains [N.
Engheta, A. Salandrino, and A. Alu, Phys. Rev. Letts., Vol. 95, 095504,
(2005)], in this work we analyze in detail some complex circuit configurations
involving series and parallel combinations of these lumped nanocircuit elements
at optical frequencies. Using numerical simulations, it is demonstrated that,
after a proper design, the behavior of these nanoelements may closely mimic
that of their lower frequency (i.e., radio frequency (RF) and microwave)
counterparts, even in relatively complex configurations. In addition, we
analyze here in detail the concepts of nanoinsulators and nanoconnectors in the
optical domain, demonstrating how these components may be crucial in minimizing
the coupling between adjacent optical nanocircuit elements and in properly
connecting different branches of the nanocircuit. The unit nanomodules for
lumped nanoelements are introduced as building blocks for more complex
nanocircuits at optical frequencies. Numerical simulations of some complex
circuit scenarios considering the frequency response of these nanocircuits are
presented and discussed in details, showing how practical applications of such
optical nanocircuit concepts may indeed be feasible within the current limits
of nanotechnology.",2007-03-23T13:19:31Z
"Spin Configurations and Activation Gaps of the Quantum Hall States in
  Graphene","We report on our accurate evaluation of spin polarizations of the ground
state and particle-hole gaps for partially-filled lowest Landau level, observed
in recent experiments on graphene subjected to ultra-high magnetic fields. We
find that inter-electron interactions are important at these filling factors,
characterized by the non-degenerate ground states and large particle-hole gaps
at infinitely large wave vectors. The gaps are the largest for the quantum Hall
states in the second Landau level. The weak appearance of quantum Hall plateaus
in the experiments for certain filling factors in the second Landau level
however indicates that at these filling factors, the system has a soft mode at
a finite wave vector due presumably to the presence of disorder.",2007-03-21T04:33:18Z
On the roughness of single- and bi-layer graphene membranes,"We present a detailed transmission electron microscopy and electron
diffraction study of the thinnest possible membrane, a single layer of carbon

of two graphene layers are also reported. We find that the membranes exhibit an
apparently random spontaneous curvature that is strongest in single-layer
membranes. A direct visualization of the roughness is presented for two-layer
membranes where we used the variation of diffracted intensities with the local
orientation of the membrane.",2007-03-01T19:09:40Z
Efficient Searching and Retrieval of Documents in PROSA,"Retrieving resources in a distributed environment is more difficult than
finding data in centralised databases. In the last decade P2P system arise as
new and effective distributed architectures for resource sharing, but searching
in such environments could be difficult and time-consuming. In this paper we
discuss efficiency of resource discovery in PROSA, a self-organising P2P system
heavily inspired by social networks. All routing choices in PROSA are made
locally, looking only at the relevance of the next peer to each query. We show
that PROSA is able to effectively answer queries for rare documents, forwarding
them through the most convenient path to nodes that much probably share
matching resources. This result is heavily related to the small-world structure
that naturally emerges in PROSA.",2007-02-22T10:22:39Z
"How to discriminate easily between Directed-percolation and Manna
  scaling","Here we compare critical properties of systems in the directed-percolation

occurring in the presence of a non-diffusive conserved field, i.e. transitions
in the so-called Manna or C-DP class. Even if it is clearly established that
these constitute two different universality classes, most of their universal
features (exponents, moment ratios, scaling functions,...) are very similar,
making it difficult to discriminate numerically between them. Nevertheless, as
illustrated here, the two classes behave in a rather different way upon
introducing a physical boundary or wall. Taking advantage of this, we propose a
simple and fast method to discriminate between these two universality classes.
This is particularly helpful in solving some existing discrepancies in
self-organized critical systems as sandpiles.",2007-03-08T12:06:49Z
"A three-dimensional model for artificial atoms and molecules: Influence
  of substrate orientation and magnetic field dependence","A full three-dimensional model for the calculation of the electronic
structure of semiconductor quantum dots (QD) and molecules (QDM) grown on high
index surfaces and/or in the presence of an external magnetic field is
presented. The strain distribution of the dots is calculated using continuum
elasticity and singe-particle states are extracted from the nonsymmetrized
eight-band k.p theory. The model properly takes into account the effects of
different substrate orientation by rotation of the coordinate system in the way
that one coordinate coincides with the growth direction, whereas the effects of
a tilted external magnetic field are taken into account throught the Zeeman
effect and employing a gauge invariant scheme based on Wilson's formulation of
lattice gauge theory. We point out the role of piezoelectricity for InAs/GaAs
QDs grown on [11k], where k = 1,2,3,4,5,7,9 and for QDMs containing eight
InAs/GaAs QDs grown on [11l], where l = 1,2,3. We predict the variation of the
transition energies of the QDM as a function of substrate orientation and
interdot distances in the molecule. We address the magnetic field direction
dependent variation of the electronic properties of QD and QDM.",2007-03-27T19:36:04Z
"The Laser Astrometric Test of Relativity: Science, Technology, and
  Mission Design","The Laser Astrometric Test of Relativity (LATOR) experiment is designed to
explore general theory of relativity in the close proximity to the Sun -- the
most intense gravitational environment in the solar system. Using independent
time-series of highly accurate measurements of the Shapiro time-delay
(interplanetary laser ranging accurate to 3 mm at 2 AU) and interferometric
astrometry (accurate to 0.01 picoradian), LATOR will measure gravitational
deflection of light by the solar gravity with accuracy of 1 part in a billion
-- a factor ~30,000 better than currently available. LATOR will perform series
of highly-accurate tests in its search for cosmological remnants of scalar
field in the solar system. We present science, technology and mission design
for the LATOR mission.",2007-01-18T07:52:43Z
"Behavior of bulk high-temperature superconductors of finite thickness
  subjected to crossed magnetic fields","Crossed magnetic field effects on bulk high-temperature superconductors have
been studied both experimentally and numerically. The sample geometry
investigated involves finite-size effects along both (crossed) magnetic field
directions. The experiments were carried out on bulk melt-processed Y-Ba-Cu-O
(YBCO) single domains that had been pre-magnetized with the applied field
parallel to their shortest direction (i.e. the c-axis) and then subjected to
several cycles of the application of a transverse magnetic field parallel to
the sample ab plane. The magnetic properties were measured using orthogonal
pick-up coils, a Hall probe placed against the sample surface and
Magneto-Optical Imaging (MOI). We show that all principal features of the
experimental data can be reproduced qualitatively using a two-dimensional
finite-element numerical model based on an E-J power law and in which the
current density flows perpendicularly to the plane within which the two
components of magnetic field are varied. The results of this study suggest that
the suppression of the magnetic moment under the action of a transverse field
can be predicted successfully by ignoring the existence of flux-free
configurations or flux-cutting effects. These investigations show that the
observed decay in magnetization results from the intricate modification of
current distribution within the sample cross-section. It is also shown that the
model does not predict any saturation of the magnetic induction, even after a
large number (~ 100) of transverse field cycles. These features are shown to be
consistent with the experimental data.",2007-03-13T09:45:14Z
"On the occurrence of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless behavior in highly
  anisotropic cuprate superconductors","The conflicting observations in the highly anisotropic Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x,
vidence for BKT behavior emerging from magnetization data and smeared 3D-xy
behavior, stemming form the temperature dependence of the magnetic in-plane
penetration depth are traced back to the rather small ratio, gsic+/gsic-=0.45,
between the c-axis correlation length probed above (+) and below (-) Tc, and
the comparatively large anisotropy. The latter leads to critical amplitudes
gsic0+,-which are substantially smaller than the distance between two CuO2
double layers. In combination with gsic+/gsic-=0.45 and in contrast to the
situation below Tc the c-axis correlation length gsic exceeds the distance
between two CuO2 double layers very close to Tc only. Below this narrow
temperature regime where 3D-xy fluctuations dominate, there is then an extended
temperature regime where the units with two CuO2 double layers are nearly
uncoupled so that 2D thermal fluctuations dominate and BKT features are
observable.",2007-02-15T07:13:46Z
Loschmidt echoes in two-body random matrix ensembles,"Fidelity decay is studied for quantum many-body systems with a dominant
independent particle Hamiltonian resulting e.g. from a mean field theory with a
weak two-body interaction. The diagonal terms of the interaction are included
in the unperturbed Hamiltonian, while the off-diagonal terms constitute the
perturbation that distorts the echo. We give the linear response solution for
this problem in a random matrix framework. While the ensemble average shows no
surprising behavior, we find that the typical ensemble member as represented by
the median displays a very slow fidelity decay known as ``freeze''. Numerical
calculations confirm this result and show, that the ground state even on
average displays the freeze. This may contribute to explanation of the
``unreasonable'' success of mean field theories.",2007-02-05T17:42:36Z
Magnetic effects at the interface between nonmagnetic oxides,"The electronic reconstruction at the interface between two insulating oxides
can give rise to a highly-conductive interface. In analogy to this remarkable
interface-induced conductivity we show how, additionally, magnetism can be
induced at the interface between the otherwise nonmagnetic insulating
perovskites SrTiO3 and LaAlO3. A large negative magnetoresistance of the
interface is found, together with a logarithmic temperature dependence of the
sheet resistance. At low temperatures, the sheet resistance reveals magnetic
hysteresis. Magnetic ordering is a key issue in solid-state science and its
underlying mechanisms are still the subject of intense research. In particular,
the interplay between localized magnetic moments and the spin of itinerant
conduction electrons in a solid gives rise to intriguing many-body effects such
as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions, the Kondo effect, and
carrier-induced ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors. The
conducting oxide interface now provides a versatile system to induce and
manipulate magnetic moments in otherwise nonmagnetic materials.",2007-03-01T16:24:58Z
"Deviation from Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background
  temperature fluctuations","Recent measurements of the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation from the WMAP satellite provide indication of a
non-Gaussian behavior. Although the observed feature is small, it is detectable
and analyzable. Indeed, the temperature distribution P^{CMB}(Delta T) of these
data can be quite well fitted by the anomalous probability distribution
emerging within nonextensive statistical mechanics, based on the entropy S_q =
k (1 - \int dx [P(x)]^q)/(q - 1) (where in the limit case q -> 1 we obtain the
Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy S_1 = - k \int dx P(x) ln[P(x)]). For the CMB
frequencies analysed, \nu= 40.7, 60.8, and 93.5 GHz, P^{CMB}(Delta T) is well
described by P_q(Delta T) \propto 1/[1 + (q-1) B(\nu) (Delta T)^2]^{1/(q-1)},
with q = 1.04 \pm 0.01, the strongest non-Gaussian contribution coming from the
South-East sector of the celestial sphere. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations
exclude, at the 99% confidence level, P_1(Delta T) \propto e^{- B(\nu) (Delta
T)^2} to fit the three-year WMAP data.",2007-03-28T03:39:02Z

al. studied the irreversibility and fluctuation theorem for stationary time
series. In this comment, we point out that the fluctuation theorem is in fact
the trivial outcome of a symmetry operation, and hence its physical contect is
less convincing.",2007-03-08T15:30:49Z
Electronic parameters for the hole transfer in DNA duplex oligomers,"We report on our calculations of the inner-sphere reorganization energy and
the interaction of the pi orbitals within DNA oligomers. The exponential
decrease of the electronic coupling between the highest and second highest
occupied base orbitals of the intrastrand nucleobases in the (A-T)n and (G-C)n
oligomers have been found with an increase of the sequence number n in the DNA
structure. We conclude that for realistic estimation of the electronic coupling
values between the nucleobases within the DNA molecule, a DNA chain containing
at least four base pairs is required. We estimate the geometry relaxation of
the base pairs within the (A-T)n and (G-C)n oligomers (n=1-6) due to their
oxidation. The decrease of the inner-sphere reorganization energy with
elongation of the oligomer structure participating in the oxidation process
have been observed. The maximum degree of geometry relaxation of the nucleobase
structures and correspondingly the higher charge density in the oxidized state
are found to be located close to the oligomer center.",2007-03-28T17:51:43Z
Density functional calculations of nanoscale conductance,"Density functional calculations for the electronic conductance of single
molecules are now common. We examine the methodology from a rigorous point of
view, discussing where it can be expected to work, and where it should fail.
When molecules are weakly coupled to leads, local and gradient-corrected
approximations fail, as the Kohn-Sham levels are misaligned. In the weak bias
regime, XC corrections to the current are missed by the standard methodology.
For finite bias, a new methodology for performing calculations can be
rigorously derived using an extension of time-dependent current density
functional theory from the Schroedinger equation to a Master equation.",2007-03-22T20:18:33Z
Wave Propagation in the Cantor-Set Media: Chaos from Fractal,"Propagation of waves in the Cantor-set media is investigated by a
renormalization-group type method. We find fixed points for complete
reflection, $T^*=0$, and for complete transmission, $T^*=1$. In addition, the
wave numbers for which transmission coefficients show chaotic behaviors are
reported. The results obtained are for optical waves, and they can be tested in
optical experiments. Our method could be applied to any wave propagation
through the Cantor set.",2007-02-19T16:12:22Z
Gellation of rigid filament networks,"We consider a model for gelation of rigid rods, in which rods that are
initially placed at random undergo diffusion, and form cross-links when they
collide. In the limit of point-like cross-links, the number N of croslinks per
rod approaches N ~ 3.53. In a model with compliant cross-links of maximum
length l_c, N(t) increases with time as N(t) ~ const. + cL^2 l_c ln(t), where c
is concentration and L is rod length.",2007-03-15T17:10:50Z
Dissolution Arrest and Stability of Armored Bubbles,"Dissolving armored bubbles stabilize with nonspherical shapes by jamming the
initially Brownian particles adsorbed on their interfaces. In a gas-saturated
solution, these shapes are characterized by planar facets or folds for
decreasing ratios of the particle to bubble radii. We perform numerical
simulations that mimic dissolution, and show that the faceted shape represents
a local minimum of energy during volume reduction. This minimum is marked by
the vanishing of the Laplace overpressure $\Delta P$, which together with the
existence of a $V$-interval where $d\Delta P/dV>0$ guarantees stability against
dissolution. The reduction of $\Delta P$ is due to the saddle-shape deformation
of most of the interface which accompanies the reduction in the mean curvature
of the interface.",2007-03-25T19:28:57Z
"Study of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth in the cuprate
  superconductor Ca_2-xNa_xCuO_2Cl_2: role of the apical sites","A study of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_ab in a series of
the cuprate superconductors Ca_2-xNa_xCuO_2Cl_2 (Na-CCOC) with Na content
x=0.11, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, and 0.19 is reported. The zero temperature values of
\lambda_ab(0) were obtained by means of the muon-spin rotation technique, as
well as from measurements of the intrinsic susceptibility \chi^int(0) by using
the procedure developed by Kanigel et al. [Phys.Rev.B 71, 224511 (2005)].
\lambda_ab at T=0K was found to increase with decreasing doping from
\lambda_ab(0)=316(19)nm for the x=0.19 sample to \lambda_ab(0)=430(26)nm for
the x=0.11 one. From a comparison of the present Na-CCOC data with those of
Bi2201 and La214 cuprate superconductors it is concluded that substitution of
the apical oxygen by chlorine decreases the coupling between the
superconducting CuO_2 planes, leading to an enhancement of the two-dimensional
properties of Na-CCOC.",2007-03-27T18:54:10Z
Uniform plasma oscillations in ellipsoid of conductive material,"The influence of the shape of a sample on the type of uniform dipole
collective electrons oscillations is discussed. In samples of a bulk shape
uniform bulk dipole oscillation (Langmuir oscillation) cannot exist. It exists
in samples of a thin slab shape only. As uniform bulk dipole oscillations
cannot penetrate ellipsoidal samples of conductive material, they exist in the
surface layer of a sample only (Mie oscillations). Frequencies of Mie
oscillations are alculated for a sample of the shape of an arbitrary ellipsoid.",2007-02-04T20:54:13Z

"Model Reduction Applied to Square to Rectangular Martensitic
  Transformations Using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition","Model reduction using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is
applied to the dynamics of ferroelastic patches to study the first order square
to rectangular phase transformations. Governing equations for the system
dynamics are constructed by using the Landau-Ginzburg theory and are solved
numerically. By using the POD method, a set of empirical orthogonal basis
functions is first constructed, then the system is projected onto the subspace
spanned by a small set of basis functions determined by the associated singular
values. The performance of the low dimensional model is verified by simulating
nonlinear thermo-mechanical waves and square to rectangular transformations in
a ferroelastic patch. Comparison between numerical results obtained from the

"A statistical mechanics approach for scale-free networks and
  finite-scale networks","We present a statistical mechanics approach for the description of complex
networks. We first define an energy and an entropy associated to a degree
distribution which have a geometrical interpretation. Next we evaluate the
distribution which extremize the free energy of the network. We find two
important limiting cases: a scale-free degree distribution and a finite-scale
degree distribution. The size of the space of allowed simple networks given
these distribution is evaluated in the large network limit. Results are
compared with simulations of algorithms generating these networks.",2007-03-07T18:31:10Z
Graph Operations on Clique-Width Bounded Graphs,"Clique-width is a well-known graph parameter. Many NP-hard graph problems
admit polynomial-time solutions when restricted to graphs of bounded
clique-width. The same holds for NLC-width. In this paper we study the behavior
of clique-width and NLC-width under various graph operations and graph
transformations. We give upper and lower bounds for the clique-width and
NLC-width of the modified graphs in terms of the clique-width and NLC-width of
the involved graphs.",2007-01-29T14:36:25Z
Matter Wave Scattering and Guiding by Atomic Arrays,"We investigate the possibility that linear arrays of atoms can guide matter
waves, much as fiber optics guide light. We model the atomic line as a quasi-1D
array of s wave point scatterers embedded in 2D. Our theoretical study reveals
how matter wave guiding arises from the interplay of scattering phenomena with
bands and conduction along the array. We discuss the conditions under which a
straight or curved array of atoms can guide a beam focused at one end of the
array.",2007-03-07T15:00:09Z
A Generalized Rate Model for Neuronal Ensembles,"There has been a long-standing controversy whether information in neuronal
networks is carried by the firing rate code or by the firing temporal code. The
current status of the rivalry between the two codes is briefly reviewed with
the recent studies such as the brain-machine interface (BMI). Then we have
proposed a generalized rate model based on the {\it finite} $N$-unit Langevin
model subjected to additive and/or multiplicative noises, in order to
understand the firing property of a cluster containing $N$ neurons. The
stationary property of the rate model has been studied with the use of the
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) method. Our rate model is shown to yield various
kinds of stationary distributions such as the interspike-interval distribution
expressed by non-Gaussians including gamma, inverse-Gaussian-like and
log-normal-like distributions.
  The dynamical property of the generalized rate model has been studied with
the use of the augmented moment method (AMM) which was developed by the author
[H. Hasegawa, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 75 (2006) 033001]. From the macroscopic point
of view in the AMM, the property of the $N$-unit neuron cluster is expressed in
terms of {\it three} quantities; $\mu$, the mean of spiking rates of $R=(1/N)
\sum_i r_i$ where $r_i$ denotes the firing rate of a neuron $i$ in the cluster:
$\gamma$, averaged fluctuations in local variables ($r_i$): $\rho$,
fluctuations in global variable ($R$). We get equations of motions of the three
quantities, which show $\rho \sim \gamma/N$ for weak couplings. This implies
that the population rate code is generally more reliable than the single-neuron
rate code. Our rate model is extended and applied to an ensemble containing
multiple neuron clusters.",2007-03-20T05:25:33Z
DNA toroid condensation as analytic solutions,"It now becomes apparent that condensed DNA toroid which emerges in a poor
solvent condition can be realised in the framework of the non-linear sigma
model on a line segment. In fact, the classical solutions of the model, i.e.,
of the bending potential exhibit toroidal forms, and fit well with the
delta-function term of the attractive interaction. The proposed theory is in
good agreement with experimental observations that the toroid is the ground
state. In this paper, we give a rigorous proof that the solutions are indeed
the exact solutions of the equations of motion with the first derivatives of
the attractive interaction term. We also show a refined mapping to experimental
data, considering the finite size effects of the cross section and of the chain
length.",2007-01-30T09:04:30Z
Energy Band Gap Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbons,"We investigate electronic transport in lithographically patterned graphene
ribbon structures where the lateral confinement of charge carriers creates an
energy gap near the charge neutrality point. Individual graphene layers are
contacted with metal electrodes and patterned into ribbons of varying widths
and different crystallographic orientations. The temperature dependent
conductance measurements show larger energy gaps opening for narrower ribbons.
The sizes of these energy gaps are investigated by measuring the conductance in
the non-linear response regime at low temperatures. We find that the energy gap
scales inversely with the ribbon width, thus demonstrating the ability to
engineer the band gap of graphene nanostructures by lithographic processes.",2007-02-22T03:44:22Z
Thermodynamic fluctuation relation for temperature and energy,"The present work extends the well-known thermodynamic relation $C=\beta ^{2}<
\delta {E^{2}}>$ for the canonical ensemble. We start from the general
situation of the thermodynamic equilibrium between a large but finite system of
interest and a generalized thermostat, which we define in the course of the
paper. The resulting identity $< \delta \beta \delta {E}> =1+< \delta {E^{2}}%
> \partial ^{2}S(E) /\partial {E^{2}}$ can account for thermodynamic states
with a negative heat capacity $C<0$; at the same time, it represents a
thermodynamic fluctuation relation that imposes some restrictions on the
determination of the microcanonical caloric curve $\beta (E) =\partial S(E)
/\partial E$. Finally, we comment briefly on the implications of the present
result for the development of new Monte Carlo methods and an apparent analogy
with quantum mechanics.",2007-02-01T22:40:42Z
"Formal proof for delayed finite field arithmetic using floating point
  operators","Formal proof checkers such as Coq are capable of validating proofs of
correction of algorithms for finite field arithmetics but they require
extensive training from potential users. The delayed solution of a triangular
system over a finite field mixes operations on integers and operations on
floating point numbers. We focus in this report on verifying proof obligations
that state that no round off error occurred on any of the floating point
operations. We use a tool named Gappa that can be learned in a matter of
minutes to generate proofs related to floating point arithmetic and hide
technicalities of formal proof checkers. We found that three facilities are
missing from existing tools. The first one is the ability to use in Gappa new
lemmas that cannot be easily expressed as rewriting rules. We coined the second
one ``variable interchange'' as it would be required to validate loop
interchanges. The third facility handles massive loop unrolling and argument
instantiation by generating traces of execution for a large number of cases. We
hope that these facilities may sometime in the future be integrated into
mainstream code validation.",2007-03-06T14:55:44Z
"Excitations in a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate of

stationary state is analytically studied in different geometries. A diffusive
behaviour of the Goldstone mode is found in the spatially homogeneous case and
new features are predicted for the Josephson effect in a two-well geometry.",2007-02-19T10:34:18Z
Symmetry and transport property of spin current induced spin-Hall effect,"We study the spin current induced spin-Hall effect that a longitudinal spin
dependent chemical potential $qV_{s=x,y,z}$ induces a transverse spin
conductances $G^{ss'}$. A four terminal system with Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the scattering region is considered. By using
Landauer-B$\ddot u$ttiker formula with the aid of the Green function, various
spin current induced spin-Hall conductances $G^{ss'}$ are calculated. With the
charge chemical potential $qV_c$ or spin chemical potential $qV_{s=x,y,z}$,
there are 16 elements for the transverse conductances $G^{\mu
\nu}_p=J_{p,\mu}/V_{\nu}$ where $\mu,\nu=x,y,z,c$. Due to the symmetry of our
system these elements are not independent. For the system with $C_2$ symmetry
half of elements are zero, when the center region only exists the Rashba SOI or
Dresselhaus SOI. The numerical results show that of all the conductance
elements, the spin current induced spin-Hall conductances $G^{ss'}$ are usually
much greater (about one or two orders of magnitude) than the spin Hall
conductances $G^{sc}$ and the reciprocal spin Hall conductances $G^{cs}$. So
the spin current induced spin-Hall effect is dominating in the present device.",2007-02-27T13:12:14Z
Aperture Increase Options for the Dutch Open Telescope,"This paper is an invitation to the international community to participate in
the usage and a substantial upgrade of the Dutch Open Telescope on La Palma
(DOT, \url{http://dot.astro.uu.nl}).
  We first give a brief overview of the approach, design, and current science
capabilities of the DOT.
  The DOT database (\url{http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl/DOT}) now contains many
tomographic image sequences with 0.2-0.3 arcsec resolution and up to multi-hour
duration. You are welcome to pull them over for analysis.
  The main part of this contribution outlines DOT upgrade designs implementing
larger aperture. The motivation for aperture increase is the recognition that
optical solar physics needs the substantially larger telescope apertures that
became useful with the advent of adaptive optics and viable through the DOT's
open principle, both for photospheric polarimetry at high resolution and high
sensitivity and for chromospheric fine-structure diagnosis at high cadence and
full spectral sampling.
  Realization of an upgrade requires external partnership(s). This report about
DOT upgrade options therefore serves also as initial documentation for
potential partners.",2007-03-25T13:58:27Z
DC Conductance of Molecular Wires,"Inspired by the work of Kamenev and Kohn, we present a general discussion of
the two-terminal dc conductance of molecular devices within the framework of
Time Dependent Current-Density Functional Theory. We derive a formally exact
expression for the adiabatic conductance and we discuss the dynamical
corrections. For junctions made of long molecular chains that can be either
metallic or insulating, we derive the exact asymptotic behavior of the
adiabatic conductance as a function of the chain's length. Our results follow
from the analytic structure of the bands of a periodic molecular chain and a
compact expression for the Green's functions. In the case of an insulating
chain, not only do we obtain the exponentially decaying factors, but also the
corresponding amplitudes, which depend very sensitively on the electronic
properties of the contacts. We illustrate the theory by a numerical study of a
simple insulating structure connected to two metallic jellium leads.",2007-02-08T03:31:20Z

  Pr_2-xCe_xCuO_{4-δ}","We report resistivity and Hall effect measurements in electron-doped
Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ films in magnetic field up to 58 T. In
contrast to hole-doped cuprates, we find a surprising non-linear magnetic field
dependence of Hall resistivity at high field in the optimally doped and
overdoped films. We also observe a crossover from quadratic to linear field
dependence of the positive magnetoresistance in the overdoped films. A spin
density wave induced Fermi surface reconstruction model can be used to
qualitatively explain both the Hall effect and magnetoresistance.",2007-02-22T21:46:47Z
"Graphic processors to speed-up simulations for the design of high
  performance solar receptors","Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are now powerful and flexible systems
adapted and used for other purposes than graphics calculations (General Purpose
computation on GPU -- GPGPU). We present here a prototype to be integrated into
simulation codes that estimate temperature, velocity and pressure to design
next generations of solar receptors. Such codes will delegate to our
contribution on GPUs the computation of heat transfers due to radiations. We
use Monte-Carlo line-by-line ray-tracing through finite volumes. This means
data-parallel arithmetic transformations on large data structures. Our
prototype is inspired on the source code of GPUBench. Our performances on two
recent graphics cards (Nvidia 7800GTX and ATI RX1800XL) show some speed-up
higher than 400 compared to CPU implementations leaving most of CPU computing
resources available. As there were some questions pending about the accuracy of
the operators implemented in GPUs, we start this report with a survey and some
contributed tests on the various floating point units available on GPUs.",2007-03-06T19:58:17Z
Structure and transport in multi-orbital Kondo systems,"We consider Kondo impurity systems with multiple local orbitals, such as rare
earth ions in a metallic host or multi--level quantum dots coupled to metallic
leads. It is shown that the multiplet structure of the local orbitals leads to
multiple Kondo peaks above the Fermi energy $E_F$, and to ``shadow'' peaks
below $E_F$. We use a slave boson mean field theory, which recovers the strong
coupling Fermi liquid fixed point, to calculate the Kondo peak positions,
widths, and heights analytically at T=0, and NCA calculations to fit the
temperature dependence of high--resolution photoemission spectra of Ce
compounds. In addition, an approximate conductance quantization for transport
through multi--level quantum dots or single--atom transistors in the Kondo
regime due to a generalized Friedel sum rule is demonstrated.",2007-02-25T17:42:11Z
Quantum Rings with Rashba spin orbit coupling: a path integral approach,"We employ a path integral real time approach to compute the DC conductance
and spin polarization for electrons transported across a ballistic Quantum Ring
with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We use a piecewise semiclassical
approximation for the particle orbital motion and solve the spin dynamics
exactly, by accounting for both Zeeman coupling and spin-orbit interaction at
the same time. Within our approach, we are able to study how the interplay
between Berry phase, Ahronov Casher phase, Zeeman interaction and weak
localization corrections influences the quantum interference in the conductance
within a wide range of externally applied fields. Our results are helpful in
inerpreting recent measurements on interferometric rings.",2007-03-08T16:33:27Z
"Exciton condensation in semiconductor quantum wells in nonuniform
  electric field","The structure appearance in exciton density distribution in semiconductor
double quantum well with transverse electric field applied is studied, in the
case when the metal electrode contains a round window. It is suggested that
there is exciton condensed phase, free energy of which can be described by
phenomenological Landau model. For the exciton density determination the
traditional theory of phase transitions was used generated for the case of the
finite exciton lifetime, a presence of the pumping and nonhomogenity of the
system. It is shown that at high exciton density the different types of
structures appear: periodic distribution of exciton condensed phase islands or
condensed phase rings. The behavior of the structures depending on the pumping,
the window size and temperature is analyzed. The obtained results are agreed
with experimental data.",2007-02-16T13:12:07Z
DNA double helices for single molecule electronics,"The combination of self-assembly and electronic properties as well as its
true nanoscale dimensions make DNA a promising candidate for a building block
of single molecule electronics. We argue that the intrinsic double helix
conformation of the DNA strands provides a possibility to drive the electric
current through the DNA by the perpendicular electric (gating) field. The
transistor effect in the poly(G)-poly(C) synthetic DNA is demonstrated within a
simple model approach. We put forward experimental setups to observe the
predicted effect and discuss possible device applications of DNA. In
particular, we propose a design of the single molecule analog of the Esaki
diode.",2007-03-09T13:24:19Z
"Thermohaline mixing: A physical mechanism governing the photospheric
  composition of low-mass giants","Numerous spectroscopic observations provide compelling evidence for a
non-canonical mixing process that modifies the surface abundances of Li, C and
N of low-mass red giants when they reach the bump in the luminosity function.
Eggleton et al. (2006) have proposed that a molecular weight inversion created
by the 3He(3He,2p)4He reaction may be at the origin of this mixing, and relate
it to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In the present work we argue that one is
actually dealing with a double diffusive instability referred to as
thermohaline convection and we discuss its influence on the red giant branch.
We compute stellar models of various initial metallicities using the
prescription by Ulrich (1972) (extended to the case of a non-perfect gas) for
the turbulent diffusivity produced by the thermohaline instability in stellar
radiation zones. Thermohaline mixing simultaneously accounts for the observed
behaviour of the carbon isotopic ratio and of the abundances of Li, C and N on
the upper part of the red giant branch. It reduces significantly the 3He
production with respect to canonical evolution models as required by
measurements of 3He/H in galactic HII regions. Thermohaline mixing is a
fundamental physical process that must be included in stellar evolution
modeling.",2007-03-13T09:58:54Z
Electronic measurement and control of spin transport in Silicon,"The electron spin lifetime and diffusion length are transport parameters that
define the scale of coherence in spintronic devices and circuits. Since these
parameters are many orders of magnitude larger in semiconductors than in
metals, semiconductors could be the most suitable for spintronics. Thus far,
spin transport has only been measured in direct-bandgap semiconductors or in
combination with magnetic semiconductors, excluding a wide range of
non-magnetic semiconductors with indirect bandgaps. Most notable in this group
is silicon (Si), which (in addition to its market entrenchment in electronics)
has long been predicted a superior semiconductor for spintronics with enhanced
lifetime and diffusion length due to low spin-orbit scattering and lattice
inversion symmetry. Despite its exciting promise, a demonstration of coherent
spin transport in Si has remained elusive, because most experiments focused on
magnetoresistive devices; these methods fail because of universal impedance
mismatch obstacles, and are obscured by Lorentz magnetoresistance and Hall
effects. Here we demonstrate conduction band spin transport across 10 microns
undoped Si, by using spin-dependent ballistic hot-electron filtering through
ferromagnetic thin films for both spin-injection and detection. Not based on
magnetoresistance, the hot electron spin-injection and detection avoids
impedance mismatch issues and prevents interference from parasitic effects. The
clean collector current thus shows independent magnetic and electrical control
of spin precession and confirms spin coherent drift in the conduction band of
silicon.",2007-03-01T15:04:51Z
"Determining the Applicability of Agile Practices to Mission and
  Life-critical Systems","Adopting agile practices brings about many benefits and improvements to the
system being developed. However, in mission and life-critical systems, adopting
an inappropriate agile practice has detrimental impacts on the system in
various phases of its lifecycle as well as precludes desired qualities from
being actualized. This paper presents a three-stage process that provides
guidance to organizations on how to identify the agile practices they can
benefit from without causing any impact to the mission and life critical system
being developed.",2007-01-01T05:08:06Z
Non-monotonic Relaxation in Systems with Reentrant Type Interaction,"Recently, interesting non-monotonic time evolution has been pointed out in
the experiments by J\""onsson, {\it et al.} and Jonsson {\it et.al.} and also in
the numerical simulation by Takayama and Hukushima where the magnetic
susceptibility does not monotonically relax to the equilibrium value, but moves
to the opposite side. We study mechanism of this puzzling non-monotonic
dynamical property in a frustrated Ising model in which the equilibrium
correlation exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence (reentrant type). We
study the time evolution of spin correlation function after sudden change of
temperature. There, we find that the value of the correlation function shows
non-monotonic relaxation, and analyze mechanisms of the non-monotonicity. We
also point out that competition between different configurations widely causes
non-monotonic relaxation.",2007-02-15T11:58:20Z
"Interaction Between Motor Domains Can Explain the Complex Dynamics of
  Heterodimeric Kinesins","Motor proteins are active enzyme molecules that play a crucial role in many
biological processes. They transform the chemical energy into the mechanical
work and move unidirectionally along rigid cytoskeleton filaments.
Single-molecule experiments suggest that motor proteins, consisting of two
motor domains, move in a hand-over-hand mechanism when each subunit changes
between trailing and leading positions in alternating steps, and these subunits
do not interact with each other. However, recent experiments on heterodimeric
kinesins suggest that the motion of motor domains is not independent, but
rather strongly coupled and coordinated, although the mechanism of these
interactions are not known. We propose a simple discrete stochastic model to
describe the dynamics of homodimeric and heterodimeric two-headed motor
proteins. It is argued that interactions between motor domains modify free
energy landscapes of each motor subunit, and motor proteins still move via the
hand-over-hand mechanism but with different transitions rates. Our calculations
of biophysical properties agree with experimental observations. Several ways to
test the theoretical model are proposed.",2007-03-22T15:23:22Z
Nanoscale data storage,"The object of this article is to review the development of ultrahigh-density,
nanoscale data storage, i.e., nanostorage. As a fundamentally new type of
storage system, the recording mechanisms of nanostorage may be completely
different to those of the traditional devices. Currently, two types of
molecules are being studied for potential application in nanostorage. One is
molecular electronic elements including molecular wires, rectifiers, switches,
and transistors. The other approach employs nanostructured materials such as
nanotubes, nanowires, and nanoparticles. The challenges for nanostorage are not
only the materials, ultrahigh data-densities, fabrication-costs, device
operating temperatures and large-scale integration, but also the development of
the physical principles and models. There are already some breakthroughs
obtained, but it is still unclear what kind of nanostorage systems can
ultimately replace the current silicon based transistors. A promising candidate
may be a molecular-nanostructure hybrid device with sub-5 nm dimensions.",2007-01-29T06:59:30Z
"Intrinsic Heating and Cooling in Adiabatic Processes for Bosons in
  Optical Lattices","We show that by raising the lattice ""adiabatically"" as in all current optical
lattice experiments on bosons, even though the temperature may decrease
initially, it will eventually rise linearly with lattice height, taking the
system further away from quantum degeneracy. This increase is {\rm intrinsic}
and is caused by the {\em adiabatic compression} during the raising of red
detuned lattices. However, the origin of this heating, which is {\em entirely
different} from that in the bulk, also shows that one can {\em reverse} the
temperature rise to reach quantum degeneracy by {\em adiabatic expansion},
which can be achieved by using blue detuned lasers.",2007-03-07T06:43:36Z
"Long-range correlated random field and random anisotropy O(N) models: A
  functional renormalization group study","We study the long-distance behavior of the O(N) model in the presence of
random fields and random anisotropies correlated as ~1/x^{d-sigma} for large
separation x using the functional renormalization group. We compute the fixed
points and analyze their regions of stability within a double epsilon=d-4 and
sigma expansion. We find that the long-range disorder correlator remains
analytic but generates short-range disorder whose correlator develops the usual
cusp. This allows us to obtain the phase diagrams in (d,sigma,N) parameter
space and compute the critical exponents to first order in epsilon and sigma.
We show that the standard renormalization group methods with a finite number of
couplings used in previous studies of systems with long-range correlated random
fields fail to capture all critical properties. We argue that our results may
be relevant to the behavior of He-3A in aerogel.",2007-01-11T18:55:27Z

Are interpolations in metallicity reliable?,"In this proceeding we present the procedure that we have adopted to obtain a
dataset of Padova94 tracks interpolated in metallicity. The procedure requires
special care to avoid spurious features in the resulting grid, thus we have
subdivided tracks in evolutionary phases, we have chosen the suitable
interpolation method and the transition masses. Finally, we have compared our
interpolated dataset with a similar models, Girardi et al. 2000, obtaining a
general good agreement.",2007-03-27T11:45:56Z
"Excited states of quantum many-body interacting systems: A variational
  coupled-cluster description","We extend recently proposed variational coupled-cluster method to describe
excitation states of quantum many-body interacting systems. We discuss, in
general terms, both quasiparticle excitations and quasiparticle-density-wave
excitations (collective modes). In application to quantum antiferromagnets, we
reproduce the well-known spin-wave excitations, i.e. quasiparticle magnons of
spin $\pm 1$. In addition, we obtain new, spin-zero magnon-density-wave
excitations which has been missing in Anserson's spin-wave theory. Implications
of these new collective modes are discussed.",2007-01-19T16:34:03Z
"Hall Conductance of a Two-Dimensional Electron Gas with Spin-Orbit
  Coupling at the Presence of Lateral Periodic Potential","We evaluate the distribution of Hall conductances in magnetic subbands of
two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit (SO) coupling placed in a
periodic potential and perpendicular magnetic field. In this semiconductor
structure the spin-orbit coupling mixes the states of different magnetic
subbands and changes the distribution of their Hall conductances in comparison
with the case of spinless particles. The calculations were made for
semiconductor structures with a weak ($AlGaAs/GaAs$) and relatively strong
($GaAs/InGaAs$) SO and Zeeman interactions. The Hall conductances of fully
occupied magnetic subbands depend on the system parameters and can be changed
when neighboring subbands touch each other. It was shown that in the real
semiconductor structures with relatively strong SO coupling the distribution of
Hall conductance differs from the quantization law predicted by Thouless et
al\cite{Thoul} for systems without spin-orbit coupling. In the case of weak SO
interaction and relatively large lattice period the Hall conductance of
magnetic subbands are the same as for spinless particles, but as the lattice
period decreases and two neighboring subbands touch each other the distribution
of Hall conductances is changed drastically.",2007-01-15T06:24:10Z
"Percolation model for the superconductor-insulator transition in
  granular films","We study the temperature dependence of the superconductor-insulator
transition in granular superconductors. Empirically, these systems are
characterized by very broad resistance tails, which depend exponentially on the
temperature, and the normal state resistance. We model these systems by a
two-dimensional random resistor percolation networks in which the resistance
between two grains is governed either by Josephson junction coupling or by
quasi particle tunneling. Our numerical simulations as well as an effective
medium evaluation explain the experimental results over a wide range of
temperatures and resistances. Using effective medium approximation we find an
analytical expression for the effective resistance of the system and the value
of the critical resistance separating conducting from insulating branches.",2007-01-14T09:34:00Z
"Spin-orbit induced anisotropy in the tunneling magnetoresistance of
  magnetic tunnel junctions","The effects of the spin-orbit interaction on the tunneling magnetoresistance
of magnetic tunnel junctions are investigated. A model in which the
experimentally observed two-fold symmetry of the anisotropic tunneling
magnetoresistance (TAMR) originates from the interference between Dresselhaus
and Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit couplings is formulated. Bias induced changes of
the Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength can result in an inversion of
the TAMR. The theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the TAMR
experimentally observed in epitaxial Fe/GaAs/Au tunnel junctions.",2007-02-16T11:23:44Z
"Nanoscale magnetic structure of ferromagnet/antiferromagnet manganite
  multilayers","Polarized Neutron Reflectometry and magnetometry measurements have been used
to obtain a comprehensive picture of the magnetic structure of a series of
La{2/3}Sr{1/3}MnO{3}/Pr{2/3}Ca{1/3}MnO{3} (LSMO/PCMO) superlattices, with
varying thickness of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) PCMO layers (0<=t_A<=7.6 nm).
While LSMO presents a few magnetically frustrated monolayers at the interfaces
with PCMO, in the latter a magnetic contribution due to FM inclusions within
the AFM matrix was found to be maximized at t_A~3 nm. This enhancement of the
FM moment occurs at the matching between layer thickness and cluster size,
where the FM clusters would find the optimal strain conditions to be
accommodated within the ""non-FM"" material. These results have important
implications for tuning phase separation via the explicit control of strain.",2007-02-15T03:53:10Z
Spin-polarized Fermi superfluids as Bose-Fermi mixtures,"In the strong-coupling BEC region where a Feshbach resonance gives rise to
tightly-bound dimer molecules, we show that a spin-polarized Fermi superfluid
reduces to a simple Bose-Fermi mixture of Bose-condensed dimers and the
leftover unpaired fermions. Using a many-body functional integral formalism,
the Gaussian fluctuations give rise to an induced dimer-dimer interaction
mediated by the unpaired fermions, with the dimer-fermion vertex being given by
the (mean-field) Born approximation. Treating the pairing fluctuations to
quartic order, we show how the action for a spin-polarized Fermi superfluid
reduces to one for a Bose-Fermi mixture. This Bose-Fermi action includes an
expression for the effective dimer-unpaired fermion interaction in a
spin-polarized Fermi superfluid beyond the Born approximation, in the
superfluid phase at finite temperatures. In the low-density limit, we show how
this dimer-fermion interaction gives the s-wave scattering length
$a_{BF}=1.18a_F$ ($a_F$ is the s-wave fermion scattering length), a result
first derived by Skorniakov and Ter-Martirosian in 1957 for three interacting
fermions.",2007-03-16T19:43:34Z
"Rabi oscillations in a quantum dot-cavity system coupled to a non-zero
  temperature phonon bath","We study a quantum dot strongly coupled to a single high-finesse optical
microcavity mode. We use a rotating wave approximation method, commonly used in
ion-laser interactions, tegether with the Lamb-Dicke approximation to obtain an
analytic solution of this problem. The decay of Rabi oscillations because of
the electron-phonon coupling are studied at arbitrary temperature and
analytical expressions for the collapse and revival times are presented.
Analyses without the rotating wave approximation are presented by means of
investigating the energy spectrum.",2007-03-21T15:21:50Z
"A Clumping Independent Diagnostic of Stellar Mass-loss Rates: Rapid
  Clump Destruction in Adiabatic Colliding Winds","Clumping in hot star winds can significantly affect estimates of mass-loss
rates, the inferred evolution of the star and the environmental impact of the
wind. A hydrodynamical simulation of a colliding winds binary (CWB) with clumpy
winds reveals that the clumps are rapidly destroyed after passing through the
confining shocks of the wind-wind collision region (WCR) for reasonable
parameters of the clumps if the flow in the WCR is adiabatic. Despite large
density and temperature fluctuations in the post-shock gas, the overall effect
of the interaction is to smooth the existing structure in the winds. Averaged
over the entire interaction region, the resulting X-ray emission is very
similar to that from the collision of smooth winds. The insensitivity of the
X-ray emission to clumping suggests it is an excellent diagnostic of the
stellar mass-loss rates in wide CWBs, and may prove to be a useful addition to
existing techniques for deriving mass-loss rates, many of which are extremely
sensitive to clumping. Clumpy winds also have implications for a variety of
phenomena at the WCR: particle acceleration may occur throughout the WCR due to
supersonic MHD turbulence, re-acceleration at multiple shocks, and
re-connection; a statistical description of the properties of the WCR may be
required for studies of non-equilibrium ionization and the rate of electron
heating; and the physical mixing of the two winds will be enhanced, as seems
necessary to trigger dust formation.",2007-03-23T17:28:04Z
"The Dynamics of Sustained Reentry in a Loop Model with Discrete Gap
  Junction Resistance","Dynamics of reentry are studied in a one dimensional loop of model cardiac
cells with discrete intercellular gap junction resistance ($R$). Each cell is
represented by a continuous cable with ionic current given by a modified
Beeler-Reuter formulation. For $R$ below a limiting value, propagation is found
to change from period-1 to quasi-periodic ($QP$) at a critical loop length
($L_{crit}$) that decreases with $R$. Quasi-periodic reentry exists from
$L_{crit}$ to a minimum length ($L_{min}$) that is also shortening with $R$.
The decrease of $L_{crit}(R)$ is not a simple scaling, but the bifurcation can
still be predicted from the slope of the restitution curve giving the duration
of the action potential as a function of the diastolic interval. However, the
shape of the restitution curve changes with $R$.",2007-03-25T17:46:40Z
"Thermo-Mechanical Wave Propagation In Shape Memory Alloy Rod With Phase
  Transformations","Many new applications of ferroelastic materials require a better
understanding of their dynamics that often involve phase transformations. In
such cases, an important prerequisite is the understanding of wave propagation
caused by pulse-like loadings. In the present study, a mathematical model is
developed to analyze the wave propagation process in shape memory alloy rods.
The first order martensite transformations and associated thermo-mechanical
coupling effects are accounted for by employing the modified
Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire theory. The Landau-type free energy function is
employed to characterize different phases, while a Ginzburg term is introduced
to account for energy contributions from phase boundaries. The effect of
internal friction is represented by a Rayleigh dissipation term. The resulted
nonlinear system of PDEs is reduced to a differential-algebraic system, and
Chebyshev's collocation method is employed together with the backward
differentiation method. A series of numerical experiments are performed. Wave
propagations caused by impact loadings are analyzed for different initial
temperatures. It is demonstrated that coupled waves will be induced in the
material. Such waves will be dissipated and dispersed during the propagation
process, and phase transformations in the material will complicate their
propagation patterns. Finally, the influence of internal friction and capillary
effects on the process of wave propagation is analyzed numerically.",2007-02-28T17:45:48Z
"Kolmogorov and Kelvin-Wave Cascades of Superfluid Turbulence at T=0:
  What is in Between?","As long as vorticity quantization remains irrelevant for the long-wave
physics, superfluid turbulence supports a regime macroscopically identical to
the Kolmogorov cascade of a normal liquid. At high enough wavenumbers, the
energy flux in the wavelength space is carried by individual Kelvin-wave
cascades on separate vortex lines. We analyze the transformation of the
Kolmogorov cascade into the Kelvin-wave cascade, revealing a chain of three
distinct intermediate cascades, supported by local-induction motion of the
vortex lines, and distinguished by specific reconnection mechanisms. The most
prominent qualitative feature predicted is unavoidable production of vortex
rings of the size of the order of inter-vortex distance.",2007-03-02T02:00:59Z
Crystal asymmetry induces single-atom chain formation in gold nanowires,"We performed density functional theory and tight-binding molecular dynamics
calculations to investigate the formation of suspended linear atom chains when
stretching gold nanowires along the [110] crystal orientation. We determined
that chain formation can occur only when the crystal symmetry is broken in the
early stages of the elongation process. Such crystallographic asymmetry can be
induced by stretching the wire along a slightly off-axis tensile direction or
by introducing thermal fluctuations. Our observation of the off-axis formation
of these chains agrees with experimental findings.",2007-03-12T22:59:25Z
Dynamical control of electron spin coherence in a quantum dot,"We investigate the performance of dynamical decoupling methods at suppressing
electron spin decoherence from a low-temperature nuclear spin reservoir in a
quantum dot. The controlled dynamics is studied through exact numerical
simulation, with emphasis on realistic pulse delays and long-time limit. Our
results show that optimal performance for this system is attained by a periodic
protocol exploiting concatenated design, with control rates substantially
slower than expected from the upper spectral cutoff of the bath. For a known
initial electron spin state, coherence can saturate at long times, signaling
the creation of a stable ``spin-locked'' decoherence-free subspace. Analytical
insight on saturation is obtained for a simple echo protocol, in good agreement
with numerical results.",2007-01-21T17:27:52Z
Thermodynamics with generalized ensembles: The class of dual orthodes,"We address the problem of the foundation of generalized ensembles in
statistical physics. The approach is based on Boltzmann's concept of orthodes.
These are the statistical ensembles that satisfy the heat theorem, according to
which the heat exchanged divided by the temperature is an exact differential.
This approach can be seen as a mechanical approach alternative to the well
established information-theoretic one based on the maximization of generalized
information entropy. Our starting point are the Tsallis ensembles which have
been previously proved to be orthodes, and have been proved to interpolate
between canonical and microcanonical ensembles. Here we shall see that the
Tsallis ensembles belong to a wider class of orthodes that include the most
diverse types of ensembles. All such ensembles admit both a microcanonical-like
parametrization (via the energy), and a canonical-like one (via the parameter
$\beta$). For this reason we name them ``dual''. One central result used to
build the theory is a generalized equipartition theorem. The theory is
illustrated with a few examples and the equivalence of all the dual orthodes is
discussed.",2007-01-23T01:13:56Z
"Quasi-elastic solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation for
  dissipative gases","The solutions of the one-dimensional homogeneous nonlinear Boltzmann equation
are studied in the QE-limit (Quasi-Elastic; infinitesimal dissipation) by a
combination of analytical and numerical techniques. Their behavior at large
velocities differs qualitatively from that for higher dimensional systems. In
our generic model, a dissipative fluid is maintained in a non-equilibrium
steady state by a stochastic or deterministic driving force. The velocity
distribution for stochastic driving is regular and for infinitesimal
dissipation, has a stretched exponential tail, with an unusual stretching
exponent $b_{QE} = 2b$, twice as large as the standard one for the
corresponding $d$-dimensional system at finite dissipation. For deterministic
driving the behavior is more subtle and displays singularities, such as
multi-peaked velocity distribution functions. We classify the corresponding
velocity distributions according to the nature and scaling behavior of such
singularities.",2007-01-22T14:20:55Z
"Calculations of giant magnetoresistance in Fe/Cr trilayers using layer
  potentials determined from {\it ab-initio} methods","The ab initio full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method
explicitly designed for the slab geometry was employed to elucidate the
physical origin of the layer potentials for the trilayers nFe/3Cr/nFe(001),
where n is the number of Fe monolayers. The thickness of the transition-metal
ferromagnet has been ranged from $n=1$ up to n=8 while the spacer thickness was
fixed to 3 monolayers. The calculated potentials were inserted in the
Fuchs-Sondheimer formalism in order to calculate the giant magnetoresistance
(GMR) ratio. The predicted GMR ratio was compared with the experiment and the
oscillatory behavior of the GMR as a function of the ferromagnetic layer
thickness was discussed in the context of the layer potentials. The reported
results confirm that the interface monolayers play a dominant role in the
intrinsic GMR.",2007-01-26T16:42:44Z
"Statistics of Transmission Eigenvalues in Two-Dimensional Quantum
  Cavities: Ballistic versus Stochastic Scattering","We investigate the statistical distribution of transmission eigenvalues in
phase-coherent transport through quantum dots. In two-dimensional ab-initio
simulations for both clean and disordered two-dimensional cavities, we find
markedly different quantum-to-classical crossover scenarios for these two
cases. In particular, we observe the emergence of ``noiseless scattering
states'' in clean cavities, irrespective of sharp-edged entrance and exit lead
mouths. We find the onset of these ''classical'' states to be largely
independent of the cavity's classical chaoticity, but very sensitive with
respect to bulk disorder. Our results suggest that for weakly disordered
cavities the transmission eigenvalue distribution is determined both by
scattering at the disorder potential and the cavity walls. To properly account
for this intermediate parameter regime we introduce a hybrid crossover scheme
which combines previous models that are valid in the ballisic and the
stochastic limit, respectively.",2007-01-08T17:44:32Z
"Vortices and chirality of magnetostatic modes in quasi-2D ferrite disk
  particles","In this paper we show that the vortex states can be created not only in
magnetically soft ""small"" (with the dipolar and exchange energy competition)
cylindrical dots, but also in magnetically saturated ""big"" (when the exchange
is neglected) cylindrical dots. A property associated with a vortex structure
becomes evident from an analysis of confinement phenomena of magnetic
oscillations in a ferrite disk with a dominating role of magnetic-dipolar
(non-exchange-interaction) spectra. In this case the scalar
(magnetostatic-potential) wave functions may have a phase singularity in a
center of a dot. A non-zero azimuth component of the flow velocity demonstrates
the vortex structure. The vortices are guaranteed by the chiral edge states of
magnetic-dipolar modes in a quasi-2D ferrite disk.",2007-02-14T09:34:14Z
"Steady-State Probe-Partitioning FRET: A Simple and Robust Tool for the
  Study of Membrane Phase Behavior","An experimental strategy has been developed specifically for the study of
composition-dependent phase behavior in multi-component artificial membranes.
The strategy is based on steady-state measurements of fluorescence resonance
energy transfer between freely diffusing membrane probe populations, and it is
well suited for the rapid generation of large data sets. Presented in this
paper are the basic principles that guide the experiment's design, the
derivation of an underlying mathematical model that serves to interpret the
data, and experimental results that confirm the model's predictive power.",2007-03-08T16:26:56Z
"X-ray magnetic circular dichroism characterization of GaN/Ga1-xMnxN
  digital ferromagnetic heterostructure","We have investigated the magnetic properties of a GaN/Ga1-xMnxN (x = 0.1)
digital ferromagnetic heterostructure (DFH) showing ferromagnetic behavior
using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD). The Mn L2,3-edge XAS spectra were similar to those of
Ga1-xMnxN random alloy thin films, indicating a substitutional doping of high
concentration Mn into GaN. From the XMCD measurements, it was revealed that
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic Mn atoms coexisted in the Ga1-xMnxN digital
layers. The ferromagnetic moment per Mn atom estimated from XMCD agreed well
with that estimated from SQUID measurements. From these results, we conclude
that the ferromagnetic behavior of the GaN/Ga1-xMnxN DFH sample arises only
from substitutional Mn2+ ions in the Ga1-xMnxN digital layers and not from
ferromagnetic precipitates. Subtle differences were also found from the XMCD
spectra between the electronic states of the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic
Mn2+ ions.",2007-03-19T09:12:51Z
"Contractor-Renormalization approach to frustrated magnets in magnetic
  field","We propose to use the Contractor Renormalization (CORE) technique in order to
derive effective models for quantum magnets in a magnetic field. CORE is a
powerful non-perturbative technique that can reduce the complexity of a given
microscopic model by focusing on the low-energy part. We provide a detailed
analysis of frustrated spin ladders which have been widely studied in the past:
in particular, we discuss how to choose the building block and emphasize the
use of their reduced density matrix. With a good choice of basis, CORE is able
to reproduce the existence or not of magnetization plateaux in the whole phase
diagram contrary to usual perturbation theory. We also address the issue of
plateau formation in two-dimensional bilayers and point out the analogy between
non-frustrated strongly anisotropic models and frustrated SU(2) ones.",2007-03-22T16:33:15Z
On High Explosive Launching of Projectiles for Shock Physics Experiments,"The hydrodynamic operation of the `Forest Flyer' type of explosive launching
system for shock physics projectiles was investigated in detail using one- and
two-dimensional continuum dynamics simulations. The simulations were
insensitive to uncertainties in the material properties, and reproduced
measurements of the projectile. The most commonly-used variant, with an Al
alloy case, was predicted to produce a slightly curved projectile, subjected to
some shock heating, and likely exhibiting some porosity from tensile damage.
The flatness can be improved by using a case of lower shock impedance, such as
polymethyl methacrylate. High-impedance cases, including Al alloys but with
denser materials improving the launching efficiency, can be used if designed
according to the physics of oblique shock reflection. The tensile stress
induced in the projectile depends on the relative thickness of the explosive,
expansion gap, and projectile. The thinner the projectile with respect to the
explosive, the smaller the tensile stress. If the explosive is initiated with a
plane wave lens, the tensile stress is lower than for initiation with multiple
detonators over a plane. The previous plane wave lens designs did however
induce a tensile stress close to the spall strength of the projectile. The
tensile stress can be reduced by changes in the component thicknesses.
Experiments to verify the operation of explosively-launched projectiles should
attempt to measure porosity induced in the projectile: arrival time
measurements may be insensitive to porous regions caused by damaged or
recollected material.",2007-02-28T20:23:04Z
Direct measurements of the fractional quantum Hall effect gaps,"We measure the chemical potential jump across the fractional gap in the
low-temperature limit in the two-dimensional electron system of GaAs/AlGaAs
single heterojunctions. In the fully spin-polarized regime, the gap for filling
factor nu=1/3 increases LINEARLY with magnetic field and is coincident with
that for nu=2/3, reflecting the electron-hole symmetry in the spin-split Landau
level. In low magnetic fields, at the ground-state spin transition for nu=2/3,
a correlated behavior of the nu=1/3 and nu=2/3 gaps is observed.",2007-02-16T12:50:01Z
"Dyadic Green's Functions and Guided Surface Waves for a Surface
  Conductivity Model of Graphene","An exact solution is obtained for the electromagnetic field due to an
electric current in the presence of a surface conductivity model of graphene.
The graphene is represented by an infinitesimally-thin, local and isotropic
two-sided conductivity surface. The field is obtained in terms of dyadic
Green's functions represented as Sommerfeld integrals. The solution of
plane-wave reflection and transmission is presented, and surface wave
propagation along graphene is studied via the poles of the Sommerfeld
integrals. For isolated graphene characterized by complex surface conductivity,
a proper transverse-electric (TE) surface wave exists if and only if the
imaginary part of conductivity is positive (associated with interband
conductivity), and a proper transverse-magnetic (TM) surface wave exists when
the imaginary part of conductivity is negative (associated with intraband
conductivity). By tuning the chemical potential at infrared frequencies, the
sign of the imaginary part of conductivity can be varied, allowing for some
control over surface wave properties.",2007-01-10T17:55:48Z
Entrainment transition in populations of random frequency oscillators,"The entrainment transition of coupled random frequency oscillators is
revisited. The Kuramoto model (global coupling) is shown to exhibit unusual
sample-dependent finite size effects leading to a correlation size exponent
$\bar\nu=5/2$. Simulations of locally coupled oscillators in $d$-dimensions
reveal two types of frequency entrainment: mean-field behavior at $d>4$, and
aggregation of compact synchronized domains in three and four dimensions. In
the latter case, scaling arguments yield a correlation length exponent
$\nu=2/(d-2)$, in good agreement with numerical results.",2007-01-26T11:19:31Z
Josephson Diode,"We propose a new type of Josephson junction formed by two superconductors
close to the superconductor-Mott-insulator transition, one of which is doped
with holes and the other is doped with electrons. A self-organized
Mott-insulating depletion region is formed at the interface between two
superconductors, giving rise to an asymmetric response of current to the
external voltage. The collective excitations of the depletion region result in
a novel phase dynamics that can be measured experimentally in the noise
spectrum of the Josephson current.",2007-03-16T06:39:10Z
"Thermo-kinetic approach of single-particles and clusters involving
  anomalous diffusion under viscoelastic response","We present a thermo-kinetic description of anomalous diffusion of
single-particles and clusters in a viscoelastic medium in terms of a
non-Markovian diffusion equation involving memory functions. The scaling
behaviour of these functions is analyzed by considering hydrodynamics and
cluster-size space random walk arguments. We explain experimental results on
diffusion of Brownian particles in the cytoskeleton, in cluster-cluster
aggregation and in a suspension of micelles.",2007-01-22T13:35:07Z
"Anisotropy in the Hubble constant as observed in the HST Extragalactic
  Distance Scale Key Project results","Based on general relativity, it can be argued that deviations from a uniform
Hubble flow should be thought of as variations in the Universe's expansion
velocity field, rather than being thought of as peculiar velocities with
respect to a uniformly expanding space. The aim of this paper is to use the
observed motions of galaxies to map out variations in the Universe's expansion,
and more importantly, to investigate whether real variations in the Hubble
expansion are detectable given the observational uncertainties. All-sky maps of
the observed variation in the expansion are produced using measurements
obtained along specific lines-of-sight and smearing them across the sky using a
Gaussian profile. A map is produced for the final results of the HST
Extragalactic Distance Scale Key Project for the Hubble constant, a comparison
map is produced from a set of essentially independent data, and Monte Carlo
techniques are used to analyse the statistical significance of the variation in
the maps. A statistically significant difference in expansion rate of 9
km/s/Mpc is found to occur across the sky. Comparing maps of the sky at
different distances appears to indicate two distinct sets of extrema with even
stronger statistically significant variations. Within our supercluster,
variations tend to occur near the supergalactic plane, and beyond our
supercluster, variations tend to occur away from the supergalactic plane.
Comparison with bulk flow studies shows some concordance, yet also suggests the
bulk flow studies may suffer confusion, failing to discern the influence of
multiple perturbations.",2007-03-21T13:08:07Z
A Numerical Renormalization Group for Continuum One-Dimensional Systems,"We present a renormalization group (RG) procedure which works naturally on a
wide class of interacting one-dimension models based on perturbed (possibly
strongly) continuum conformal and integrable models. This procedure integrates
Kenneth Wilson's numerical renormalization group with Al. B. Zamolodchikov's
truncated conformal spectrum approach. Key to the method is that such theories
provide a set of completely understood eigenstates for which matrix elements
can be exactly computed. In this procedure the RG flow of physical observables
can be studied both numerically and analytically. To demonstrate the approach,
we study the spectrum of a pair of coupled quantum Ising chains and correlation
functions in a single quantum Ising chain in the presence of a magnetic field.",2007-01-24T22:34:18Z
"Scenarios of heterogeneous nucleation and growth studied by cell
  dynamics simulation","The dynamics of phase transformation due to homogeneous nucleation has long
been analyzed using the classic Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) theory.
However, the dynamics of phase transformation due to heterogeneous nucleation
has not been studied systematically even though it is vitally important
technologically. In this report, we study the dynamics of heterogeneous
nucleation theoretically and systematically using the phenomenological
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL)-type model combined with the cell
dynamics method. In this study we focus on the dynamics of phase transformation
when the material is sandwiched by two supporting substrates. This model is
supposed to simulates phase change storage media. Since both homogeneous and
heterogeneous nucleation can occur simultaneously, we predict a few scenarios
of phase transformation including: homogeneous-nucleation regime,
heterogeneous-nucleation regime, and the homogeneous-heterogeneous coexistence
regime. These predictions are directly confirmed by numerical simulation using
the TDGL model. The outcome of the study was that the KJMA formula has limited
use when heterogeneous nucleation exist, but it could still give some
information about the microscopic mechanism of phase transformation at various
stages during phase transformation.",2007-02-15T07:59:44Z
"Double superconducting transition in the filled skutterudite PrOs4Sb12
  and sample characterizations","A thorough characterization of many samples of the filled skutterudite
compound PrOs4Sb12 is provided. We find that the double superconducting
transition in the specific heat Tc1~1.89K and Tc2~1.72K tends to appear in
samples with a large residual resistivity ratio, large specific heat jump at
the superconducting transition and with the highest absolute value of the
specific heat above Tc1. However, we present evidence which casts doubt on the
intrinsic nature of the double superconducting transition. The ratio of the two
specific heat jumps \Delta C(Tc1)/\Delta C(Tc2) shows a wide range of values on
crystals from different batches but also within the same batch. This ratio was
strongly reduced by polishing a sample down to 120um. Remarkably, three samples
exhibit a single sharp transition of ~15mK in width at Tc~1.7K. The normalized
specific heat jump (C-Cnormal)/Cnormal at Tc of two of them is higher than ~32%
so larger than the sum of the two specific heat jumps when a double transition
exists. As an evidence of better quality, the slope in the transition is at
least two time steeper.
  We discuss the origins of the double transition; in particular we consider,
based on X-ray diffraction results, a scenario involving Pr-vacancies. The
superconducting phase diagram under magnetic field of a sample with a single
transition is fitted with a two-band model taking into account the good values
for the gap as deduced from thermal conductivity measurements.",2007-03-27T06:54:09Z
"Transport and Helfand moments in the Lennard-Jones fluid. I. Shear
  viscosity","We propose a new method, the Helfand-moment method, to compute the shear
viscosity by equilibrium molecular dynamics in periodic systems. In this
method, the shear viscosity is written as an Einstein-like relation in terms of
the variance of the so-called Helfand moment. This quantity, is modified in
order to satisfy systems with periodic boundary conditions usually considered
in molecular dynamics. We calculate the shear viscosity in the Lennard-Jones
fluid near the triple point thanks to this new technique. We show that the
results of the Helfand-moment method are in excellent agreement with the
results of the standard Green-Kubo method.",2007-01-11T17:52:10Z
"The Universal Rotation Curve of Spiral Galaxies. II The Dark Matter

with a Universal mass profile, and consequently a Universal equilibrium
circular velocity of the virialized objects, as galaxies. In this paper we
obtain, by combining kinematical data of their inner regions with global
observational properties, the Universal Rotation Curve (URC) of disk galaxies
and the corresponding mass distribution out to their virial radius. This curve
extends the results of Paper I, concerning the inner luminous regions of Sb-Im

Holonomy Transformation in the FRW Metric,"In this work we investigate loop variables in Friedman-Robertson-Walker

"AICA: a New Pair Force Evaluation Method for Parallel Molecular Dynamics

Arbitrary Interacting Cells Algorithm (AICA) is designed to operate on
geometrical domains defined by an unstructured, arbitrary polyhedral mesh,
which has been spatially decomposed into irregular portions for
parallelisation. It is intended for nano scale fluid mechanics simulation by MD
in complex geometries, and to provide the MD component of a hybrid MD/continuum

"Investigation of $q$-dependent dynamical heterogeneity in a colloidal
  gel by x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy","We use time-resolved X-Photon Correlation Spectroscopy to investigate the
slow dynamics of colloidal gels made of moderately attractive carbon black
particles. We show that the slow dynamics is temporally heterogeneous and
quantify its fluctuations by measuring the variance $\chi$ of the instantaneous
intensity correlation function. The amplitude of dynamical fluctuations has a
non-monotonic dependence on scattering vector $q$, in stark contrast with
recent experiments on strongly attractive colloidal gels [Duri and Cipelletti,
\textit{Europhys. Lett.} \textbf{76}, 972 (2006)]. We propose a simple scaling
argument for the $q$-dependence of fluctuations in glassy systems that
rationalizes these findings.",2007-02-27T16:07:58Z
"Nonextensibility of internal energy in incomplete statistics and the
  zeroth law of thermodynamics","On the basis of the entropy of incomplete statistics (IS) and the joint
probability factorization condition, two controversial problems existing in IS
are investigated, where one is what the correct expression of the internal
energy for a composite system is and the other is whether the zeroth law of
thermodynamics is true or not. Some new equivalent expressions of the internal
energy of a composite system are derived through a precise mathematical
calculation. Moreover, a self-consistent calculation is used to expound that
the zeroth law of thermodynamics is also suitable for IS, but it can't be
proven from theory. Finally, it is pointed out that the generalized zeroth law
of thermodynamics and the expressions of the internal energy of a composite
system derived in literature are incorrect, because two irrational assumptions
have been implicitly introduced.",2007-02-02T07:06:34Z
"Magnetic Structure and Properties of the S = 5/2 Triangular
  Antiferromagnet $α$-NaFeO$_2$","The magnetic properties of $\alpha$-NaFeO$_2$ are studied by neutron
diffraction and magnetization measurements. An ordered phase with spins aligned
along the b$_hex$ axis exists at low temperatures (T < 4 K). At intermediate
temperatures (4 K < T < 11 K), the system passes through an incommensurate
ordered phase before transforming into a short range ordered state at higher
temperatures that persists up to at least 50 K. Although the short range
ordering does not persist to room temperature according to neutron diffraction,
the magnetic susceptibility does not follow Curie-Weiss behavior, even up to
320 K. This rich magnetic behavior can be understood qualitatively as a
competition between different magnetic exchange interactions that are similar
in magnitude. The delicate balance between these interactions makes
$\alpha$-NaFeO$_2$ a candidate for more detailed theoretical work to understand
magnetic behavior in frustrated magnetic systems.",2007-03-08T03:23:13Z
dc Josephson Effect in Metallic Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes,"The dc Josephson effect is investigated in a single-walled metallic carbon
nanotube connected to two superconducting leads. In particular, by using the
Luttinger liquid theory, we analyze the effects of the electron-electron
interaction on the supercurrent. We find that in the long junction limit the
strong electronic correlations of the nanotube, together with its peculiar band
structure, induce oscillations in the critical current as a function of the
junction length and/or the nanotube electron filling. These oscillations
represent a signature of the Luttinger liquid physics of the nanotube, for they
are absent if the interaction is vanishing. We show that this effect can be
exploited to reverse the sign of the supercurrent, realizing a tunable
\pi-junction.",2007-02-28T12:35:58Z
Why the Standard Data Processing should be changed,"The basic statistical methods of data representation did not change since
their emergence. Their simplicity was dictated by the intricacies of
computations in the before computers epoch. It turns out that such approach is
not uniquely possible in the presence of quick computers. The suggested here
method improves significantly the reliability of data processing and their
graphical representation. In this paper we show problems of the standard data
processing which can bring to incorrect results. A method solving these
problems is proposed. It is based on modification of data representation. The
method was implemented in a computer program Consensus5. The program
performances are illustrated through varied examples.",2007-03-08T19:49:35Z
Recoiling from a kick in the head-on collision of spinning black holes,"Recoil ``kicks'' induced by gravitational radiation are expected in the
inspiral and merger of black holes. Recently the numerical relativity community
has begun to measure the significant kicks found when both unequal masses and
spins are considered. Because understanding the cause and magnitude of each
component of this kick may be complicated in inspiral simulations, we consider
these effects in the context of a simple test problem. We study recoils from
collisions of binaries with initially head-on trajectories, starting with the
simplest case of equal masses with no spin and then adding spin and varying the
mass ratio, both separately and jointly. We find spin-induced recoils to be
significant relative to unequal-mass recoils even in head-on configurations.
Additionally, it appears that the scaling of transverse kicks with spins is
consistent with post-Newtonian theory, even though the kick is generated in the
nonlinear merger interaction, where post-Newtonian theory should not apply.
This suggests that a simple heuristic description might be effective in the
estimation of spin-kicks.",2007-02-02T20:55:18Z
Suppression of Visibility in a Two-Electron Mach-Zehnder Interferometer,"We investigate the suppression of the visibility of Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations in a two-electron Mach-Zehnder interferometer that leaves the
single-electron current unchanged. In the case when the sources emit either
spin-polarized or entangled electrons, partial distinguishability of electrons
(coming from two different sources) suppresses the visibility. Two-particle
entanglement may produce behavior similar to ""dephasing"" of two-particle
interferometry.",2007-03-07T15:31:55Z
Switchable coupling between charge and flux qubits,"We propose a hybrid quantum circuit with both charge and flux qubits
connected to a large Josephson junction that gives rise to an effective
inter-qubit coupling controlled by the external magnetic flux. This switchable
inter-qubit coupling can be used to transfer back and forth an arbitrary
superposition state between the charge qubit and the flux qubit working at the
optimal point. The proposed hybrid circuit provides a promising quantum memory
because the flux qubit at the optimal point can store the tranferred quantum
state for a relatively long time.",2007-03-01T06:55:12Z
Two-Parameter Scaling Law of the Anderson Transition,"It is shown that the Anderson transition (AT) in 3d obeys a two-parameter
scaling law, derived from a pair of anisotropic scaling transformations, and
corresponding critical exponents and scaling function calculated, using a
high-precision numerical finite-size scaling study of the smallest Lyapunov
exponent of quasi-1d systems of rectangular cross-section of L times l atoms in
the limit of infinite L and l < L, for x=l/L ranging from 1/30 to 1/4. The
second parameter is x, and there are two singularities: apart from the
two-parameter scaling describing AT for x>0, corrections to scaling due to the
irrelevant scaling field diverge when x->0, and the corresponding crossover
length scale is also estimated. Furthermore, results suggest that the
signatures of the AT in 3d should be present also in 2d strongly localized
regime.",2007-03-03T11:08:32Z
"Unified static renormalization-group treatment of finite-temperature
  crossovers close to a quantum critical point","A nonconventional renormalization-group (RG) treatment close to and below
four dimensions is used to explore, in a unified and systematic way, the
low-temperature properties of a wide class of systems in the influence domain
of their quantum critical point. The approach consists in a preliminary
averaging over quantum degrees of freedom and a successive employment of the
Wilsonian RG transformation to treat the resulting effective classical
Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional. This allows us to perform a detailed
study of criticality of the quantum systems under study. The emergent physics
agrees, in many aspects, with the known quantum critical scenario. However, a
richer structure of the phase diagram appears with additional crossovers which
are not captured by the traditional RG studies. In addition, in spite of the
intrinsically static nature of our theory, predictions about the dynamical
critical exponent, which parametrizes the link between statics and dynamics
close to a continuous phase transition, are consistently derived from our
static results.",2007-01-15T16:52:10Z
"Syndrome Decoding of Reed-Solomon Codes Beyond Half the Minimum Distance
  based on Shift-Register Synthesis","In this paper, a new approach for decoding low-rate Reed-Solomon codes beyond
half the minimum distance is considered and analyzed. Unlike the Sudan
algorithm published in 1997, this new approach is based on multi-sequence
shift-register synthesis, which makes it easy to understand and simple to
implement. The computational complexity of this shift-register based algorithm
is of the same order as the complexity of the well-known Berlekamp-Massey
algorithm. Moreover, the error correcting radius coincides with the error
correcting radius of the original Sudan algorithm, and the practical decoding
performance observed on a q-ary symmetric channel (QSC) is virtually identical
to the decoding performance of the Sudan algorithm. Bounds for the failure and
error probability as well as for the QSC decoding performance of the new
algorithm are derived, and the performance is illustrated by means of examples.",2007-02-22T15:55:31Z
Measurement of energy eigenstates by a slow detector,"We propose a method for a weak continuous measurement of the energy
eigenstates of a fast quantum system by means of a ""slow"" detector. Such a
detector is only sensitive to slowly-changing variables, e. g. energy, while
its back-action can be limited solely to decoherence of the eigenstate
superpositions. We apply this scheme to the problem of detection of quantum
jumps between energy eigenstates in a harmonic oscillator.",2007-02-04T05:37:04Z
"Crystalline phases in chiral ferromagnets: Destabilization of helical
  order","In chiral ferromagnets, weak spin-orbit interactions twist the ferromagnetic
order into spirals, leading to helical order. We investigate an extended
Ginzburg-Landau theory of such systems where the helical order is destabilized
in favor of crystalline phases. These crystalline phases are based on periodic
arrangements of double-twist cylinders and are strongly reminiscent of blue
phases in liquid crystals. We discuss the relevance of such blue phases for the
phase diagram of the chiral ferromagnet MnSi.",2007-02-12T19:21:34Z
What is the optimum stellar rotation rate for a collapsar?,"We consider low angular momentum, neutrino cooled accretion flows onto
newborn black holes in the context of the collapsar model for long Gamma Ray
Bursts, and find a considerable energy release for rotation rates lower than
those usually considered. The efficiency for the transformation of
gravitational binding energy into radiation is maximized when the equatorial
angular momentum l0 ~ 2 Rg c, where Rg is the Schwarzschild radius.",2007-03-01T21:40:23Z
Time Evolution of the Neel State,"A quasionedimentional spin chain (s=1/2) is considered as a lattice
consisting of two sublattices. The attention is paid to the states which are
pure spin states of the whole lattice and both sublattices, the value of the
sublattices' spins being maximum. It is shown that the Neel state can be
considered as a superposition of such states. The exact equation for this
superposition coefficients is developed.
  The possibility of the Neel state to be the eigenstate of a Hamiltonian is
discussed. Several model Hamiltonians are examined, the well known ones and few
novel Hamiltonians being considered. The time evolution of the Neel state in
different models is studied with the help of Fock-Krylov method.",2007-01-04T05:44:12Z
"Fractional quantum Hall effect in a quantum point contact at filling
  fraction 5/2","Recent theories suggest that the excitations of certain quantum Hall states
may have exotic braiding statistics which could be used to build topological
quantum gates. This has prompted an experimental push to study such states
using confined geometries where the statistics can be tested. We study the
transport properties of quantum point contacts (QPCs) fabricated on a
GaAs/AlGaAs two dimensional electron gas that exhibits well-developed
fractional quantum Hall effect, including at bulk filling fraction 5/2. We find
that a plateau at effective QPC filling factor 5/2 is identifiable in point
contacts with lithographic widths of 1.2 microns and 0.8 microns, but not 0.5
microns. We study the temperature and dc-current-bias dependence of the 5/2
plateau in the QPC, as well as neighboring fractional and integer plateaus in
the QPC while keeping the bulk at filling factor 3. Transport near QPC filling
factor 5/2 is consistent with a picture of chiral Luttinger liquid edge-states
with inter-edge tunneling, suggesting that an incompressible state at 5/2 forms
in this confined geometry.",2007-03-06T18:58:52Z
Evaporating (2+1)-dimensional black strings,"We investigate (2+1)-dimensional black strings in the Kaluza-Klein spacetime.
The system is classically stable as long as the horizon size is much larger
than the size of the compact space. Semiclassically, however, the horizon size
shrinks gradually due to the energy loss through the Hawking radiation.
Eventually, the system will enter into the regime of the Gregory-Laflamme
instability and get destabilized. Subsequently, the spherically symmetric black
hole is formed and evaporated in the usual manner. This standard picture may be
altered by the dynamics of the internal space which induced by the Hawking
radiation. We argue that the black string is excised from the Kaluza-Klein
spacetime before the onset of the Gregory-Laflamme instability and therefore
before the evaporation.",2007-01-25T08:07:51Z
Semimetal to semimetal charge density wave transition in 1T-TiSe$_2$,"We report an infrared study on 1$T$-TiSe$_2$, the parent compound of the
newly discovered superconductor Cu$_x$TiSe$_2$. Previous studies of this
compound have not conclusively resolved whether it is a semimetal or a
semiconductor: information that is important in determining the origin of its
unconventional CDW transition. Here we present optical spectroscopy results
that clearly reveal that the compound is metallic in both the high-temperature
normal phase and the low-temperature CDW phase. The carrier scattering rate is
dramatically different in the normal and CDW phases and the carrier density is
found to change with temperature. We conclude that the observed properties can
be explained within the scenario of an Overhauser-type CDW mechanism.",2007-03-07T00:34:39Z
Appearance of ferroelectricity in thin films of incipient ferroelectric,"The consideration of size-induced ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition
for conventional and incipient ferroelectrics thin films with perovskite
structure was carried out in phenomenological theory framework of
Ginsburg-Landau-Devonshire. The more general form of surface free energy
expansion that includes intrinsic surface stress tensor, surface piezoelectric
effect and electrostriction as well as quadratic and quartic powers of surface
polarization has been considered. The analytical expressions for thickness
dependence of transition temperature was derived both for the conventional and
incipient ferroelectrics. It was shown that although there is no
ferroelectricity in the bulk incipient ferroelectrics it appears in thin film
for the negative extrapolation length that is realized e.g. at positive surface
stress coefficient and negative or zero misfit strain. In our consideration we
came to the conclusion about thickness induced ferroelectricity in incipient
ferroelectrics KTaO3 at room temperature for the thin enough films. The similar
surface effects can influence strongly on the phase transitions in the thin
films of another incipient ferroelectrics, SrTiO3.",2007-03-27T18:52:34Z
"First-principles calculation of mechanical properties of Si <001>
  nanowires and comparison to nanomechanical theory","We report the results of first-principles density functional theory
calculations of the Young's modulus and other mechanical properties of
hydrogen-passivated Si <001> nanowires. The nanowires are taken to have
predominantly {100} surfaces, with small {110} facets according to the Wulff
shape. The Young's modulus, the equilibrium length and the constrained residual
stress of a series of prismatic beams of differing sizes are found to have size
dependences that scale like the surface area to volume ratio for all but the
smallest beam. The results are compared with a continuum model and the results
of classical atomistic calculations based on an empirical potential. We
attribute the size dependence to specific physical structures and interactions.
In particular, the hydrogen interactions on the surface and the charge density
variations within the beam are quantified and used both to parameterize the
continuum model and to account for the discrepancies between the two models and
the first-principles results.",2007-02-22T19:00:21Z
Theoretical X-Ray Absorption Debye-Waller Factors,"An approach is presented for theoretical calculations of the Debye-Waller
factors in x-ray absorption spectra. These factors are represented in terms of
the cumulant expansion up to third order. They account respectively for the net
thermal expansion $\sigma^{(1)}(T)$, the mean-square relative displacements
$\sigma^2(T)$, and the asymmetry of the pair distribution function
$\sigma^{(3)}(T)$. Similarly, we obtain Debye-Waller factors for x-ray and
neutron scattering in terms of the mean-square vibrational amplitudes $u^2(T)$.
Our method is based on density functional theory calculations of the dynamical
matrix, together with an efficient Lanczos algorithm for projected phonon
spectra within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Due to anharmonicity in the
interatomic forces, the results are highly sensitive to variations in the
equilibrium lattice constants, and hence to the choice of exchange-correlation
potential. In order to treat this sensitivity, we introduce two prescriptions:
one based on the local density approximation, and a second based on a modified
generalized gradient approximation. Illustrative results for the leading
cumulants are presented for several materials and compared with experiment and
with correlated Einstein and Debye models. We also obtain Born-von Karman
parameters and corrections due to perpendicular vibrations.",2007-02-16T19:08:04Z
"Chandra and HST observations of gamma-ray blazars: comparing jet

the basis of radio morphology with the aim of revealing X-ray and optical
emission from their jets at large scales. All the sources have been detected.
Spectral Energy Distributions of the large scale jets are obtained as well as
new X-ray spectra for the blazar cores. Modeling for each object the core
(sub-pc scale) and large-scale (>100 kpc) jet SEDs, we derive the properties of
the same jet at the two scales. The comparison of speeds and powers at
different scales supports a simple scenario for the dynamics and propagation of
high power relativistic jets.",2007-03-14T13:17:14Z
"Discovery of a nearby L-T transition object in the Southern Galactic
  plane","We present the discovery of 2MASS J11263991-5003550 identified as part of an
ongoing survey to discover ultra-cool dwarfs in the Southern Galactic Plane,
using data from the 2MASS and SuperCOSMOS Sky Surveys. Strong FeH and H2O
absorption features in the near-infrared JH-band spectrum reveal
characteristics seen in both mid-L, and L-T transition type dwarfs. We suggest
these may be attributable to holes in the condensate cloud layers in the
atmosphere of a single sub-stellar object, but cannot at present completely
rule out the role of binarity as the possible cause. We also identify this
object as a blue L dwarf, and explore the similar observable characteristics of
these objects with those of the L-T transition. From this comparison we suggest
that the temperature (and thus spectral type) at which the condensate cloud
later begins to break-up/rain out, may be highly sensitive to small variations
in metallicity. However, the JH-band spectrum of this object does not resemble
that of the known L sub-dwarfs, and therefore extreme metal deficiency may not
in fact be responsible for the discordant features. We estimate a spectral type
of L9+/-1, and measure a large proper-motion of \mu_(tot)=1.65""+/-0.03"" per
year. Also, a spectrophotometric distance of 8.2pc is estimated, possibly
making this object the nearest easily observable single L-T transition object
in the southern hemisphere.",2007-03-30T18:12:53Z

Optical studies of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC1313 X-2,"NGC1313 X-2 was among the first ultraluminous X-ray sources discovered, and

edge of a young cluster of $\le10^7$ years amid a dominant old stellar
population. Its spectral energy distribution is consistent with that for a
Z=0.004 star with 8.5 $M_\odot$ about $5\times10^6$ years old, or for an O7 V
star at solar metallicity. The counterpart exhibited significant variability of

factor of 2-3 andwith periods of a tenth seconds to several hours, depending on
the black hole masses. The shock oscillation model may explain the intermediate
frequency QPOs with 1-10 Hz observed in the stellar-mass black hole candidates
and also suggest the existence of QPOs with the period of hours in AGNs. When
the accretion rate is low, the luminosity increases in proportion to the
accretion rate. However, when the accretion rate exceeds greatly the Eddington
critical rate \dot M_E, the luminosity is insensitive to the accretion rate and
is kept constantly around 3 L_E. On the other hand, the mass-outflow rate
increases in proportion to the accretion rate and it amounts to about a few
percent of theinput mass-flow rate.",2007-03-17T04:45:07Z
"Origins of Eccentric Extrasolar Planets: Testing the Planet-Planet
  Scattering Model","(Abridged) In planetary systems with two or more giant planets, dynamical
instabilities can lead to collisions or ejections through strong planet--planet
scattering. Previous studies for simple initial configurations with two
equal-mass planets revealed some discrepancies between the results of numerical
simulations and the observed orbital elements of extrasolar planets. Here, we
show that simulations with two unequal mass planets starting on nearly circular
orbits predict a reduced frequency of collisions and a broader range of final
eccentricities. The two-planet scattering model can easily reproduce the
observed eccentricities with a plausible distribution of planet mass ratios.
Further, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity of
about 0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided that
both planets are initially place on nearly circular orbits. This compares
favorably with current observations and will be tested by future planet
discoveries. The combination of planet--planet scattering and tidal
circularization may be able to explain the existence of some giant planets with
very short period orbits. Orbital migration due to planet scattering could play
an important role in explaining the increased rate of giant planets with very
short period orbits. We also re-examine and discuss various possible
correlations between eccentricities and other properties of observed extrasolar
planets. We demonstrate that the observed distribution of planet masses,
orbital periods, and eccentricities can provide constraints for models of
planet formation and evolution.",2007-03-07T23:49:20Z
Semiclassical and quantum polarons in crystaline acetanilide,"Crystalline acetanilide is a an organic solid with peptide bond structure
similar to that of proteins. Two states appear in the amide I spectral region
having drastically different properties: one is strongly temperature dependent
and disappears at high temperatures while the other is stable at all
temperatures. Experimental and theoretical work over the past twenty five years
has assigned the former to a selftrapped state while the latter to an extended
free exciton state. In this article we review the experimental and theoretical
developments on acetanilide paying particular attention to issues that are
still pending. Although the interpretation of the states is experimentally
sound, we find that specific theoretical comprehension is still lacking. Among
the issues that that appear not well understood is the effective dimensionality
of the selftrapped polaron and free exciton states.",2007-02-27T13:50:22Z
Nanosecond quantum state detection in a current biased dc SQUID,"This article presents our procedure to measure the quantum state of a dc
SQUID within a few nanoseconds, using an adiabatic dc flux pulse. Detection of
the ground state is governed by standard macroscopic quantum theory (MQT), with
a small correction due to residual noise in the bias current. In the two level
limit, where the SQUID constitutes a phase qubit, an observed contrast of 0.54
indicates a significant loss in contrast compared to the MQT prediction. It is
attributed to spurious depolarization (loss of excited state occupancy) during
the leading edge of the adiabatic flux measurement pulse. We give a simple
phenomenological relaxation model which is able to predict the observed
contrast of multilevel Rabi oscillations for various microwave amplitudes.",2007-02-20T08:25:12Z
Designing phoretic micro- and nano-swimmers,"Small objects can swim by generating around them fields or gradients which in
turn induce fluid motion past their surface by phoretic surface effects. We
quantify for arbitrary swimmer shapes and surface patterns, how efficient
swimming requires both surface ``activity'' to generate the fields, and surface
``phoretic mobility.'' We show in particular that (i) swimming requires
symmetry breaking in either or both of the patterns of ""activity"" and
``mobility,'' and (ii) for a given geometrical shape and surface pattern, the
swimming velocity is size-independent. In addition, for given available surface
properties, our calculation framework provides a guide for optimizing the
design of swimmers.",2007-01-09T11:40:10Z
"Transport and Helfand moments in the Lennard-Jones fluid. II. Thermal
  Conductivity","The thermal conductivity is calculated with the Helfand-moment method in the
Lennard-Jones fluid near the triple point. The Helfand moment of thermal
conductivity is here derived for molecular dynamics with periodic boundary
conditions. Thermal conductivity is given by a generalized Einstein relation

The agreement is excellent.",2007-01-11T17:54:30Z
"Mesoscopic Magnetic States in Metallic Alloys with Strong Electronic
  Correlations: A Percolative Scenario for CeNi$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$","We present evidence for the existence of magnetic clusters of approximately
20 \AA in the strongly correlated alloy system CeNi$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$ (0.7 $\le$
x $\le$ 0.2) based on small angle neutron scattering experiments as well as the
occurrence of staircase-like hysteresis cycles during very low temperature (100
mK) magnetization measurements. An unusual feature is the observation of
long-range ferromagnetic order below the cluster-glass transition without any
indication of a sharp transition at a Curie temperature. These observations
strongly support a phenomenological model where a percolative process connects
the cluster-glass state observed at high temperatures with the long-range
ferromagnetic order observed by neutron diffraction experiments at very low
temperatures. The model can account for all the puzzling macroscopic and
microscopic data previously obtained in this system, providing a new
perspective with regard to the magnetic ground state of other alloyed compounds
with small magnetic moments or weak ferromagnetism with intrinsic disorder
effects.",2007-03-15T08:31:39Z
"Electronic viscosity in a quantum well: A test for the local density
  approximation","In the local density approximation (LDA) for electronic time-dependent
current-density functional theory (TDCDFT) many-body effects are described in
terms of the visco-elastic constants of the homogeneous three-dimensional
electron gas. In this paper we critically examine the applicability of the
three-dimensional LDA to the calculation of the viscous damping of
1-dimensional collective oscillations of angular frequency $\omega$ in a quasi
2-dimensional quantum well. We calculate the effective viscosity
$\zeta(\omega)$ from perturbation theory in the screened Coulomb interaction
and compare it with the commonly used three-dimensional LDA viscosity
$Y(\omega)$. Significant differences are found. At low frequency $Y(\omega)$ is
dominated by a shear term, which is absent in $\zeta(\omega)$. At high
frequency $\zeta(\omega)$ and $Y(\omega)$ exhibit different power law behaviors
($\omega^{-3}$ and $\omega^{-5/2}$ respectively), reflecting different spectral
densities of electron-hole excitations in two and three dimensions. These
findings demonstrate the need for better approximations for the
exchange-correlation stress tensor in specific systems where the use of the
three-dimensional functionals may lead to unphysical results.",2007-02-23T03:38:37Z
Black hole and holographic dark energy,"We discuss the connection between black hole and holographic dark energy. We
examine the issue of the equation of state (EOS) for holographic energy density
as a candidate for the dark energy carefully. This is closely related to the
EOS for black hole, because the holographic dark energy comes from the black
hole energy density. In order to derive the EOS of a black hole, we may use its
dual (quantum) systems. Finally, a regular black hole without the singularity
is introduced to describe an accelerating universe inside the cosmological
horizon. Inspired by this, we show that the holographic energy density with the
cosmological horizon as the IR cutoff leads to the dark energy-dominated
universe with $\omega_{\rm \Lambda}=-1$.",2007-02-06T02:27:19Z
Fluctuation theorems: Work is not an observable,"The characteristic function of the work performed by an external

similar expression is obtained for the averaged exponential work which is
related to the free energy difference of equilibrium systems by the Jarzynski
work theorem.",2007-03-07T17:12:25Z
"Dynamic instability transitions in 1D driven diffusive flow with
  nonlocal hopping","One-dimensional directed driven stochastic flow with competing nonlocal and
local hopping events has an instability threshold from a populated phase into
an empty-road (ER) phase. We implement this in the context of the asymmetric
exclusion process. The nonlocal skids promote strong clustering in the
stationary populated phase. Such clusters drive the dynamic phase transition
and determine its scaling properties. We numerically establish that the
instability transition into the ER phase is second order in the regime where
the entry point reservoir controls the current and first order in the regime
where the bulk is in control. The first order transition originates from a
turn-about of the cluster drift velocity. At the critical line, the current
remains analytic, the road density vanishes linearly, and fluctuations scale as
uncorrelated noise. A self-consistent cluster dynamics analysis explains why
these scaling properties remain that simple.",2007-03-23T08:29:19Z
Non-Planck equilibrium radiation in plasma model of early Universe,"Consideration of the adiabatic character of radiation expansion in early
Universe leads to the conclusion that equilibrium distribution of the
primordial radiation in the presence of charged particles could be different
from the Planck distribution in some regions of the spectrum. The equilibrium
distribution of electromagnetic radiation (the black body radiation) is
generalized for the system containing an extremely dense fully ionized plasma.
The conditions of the adiabatic expansion of radiation for the model of the
early Universe are found.",2007-03-22T09:07:54Z
Exact Markovian kinetic equation for a quantum Brownian oscillator,"We derive an exact Markovian kinetic equation for an oscillator linearly
coupled to a heat bath, describing quantum Brownian motion. Our work is based
on the subdynamics formulation developed by Prigogine and collaborators. The
space of distribution functions is decomposed into independent subspaces that
remain invariant under Liouville dynamics. For integrable systems in
Poincar\'e's sense the invariant subspaces follow the dynamics of uncoupled,
renormalized particles. In contrast for non-integrable systems, the invariant
subspaces follow a dynamics with broken-time symmetry, involving generalized
functions. This result indicates that irreversibility and stochasticity are
exact properties of dynamics in generalized function spaces. We comment on the
relation between our Markovian kinetic equation and the Hu-Paz-Zhang equation.",2007-02-22T06:01:35Z
Analytic approach to the ground-state energy of charged anyon gases,"We derive an approximate analytic formula for the ground-state energy of the
charged anyon gas. Our approach is based on the harmonically confined
two-dimensional (2D) Coulomb anyon gas and a regularization procedure for
vanishing confinement. To take into account the fractional statistics and
Coulomb interaction we introduce a function, which depends on both the
statistics and density parameters (nu and r_s, respectively). We determine this
function by fitting to the ground state energies of the classical electron
crystal at very large r_s (the 2D Wigner crystal), and to the Hartree-Fock (HF)
energy of the spin-polarized 2D electron gas, and the dense 2D Coulomb Bose gas
at very small r_s. The latter is calculated by use of the Bogoliubov
approximation. Applied to the boson system (nu=0) our results are very close to
recent results from Monte Carlo (MC) calculations. For spin-polarized electron
systems (nu=1) our comparison leads to a critical judgment concerning the
density range, to which the HF approximation and MC simulations apply. In
dependence on nu, our analytic formula yields ground-state energies, which
monotonously increase from the bosonic to the fermionic side if r_s > 1. For
r_s leq 1 it shows a nonmonotonous behavior indicating a breakdown of the
assumed continuous transformation of bosons into fermions by variation of the
parameter nu .",2007-01-10T18:48:33Z
"Three-particle collisions in quantum wires: Corrections to thermopower
  and conductance","We consider the effect of electron-electron interaction on the electron
transport through a finite length single-mode quantum wire with reflectionless
contacts. The two-particle scattering events cannot alter the electric current
and therefore we study the effect of three-particle collisions. Within the
Boltzmann equation framework, we calculate corrections to the thermopower and
conductance to the leading order in the interaction and in the length of wire
$L$. We check explicitly that the three-particle collision rate is identically
zero in the case of several integrable interaction potentials. In the general
(non-integrable) case, we find a positive contribution to the thermopower to
leading order in $L$. The processes giving rise to the correction involve
electron states deep in the Fermi sea. Therefore the correction follows an
activation law with the characteristic energy of the order of the Fermi energy
for the electrons in the wire.",2007-03-01T22:17:58Z
"Two energy scales in the spin excitations of the high-T_c superconductor
  La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$","The excitations responsible for producing high-temperature superconductivity
in the cuprates have not been identified. Two promising candidates are
collective spin excitations and phonons. A recent argument against spin
excitations has been their inability to explain structures seen in electronic
spectroscopies such as photoemission and tunnelling. Here we use inelastic
neutron scattering to demonstrate that collective spin excitations in optimally
doped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ are more structured than previously thought.
The excitations have a two component structure with a low-frequency component
strongest around 18 meV and a broader component strongest near 40-70 meV. The
second component carries most of the spectral weight and its energy matches
structure seen in photoemission and tunnelling spectra in the range 50-90 meV.
Our results demonstrate that collective spin excitations can explain features
of quasiparticle spectroscopies and are therefore likely to be the strongest
coupled excitations.",2007-01-08T18:16:25Z
"Veselago Lens for Electrons: Focusing and Caustics in Graphene p-n

graphene is predicted. We show that precise focusing can be achieved by
fine-tuning the densities of carriers on the n- and p-sides of the junction to
equal values, whereas the current distribution in junctions with different
densities resembles caustics in optics. This finding can be utilized in the
engineering of electronic lenses and focused beam-splitters using

Noise Correlations in a Coulomb Blockaded Quantum Dot,"We report measurements of current noise auto- and cross-correlation in a
tunable quantum dot with two or three leads. As the Coulomb blockade is lifted
at finite source-drain bias, the auto-correlation evolves from super-Poissonian
to sub-Poissonian in the two-lead case, and the cross-correlation evolves from
positive to negative in the three-lead case, consistent with transport through
multiple levels. Cross-correlations in the three-lead dot are found to be
proportional to the noise in excess of the Poissonian value in the limit of
weak output tunneling.",2007-03-15T17:21:49Z
Energy diffusion in hard-point systems,"We investigate the diffusive properties of energy fluctuations in a
one-dimensional diatomic chain of hard-point particles interacting through a
square--well potential. The evolution of initially localized infinitesimal and
finite perturbations is numerically investigated for different density values.
All cases belong to the same universality class which can be also interpreted
as a Levy walk of the energy with scaling exponent 3/5. The zero-pressure limit
is nevertheless exceptional in that normal diffusion is found in tangent space
and yet anomalous diffusion with a different rate for perturbations of finite
amplitude. The different behaviour of the two classes of perturbations is
traced back to the ""stable chaos"" type of dynamics exhibited by this model.
Finally, the effect of an additional internal degree of freedom is
investigated, finding that it does not modify the overall scenario",2007-02-08T14:11:26Z

calculated by numerical diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes operator.
We find that, at zero temperature and for constant director $\bf l$, the mass

"On the Maximal Diversity Order of Spatial Multiplexing with Transmit
  Antenna Selection","Zhang et. al. recently derived upper and lower bounds on the achievable
diversity of an N_R x N_T i.i.d. Rayleigh fading multiple antenna system using
transmit antenna selection, spatial multiplexing and a linear receiver
structure. For the case of L = 2 transmitting (out of N_T available) antennas
the bounds are tight and therefore specify the maximal diversity order. For the
general case with L <= min(N_R,N_T) transmitting antennas it was conjectured
that the maximal diversity is (N_T-L+1)(N_R-L+1) which coincides with the lower
bound. Herein, we prove this conjecture for the zero forcing and zero forcing

Phonon-induced electron relaxation in quantum rings,"We study electron-acoustic phonon scattering and electron relaxation in
quantum rings in the absence and in the presence of external magnetic fields.
Electron-phonon interaction is accounted for both the deformation potential and
piezoelectric coupling. At zero magnetic field and small ring radius, the
deformation potential phonon scattering is orders of magnitude larger than the
piezoelectric one. However, the piezoelectric coupling is found to become
important when the ring radius and magnetic field increase. It can be the
dominant scattering mechanism at large ring radii and/or large magnetic fields.
In comparison with the quantum dot case, the acoustic phonon scattering is
stronger in quantum rings.",2007-03-05T20:18:39Z

A giant outburst two years before the core-collapse of a massive star,"The death of massive stars produces a variety of supernovae, which are linked
to the structure of the exploding stars. The detection of several precursor
stars of Type II supernovae have been reported, however we do not yet have
direct information on the progenitors of the hydrogen deficient Type Ib and Ic
supernovae. Here we report that the peculiar Type Ib supernova SN2006jc is
spatially coincident with a bright optical transient that occurred in 2004.
Spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the supernova leads us to suggest
that the progenitor was a carbon-oxygen Wolf-Rayet star embedded within a
helium-rich circumstellar medium. There are different possible explanations for
this pre-explosion transient. It appears similar to the giant outbursts of
Luminous Blue Variables (LBV) of 60-100 solar mass stars, however the
progenitor of SN2006jc was helium and hydrogen deficient. An LBV-like outburst
of a Wolf-Rayet star could be invoked, but this would be the first
observational evidence of such a phenomenon. Alternatively a massive binary
system composed of an LBV which erupted in 2004, and a Wolf-Rayet star
exploding as SN2006jc, could explain the observations.",2007-03-27T14:42:12Z
Enhancement of ferromagnetism upon thermal annealing in pure ZnO,"We report here enhancement of ferromagnetism in pure ZnO upon thermal
annealing with the ferromagnetic transition temperature Tc above room
temperature. We observe a finite coercive field upto 300K and a finite
thermoremanent magnetization upto 340K for the annealed sample. We propose that
magnetic moments can form at anionic vacancy clusters. Ferromagnetism can occur
due to either superexchange between vacancy clusters via isolated F+ centers,
or through a limited electron delocalization between vacancy clusters. Isolated
vacancy clusters or isolated F+ centers give rise to a strong paramagnetic like
behaviour below 10K.",2007-02-21T11:29:31Z
Fingerprinting Logic Programs,"In this work we present work in progress on functionality duplication
detection in logic programs. Eliminating duplicated functionality recently
became prominent in context of refactoring. We describe a quantitative approach
that allows to measure the ``similarity'' between two predicate definitions.
Moreover, we show how to compute a so-called ``fingerprint'' for every
predicate. Fingerprints capture those characteristics of the predicate that are
significant when searching for duplicated functionality. Since reasoning on
fingerprints is much easier than reasoning on predicate definitions, comparing
the fingerprints is a promising direction in automated code duplication in
logic programs.",2007-01-12T15:39:29Z
Optimal finite-time processes in stochastic thermodynamics,"For a small system like a colloidal particle or a single biomolecule embedded

the mean work required to drive the system from one given equilibrium state to
another in a finite time. In general, this optimal protocol obeys an
integro-differential equation. Explicite solutions both for a moving laser trap

protocol to be typical both at the beginning and the end of the process.",2007-01-23T14:15:21Z
"Hybrid path integral Monte Carlo simulation of rigid diatomic molecules:
  effect of quantized rotations on the selectivity of hydrogen isotopes in

Carlo simulations involving rigid linear rotors. We show how to calculate the
quantum torques needed in the simulation from the rotational density matrix,
for which we develop an approximate expression suitable in the case of
heteronuclear molecules.
  We use this method to study the effect of rotational quantization on the
quantum sieving properties of carbon nanotubes, with particular emphasis to the
para-T2/para-H2 selectivity at 20 K. We show how to treat classically only some
of the degrees of freedom of the hydrogen molecule and we find that in the
limit of zero pressure the quantized nature of the rotational degrees of
freedom greatly influence the selectivity, especially in the case of the (3,6)
nanotube, which is the narrowest tube that we have studied.
  We also use path integral Monte Carlo simulations to calculate adsorption
isotherms of different hydrogen isotopes in the interior of carbon nanotubes
and the corresponding selectivity at finite pressures. It is found that the
selectivity increases with respect to the zero pressure value and tends to a
constant value at saturation. We use a simplified effective harmonic oscillator
model to discuss the origin of this behavior.",2007-03-12T09:45:56Z

magnetic fields confirm the existence of a second phase transition, in addition
to the usual first order vortex lattice melting line $H_{m}(T)$. The transition
has a strong first order character, is accompanied by strong hysteresis, and
intersects the melting line in a tricritical point ($H_{m}^{\perp}$,
$H^{\parallel}_{cr}$). Its field dependence and the changing character of the
melting line at the tricritical point strongly suggest that the ground state

HCN Observations of Dense Star-Forming Gas in High Redshift Galaxies,"We present here the sensitive HCN(1-0) observations made with the VLA of two
submillimeter galaxies and two QSOs at high-redshift. HCN emission is the
signature of dense molecular gas found in GMC cores, the actual sites of
massive star formation. We have made the first detection of HCN in a
submillimeter galaxy, SMM J16359+6612. The HCN emission is seen with a signal
to noise ratio of 4$\sigma$ and appears to be resolved as a double-source of
$\approxlt 2''$ separation. Our new HCN observations, combined with previous
HCN detections and upper limits, show that the FIR/HCN ratios in these high
redshift sources lie systematically above the FIR/HCN correlation established
for nearby galaxies by about a factor of 2. Even considering the scatter in the
data and the presence of upper limits, this is an indication that the FIR/HCN
ratios for the early Universe molecular emission line galaxies (EMGs) deviate
from the correlation that fits Galactic giant molecular cloud cores, normal
spirals, LIRGs, and ULIRGs. This indicates that the star formation rate per
solar mass of dense molecular gas is higher in the high-$z$ objects than in
local galaxies including normal spirals LIRGs and ULIRGs. The limited HCN
detections at high-redshift show that the HCN/CO ratios for the high-$z$
objects are high and are comparable to those of the local ULIRGs rather than
those of normal spirals. This indicates that EMGs have a high fraction of dense
molecular gas compared to total molecular gas traced by CO emission.",2007-03-21T07:12:35Z
"Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Folding and Diffusion of Proteins in
  Nanopores","A novel combination of discontinuous molecular dynamics and the Langevin
equation, together with an intermediate-resolution model, are used to carry out
long (several $\mu$s) simulation and study folding transition and transport of
proteins in slit nanopores. Both attractive ($U^+$) and repulsive ($U^-$)
interaction potentials between the proteins and the pore walls are considered.
Near the folding temperature $T_f$ and in the presence of $U^+$ the proteins
undergo a repeating sequence of folding/partially-folding/ unfolding
transitions, while $T_f$ decreases with decreasing pore sizes. The opposite is
true when $U^-$ is present. The proteins' effective diffusivity $D$ is computed
as a function of their length (number of the amino acid groups), temperature
$T$, the pore size, and the interaction potentials $U^\pm$. Far from $T_f$, $D$
increases (roughly) linearly with $T$, but due to the thermal fluctuations and
their effect on the proteins' structure near $T_f$, the dependence of $D$ on
$T$ in this region is nonlinear. Under certain conditions, transport of
proteins in smaller pores can be {\it faster} than that in larger pores.",2007-03-14T21:47:48Z
D-wave correlated Critical Bose Liquids in two dimensions,"We develop a description of a new quantum liquid phase of interacting bosons
in 2d which possesses relative D-wave two-body correlations and which we call a
D-wave Bose Liquid (DBL). The DBL has no broken symmetries, supports gapless
boson excitations residing on ""Bose surfaces"" in momentum space, and exhibits
power law correlations with continuously variable exponents. While the DBL can
be constructed for bosons in the 2d continuum, the state only respects the
point group symmetries of the square lattice. On the lattice the DBL respects
all symmetries and does not require a particular filling. But lattice effects
allow a second distinct phase, a quasi-local variant which we call a D-wave
Local Bose Liquid (DLBL). Remarkably, the DLBL has short-range boson
correlations and hence no Bose surfaces, despite sharing gapless excitations
and other critical signatures with the DBL. Moreover, both phases are metals
with a resistance that vanishes as a power of the temperature. We establish
these results by constructing a class of many-particle wavefunctions for the
DBL, which are time reversal invariant analogs of Laughlin's quantum Hall
wavefunction for bosons at $\nu=1/2$. A gauge theory formulation leads to a
simple mean field theory, and an N-flavor generalization enables incorporation
of gauge field fluctuations to deduce the properties of the DBL/DLBL; various
equal time correlation functions are in qualitative accord with the properties
inferred from the wavefunctions. We also identify a promising Hamiltonian which
might manifest the DBL or DLBL, and perform a variational study comparing to
other competing phases. We suggest how the DBL wavefunction can be generalized
to describe an itinerant non-Fermi liquid phase of electrons on the square
lattice with a no double occupancy constraint, a D-wave metal phase.",2007-03-12T17:10:20Z
Nonlinear Energy Response of Glass Forming Materials,"A theory for the nonlinear energy response of a system subjected to a heat
bath is developed when the temperature of the heat bath is modulated
sinusoidally. The theory is applied to a model glass forming system, where the
landscape is assumed to have 20 basins and transition rates between basins obey
a power law distribution. It is shown that the statistics of eigenvalues of the
transition rate matrix, the glass transition temperature $T_g$, the
Vogel-Fulcher temperature $T_0$ and the crossover temperature $T_x$ can be
determined from the 1st- and 2nd-order ac specific heats, which are defined as
coefficients of the 1st- and 2nd-order energy responses. The imaginary part of
the 1st-order ac specific heat has a broad peak corresponding to the
distribution of the eigenvalues. When the temperature is decreased below $T_g$,
the frequency of the peak decreases and the width increases. Furthermore, the
statistics of eigenvalues can be obtained from the frequency dependence of the
1st-order ac specific heat. The 2nd-order ac specific heat shows extrema as a
function of the frequency. The extrema diverge at the Vogel-Fulcher temperature
$T_0$. The temperature dependence of the extrema changes significantly near
$T_g$ and some extrema vanish near $T_x$.",2007-01-27T16:51:52Z

is that the interface acts as a dissipative environment for a qubit. Recently
ways to modify the RSFQ damping to reduce the dissipation have been introduced.
One of the solutions is to damp the Josephson junctions by a
frequency-dependent linear circuit instead of the plain resistor. The approach
has previously been experimentally tested with a simple SFQ comparator. In this
paper we perform experiments with a full RSFQ circuit, and thus conclude that
in terms of stable operation the approach is applicable for scalable RSFQ
circuits. Realisation and optimisation issues are also discussed.",2007-02-05T16:13:05Z
"Multi-frequency Study of the LMC Supernova Remnant (SNR) B0513-692 and
  New SNR Candidate J051327-6911","We present a new multi-wavelength study of supernova remnant (SNR) B0513-692
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The remnant also has a strong, superposed,
essentially unresolved, but unrelated radio source at its north-western edge,
J051324-691049. This is identified as a likely compact HII region based on
related optical imaging and spectroscopy. We use the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) at 4790 and 8640 MHz to determine the large scale
morphology, spectral index and polarization characteristics of B0513-692 for
the first time. We detect a strongly polarized region (49%) in the remnant's
southern edge. Interestingly we also detect a small (~40 arcsec) moderately
bright, but distinct optical, circular shell in our Halpha imagery which is
adjacent to the compact HII region and just within the borders of the NE edge
of B0513-692. We suggest this is a separate new SNR candidate based on its
apparently distinct character in terms of optical morphology in 3 imaged
emission lines and indicative SNR optical spectroscopy (including enhanced
optical [SII] emission relative to Halpha).",2007-03-28T15:33:58Z
"Average energy and fluctuations of a granular gas in the threshold of
  the clustering instability","The behavior of an isolated dilute granular gas near the threshold of its
clustering instability is investigated by means of fluctuating hydrodynamics
and the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The theoretical predictions from
the former are shown to be in good agreement with the simulation results. The
total energy of the the system is renormalized by the fluctuations of the
vorticity field. Moreover, the scaled second moment of the energy fluctuations
exhibits a power-law divergent behavior",2007-01-11T16:14:36Z
"Strongly renormalized quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in a
  heterostructure with correlation effects","We present aspects of strong electron correlation in a model of a BI/M/BI
heterostructure where BI is a band insulator and M can be tuned from a metal to
a Mott insulator by varying the on-site repulsion. An effective one-dimensional
Schroedinger equation for the low-energy part is derived in the framework of
the Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson mean-field theory and solved
self-consistently for a wide range of the on-site interaction strength and of
the width of the sandwiched material M. In the strongly interacting limit
coherent quasiparticles responsible for metallic behavior are confined to a
relatively narrow region near the interfaces where they form a
quasi-two-dimensional electron gas. Due to the lack of spatial homogeneity
these quasiparticles intrinsically obtain a nontrivial dependence on the
transverse momentum which for example enters the low-energy behavior of the
optical conductivity.",2007-01-26T15:38:01Z
"Orbital evolution for extreme mass-ratio binaries: conservative self
  forces","The conservative dephasing effects of gravitational self forces for extreme
mass-ratio inspirals are studied. Both secular and non-secular conservative
effects may have a significant effect on LISA waveforms that is independent of
the mass ratio of the system. Such effects need to be included in generated
waveforms to allow for accurate gravitational wave astronomy that requires
integration times as long as a year.",2007-01-02T20:04:04Z
FLY: MPI-2 High Resolution code for LSS Cosmological Simulations,"Cosmological simulations of structures and galaxies formations have played a
fundamental role in the study of the origin, formation and evolution of the
Universe. These studies improved enormously with the use of supercomputers and
parallel systems and, recently, grid based systems and Linux clusters. Now we
present the new version of the tree N-body parallel code FLY that runs on a PC
Linux Cluster using the one side communication paradigm MPI-2 and we show the
performances obtained. FLY is included in the Computer Physics Communication
Program Library. This new version was developed using the Linux Cluster of
CINECA, an IBM Cluster with 1024 Intel Xeon Pentium IV 3.0 Ghz. The results
show that it is possible to run a 64 Million particle simulation in less than
15 minutes for each timestep, and the code scalability with the number of
processors is achieved. This lead us to propose FLY as a code to run very large
N-Body simulations with more than $10^{9}$ particles with the higher resolution
of a pure tree code. The FLY new version will be available at
http://www.ct.astro.it/fly/ and CPC Program Library.",2007-03-20T15:12:21Z
Density functional calculations of nanoscale conductance,"Density functional calculations for the electronic conductance of single
molecules are now common. We examine the methodology from a rigorous point of
view, discussing where it can be expected to work, and where it should fail.
When molecules are weakly coupled to leads, local and gradient-corrected
approximations fail, as the Kohn-Sham levels are misaligned. In the weak bias
regime, XC corrections to the current are missed by the standard methodology.
For finite bias, a new methodology for performing calculations can be
rigorously derived using an extension of time-dependent current density
functional theory from the Schroedinger equation to a Master equation.",2007-03-22T20:18:33Z
"Colossal electroresistance in ferromagnetic insulating state of single
  crystal Nd$_0.7$Pb$_0.3$MnO$_3$","Colossal electroresistance (CER) has been observed in the ferromagnetic
insulating (FMI) state of a manganite. Notably, the CER in the FMI state occurs
in the absence of magnetoresistance (MR). Measurements of electroresistance
(ER) and current induced resistivity switching have been performed in the
ferromagnetic insulating state of a single crystal manganite of composition
Nd$_0.7$Pb$_0.3$MnO$_3$ (NPMO30). The sample has a paramagnetic to
ferromagnetic (Curie) transition temperature, Tc = 150 K and the ferromagnetic
insulating state is realized for temperatures, T <~ 130 K. The colossal
electroresistance, arising from a strongly nonlinear dependence of resistivity
($\rho$) on current density (j), attains a large value ($\approx 100%$) in the
ferromagnetic insulating state. The severity of this nonlinear behavior of
resistivity at high current densities is progressively enhanced with decreasing
temperature, resulting ultimately, in a regime of negative differential
resistivity (NDR, d$\rho$/dj < 0) for temperatures <~ 25 K. Concomitant with
the build-up of the ER however, is a collapse of the MR to a small value (<
20%) even in magnetic field, H = 7 T. This demonstrates that the mechanisms
that give rise to ER and MR are effectively decoupled in the ferromagnetic
insulating phase of manganites. We establish that, the behavior of
ferromagnetic insulating phase is distinct from the ferromagnetic metallic
(FMM) phase as well as the charge ordered insulating (COI) phase, which are the
two commonly realized ground state phases of manganites.",2007-01-05T05:19:17Z
Gas-Mediated Impact Dynamics in Fine-Grained Granular Materials,"Non-cohesive granular media exhibit complex responses to sudden impact that
often differ from those of ordinary solids and liquids. We investigate how this
response is mediated by the presence of interstitial gas between the grains.
Using high-speed x-ray radiography we track the motion of a steel sphere
through the interior of a bed of fine, loose granular material. We find a
crossover from nearly incompressible, fluid-like behavior at atmospheric
pressure to a highly compressible, dissipative response once most of the gas is
evacuated. We discuss these results in light of recent proposals for the drag
force in granular media.",2007-02-14T16:22:52Z
Understanding the Branly effect,"At the end of the nineteenth century \'{E}douard Branly discovered that the
electrical resistance of a granular metallic conductor could drop by several
orders of magnitude when excited by the electromagnetic field emitted by an
electrical spark. Despite the fact that this effect has been used to detect
radio waves in the early times of wireless telegraphy and more recently studied
in the field of granular materials, no satisfactory explanation of the physical
origin of the effect has been given yet. In this contribution we propose to
relate the Branly effect to the induced tunnelling effect first described by
Fran\c{c}ois Bardou and Dominique Boos\'{e}.",2007-03-19T18:27:46Z
Stress transmission in wet granular materials,"We analyze stress transmission in wet granular media in the pendular state by
means of three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the
tensile action of capillary bonds induces a self-stressed particle network
organized in two percolating ""phases"" of positive and negative particle
pressures. Various statistical descriptors of the microstructure and bond force
network are used to characterize this partition. Two basic properties emerge:
1) The highest particle pressure is located in the bulk of each phase; 2) The
lowest pressure level occurs at the interface between the two phases, involving
also the largest connectivity of the particles via tensile and compressive
bonds. When a confining pressure is applied, the number of tensile bonds falls
off and the negative phase breaks into aggregates and isolated sites.",2007-01-10T19:55:38Z
Dissipation Under the Magnetic Field on 2D Surface,"It is well known that the convection of liquid solution or melt liquid is
inhibited by the magnetic field experimentally, and so that we can make the
larger and better crystals at the cost of slow growth rate. We shall show here
another two effects due to the magnetic field. First, when the ionised molecule
diffuses on the surface of crystal under the magnetic field applied normal to
the surface,its diffusion constant decreases due to the magnetic effect.
Second, even if the molecule has no electric charge, if it has electric dipole
moment, the kinetic energy decreases by different mechanism.",2007-03-28T06:52:30Z

Comparison of Supernovae datasets Constraints on Dark Energy,"Cosmological measurements suggest that our universe contains a dark energy
component. In order to study the dark energy evolution, we constrain a
parameterized dark energy equation of state $w(z)=w_0 + w_1 \frac{z}{1+z}$
using the recent observational datasets: 157 Gold type Ia supernovae and the
newly released 182 Gold type Ia supernovae by maximum likelihood method. It is
found that the best fit $w(z)$ crosses -1 in the past and the present best fit
value of $w(0)<-1$ obtained from 157 Gold type Ia supernovae. The crossing of
-1 is not realized and $w_0=-1$ is not ruled out in $1\sigma$ confidence level
for the 182 Gold type Ia supernovae. We also find that the range of parameter
$w_0$ is wide even in $1\sigma$ confidence level and the best fit $w(z)$ is
sensitive to the prior of $\Omega_m$.",2007-03-20T04:36:52Z
"On the feasibility of studying vortex noise in 2D superconductors with
  cold atoms","We investigate the feasibility of using ultracold neutral atoms trapped near
a thin superconductor to study vortex noise close to the
Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii transition temperature. Alkali atoms such as
rubidium probe the magnetic field produced by the vortices. We show that the
relaxation time $T_1$ of the Zeeman sublevel populations can be conveniently
adjusted to provide long observation times. We also show that the transverse
relaxation times $T_2$ for Zeeman coherences are ideal for studying the vortex
noise. We briefly consider the motion of atom clouds held close to the surface
as a method for monitoring the vortex motion.",2007-02-26T18:01:53Z
Universal Extremal Statistics in a Freely Expanding Jepsen Gas,"We study the extremal dynamics emerging in an out-of-equilibrium
one-dimensional Jepsen gas of $(N+1)$ hard-point particles. The particles
undergo binary elastic collisions, but move ballistically in-between
collisions. The gas is initally uniformly distributed in a box $[-L,0]$ with
the ""leader"" (or the rightmost particle) at X=0, and a random positive
velocity, independently drawn from a distribution $\phi(V)$, is assigned to
each particle. The gas expands freely at subsequent times. We compute
analytically the distribution of the leader's velocity at time $t$, and also
the mean and the variance of the number of collisions that are undergone by the
leader up to time $t$. We show that in the thermodynamic limit and at fixed
time $t\gg 1$ (the so-called ""growing regime""), when interactions are strongly
manifest, the velocity distribution exhibits universal scaling behavior of only
three possible varieties, depending on the tail of $\phi(V)$. The associated
scaling functions are novel and different from the usual extreme-value
distributions of uncorrelated random variables. In this growing regime the mean
and the variance of the number of collisions of the leader up to time $t$
increase logarithmically with $t$, with universal prefactors that are computed
exactly. The implications of our results in the context of biological evolution
modeling are pointed out.",2007-01-07T13:10:31Z
"Subgap tunneling via quantum-interference effect: insulators and charge
  density waves","A quantum interference effect is discussed for subgap tunneling over a
distance comparable to the coherence length, which is a consequence of
``advanced-advanced'' and ``retarded-retarded'' transmission modes [Altland and
Zirnbauer, Phys. Rev. B 55, 1142 (1997)]. Effects typical of disorder are
obtained from the interplay between multichannel averaging and higher order
processes in the tunnel amplitudes. Quantum interference effects similar to
those occurring in normal tunnel junctions explain magnetoresistance
oscillations of a CDW pierced by nanoholes [Latyshev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
78, 919 (1997)], having periodicity h/2e as a function of the flux enclosed in
the nanohole. Subgap tunneling is coupled to the sliding motion by charge
accumulation in the interrupted chains. The effect is within the same trend as
random matrix theory for normal metal-CDW hybrids [Visscher et al., Phys. Rev.
B 62, 6873 (2000)]. We suggest that the experiment by Latyshev et al. probes
weak localization-like properties of evanescent quasiparticles, not an
interference effect related to the quantum mechanical ground state.",2007-01-30T12:51:54Z
"Core-Level Photoelectron Spectroscopy Probing Local Strain at Silicon
  Surfaces and Interfaces","Using a first-principles approach, we investigate the origin of the fine
structure in Si 2$p$ photoelectron spectra at the Si(100)2$\times$1 surface and
at the Si(100)-SiO$_2$ interface. Calculated and measured shifts show very good
agreement for both systems. By using maximally localized Wannier functions, we
provide an interpretation in which the effects due to the electronegativity of
second nearest neighbor atoms and due to the local strain field are
distinguished. Hence, in combination with accurate modeling, photoelectron
spectroscopy can provide a direct measure of the strain field at the atomic
scale.",2007-03-15T19:26:11Z
"Simulations on the elastic response of amorphous and nanocomposite
  carbon","Theoretical calculations of the elastic response of carbon composites and
amorphous carbon are reported. The studied composites consist of crystalline
nanoinclusions, either spherical diamonds or carbon nanotubes, embedded in
amorphous carbon matrices. The elastic constants of the composites were
calculated and found to systematically increase as the density increases. The
elastic recovery under hydrostatic pressure for all structures was also
investigated and was found to be significantly high for both nanocomposite and
amorphous carbon, but decreases as the material becomes more dilute.",2007-03-02T23:36:21Z
"Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in two-dimensional lattice
  gas models","We have considered two classical lattice-gas models, consisting of particles
that carry multicomponent magnetic momenta, and associated with a
two-dimensional square lattices; each site can host one particle at most, thus
implicitly allowing for hard-core repulsion; the pair interaction, restricted
to nearest neighbors, is ferromagnetic and involves only two components. The
case of zero chemical potential has been investigated by Grand--Canonical Monte
Carlo simulations; the fluctuating occupation numbers now give rise to
additional fluid-like observables in comparison with the usual
saturated--lattice situation; these were investigated and their possible
influence on the critical behaviour was discussed. Our results show that the
present model supports a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition with
a transition temperature lower than that of the saturated lattice counterpart
due to the presence of ``vacancies''; comparisons were also made with similar
models studied in the literature.",2007-01-24T10:20:17Z
Non-local effective medium of metamaterial,"In this paper, we investigate the effect of spatial dispersion on a
double-lattice metamaterial which has both magnetic and electric response. A
numerical scheme based on a dipolar model is developed to extract the non-local
effective medium of the metamaterial. We found a structure-induced bianisotropy
near the resonance gap even if the artificial particles are free from
cross-coupling. A cross-coupled resonance also results from spatial dispersion
and it can be understood using a Lorentz frequency dispersion model. The
strength of the cross-coupled resonance depends on the microstructure and it is
larger at a higher normalized frequency.",2007-01-15T14:44:29Z
Sampling Eulerian orientations of triangular lattice graphs,"We consider the problem of sampling from the uniform distribution on the set
of Eulerian orientations of subgraphs of the triangular lattice. Although it is
known that this can be achieved in polynomial time for any graph, the algorithm
studied here is more natural in the context of planar Eulerian graphs. We
analyse the mixing time of a Markov chain on the Eulerian orientations of a
planar graph which moves between orientations by reversing the edges of
directed faces. Using path coupling and the comparison method we obtain a
polynomial upper bound on the mixing time of this chain for any solid subgraph
of the triangular lattice. By considering the conductance of the chain we show
that there exist subgraphs with holes for which the chain will always take an
exponential amount of time to converge. Finally, as an additional justification
for studying a Markov chain on the set of Eulerian orientations of planar
graphs, we show that the problem of counting Eulerian orientations remains
#P-complete when restricted to planar graphs.
  A preliminary version of this work appeared as an extended abstract in the
2nd Algorithms and Complexity in Durham workshop.",2007-03-07T12:34:03Z
"Vorticity structuring and Taylor-like velocity rolls triggered by
  gradient shear bands","We suggest a novel mechanism by which vorticity structuring and Taylor-like
velocity rolls can form in complex fluids, triggered by the linear instability
of one dimensional gradient shear banded flow. We support this with a numerical
study of the diffusive Johnson-Segalman model. In the steady vorticity
structured state, the thickness of the interface between the bands remains
finite in the limit of zero stress diffusivity, presenting a possible challenge
to the accepted theory of shear banding.",2007-03-06T13:15:28Z

"Theory of fast optical spin rotation in a quantum dot based on geometric
  phases and trapped states","A method is proposed for the optical rotation of the spin of an electron in a
quantum dot using excited trion states to implement operations up to two orders
of magnitude faster than those of most existing proposals. Key ingredients are
the geometric phase induced by 2$\pi$ hyperbolic secant pulses, use of
coherently trapped states and use of naturally dark states. Our proposal covers
a wide variety of quantum dots by addressing different parameter regimes. In
one case the treatment provides an exact solution to the three-level system.
Numerical simulations with typical parameters for InAs self-assembled quantum
dots, including their dissipative dynamics, give fidelities of the operations
in excess of 99%.",2007-03-03T21:04:54Z
Ultrafast demagnetization in the sp-d model: a theoretical study,"We propose and analyze a theoretical model of ultrafast light-induced
magnetization dynamics in systems of localized spins that are coupled to
carriers' spins by sp-d exchange interaction. A prominent example of a class of
materials falling into this category are ferromagnetic (III,Mn)V
semiconductors, in which ultrafast demagnetization has been recently observed.
In the proposed model light excitation heats up the population of carriers,
taking it out of equilibrium with the localized spins. This triggers the
process of energy and angular momentum exchange between the two spin systems,
which lasts for the duration of the energy relaxation of the carriers. We
derive the Master equation for the density matrix of a localized spin
interacting with the hot carriers and couple it with a phenomenological
treatment of the carrier dynamics. We develop a general theory within the sp-d
model and we apply it to the ferromagnetic semiconductors, taking into account
the valence band structure of these materials. We show that the fast spin
relaxation of the carriers can sustain the flow of polarization between the
localized and itinerant spins leading to significant demagnetization of the
localized spin system, observed in (III,Mn)V materials.",2007-03-02T03:06:06Z
"Macroscopic quantum tunneling and quasiparticle-tunneling blockade
  effect in s-wave/d-wave hybrid junctions","We have theoretically investigated macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) and
the influence of nodal quasiparticles and zero energy bound states (ZES) on MQT
in s-wave/ d-wave hybrid Josephson junctions. In contrast to d-wave/d-wave
junctions, the low-energy quasiparticle dissipation resulting from nodal
quasiparticles and ZES is suppressed due to a quasiparticle-tunneling blockade
effect in an isotropic s-wave superconductor. Therefore, the inherent
dissipation in these junctions is found to be very weak. We have also
investigated MQT in a realistic s-wave/d-wave (Nb/Au/YBCO) junction in which
Ohmic dissipation in a shunt resistance is stronger than the inherent
dissipation and find that MQT is observable within the current experimental
technology. This result suggests high potential of s-wave/d-wave hybrid
junctions for applications in quantum information devices.",2007-02-21T01:11:11Z
"Quantum phase transitions and dimensional reduction in antiferromagnets
  with inter-layer frustration","For magnets with a fully frustrated inter-layer interaction, we argue that
the quantum phase transitions from a paramagnetic to an antiferromagnetic
ground state, driven by pressure or magnetic field, are asymptotically
three-dimensional, due to interaction-generated non-frustrated inter-layer
couplings. However, the relevant crossover scale is tiny, such that
two-dimensional behavior occurs in an experimentally relevant low-temperature
regime. In the pressure-driven case the phase transition may split, in which
case an Ising symmetry related to inter-layer bond order is broken before
magnetism occurs. We discuss the relation of our results to recent experiments
on BaCuSi2O6.",2007-02-07T09:53:43Z
The Strange Man in Random Networks of Automata,"We have performed computer simulations of Kauffman's automata on several
graphs such as the regular square lattice and invasion percolation clusters in
order to investigate phase transitions, radial distributions of the mean total
damage (dynamical exponent $z$) and propagation speeds of the damage when one
adds a damaging agent, nicknamed ""strange man"". Despite the increase in the
damaging efficiency, we have not observed any appreciable change at the
transition threshold to chaos neither for the short-range nor for the
small-world case on the square lattices when the strange man is added in
comparison to when small initial damages are inserted in the system. The
propagation speed of the damage cloud until touching the border of the system
in both cases obeys a power law with a critical exponent $\alpha$ that strongly
depends on the lattice. Particularly, we have ckecked the damage spreading when
some connections are removed on the square lattice and when one considers
special invasion percolation clusters (high boundary-saturation clusters). It
is seen that the propagation speed in these systems is quite sensible to the
degree of dilution.",2007-02-07T20:32:42Z
Mesoscopic phase statistics of diffuse ultrasound in dynamic matter,"Temporal fluctuations in the phase of waves transmitted through a dynamic,

Absence of low temperature anomaly on the melting curve of $^4$He,"We have measured the melting pressure and pressure in the liquid at constant
density of ultra-pure $^4$He (0.3 ppb of $^3$He impurities) with the accuracy
of about 0.5 $\mu$bar in the temperature range from 10 to 320 mK. Our
measurements show that the anomaly on the melting curve below 80 mK which we
have recently observed is entirely due to an anomaly in the elastic modulus of
Be-Cu from which our pressure gauge is made of. We thus conclude that the
melting pressure of $^4$He follows the $T^4$ law due to phonons in the whole
temperature range from 10 to 320 mK without any sign of a supersolid
transition.",2007-03-28T06:47:45Z
Surface imaging of inelastic Friedel oscillations,"Impurities that are present on the surface of a metal often have internal
degrees of freedom. Inelastic scattering due to impurities can be revealed by
observing local features seen in the tunneling current with scanning tunneling
microscope (STM). We consider localized vibrational modes coupled to the
electronic structure of a surface. We argue that vibrational modes of
impurities produce Fermi momentum $k_F$ oscillations in second derivative of
current with respect to voltage $\partial^2I(\br, V)/\partial V^2$. These
oscillations are similar to the well known Friedel oscillations of screening
charge on the surface. We propose to measure inelastic scattering generated by
the presence of the vibrational modes with STM by imaging the
$\partial^2I/\partial V^2$ oscillations on the metal surface.",2007-01-24T23:22:12Z
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Quantum Hall Effect in Graphene,"In this article we briefly review recent experimental and theoretical work on
quantum Hall effect in graphene, and argue that some of the quantum Hall states

manner in which symmetry breaking occurs, and detect the collective charge and
neutral excitations associated with symmetry breaking. Other issues will also
be briefly mentioned.",2007-03-28T17:54:07Z
A fully 3-dimensional thermal model of a comet nucleus,"A 3-D numerical model of comet nuclei is presented. An implicit numerical
scheme was developed for the thermal evolution of a spherical nucleus composed
of a mixture of ice and dust. The model was tested against analytical
solutions, simplified numerical solutions, and 1-D thermal evolution codes. The
3-D code was applied to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; surface temperature
maps and the internal thermal structure was obtained as function of depth,
longitude and hour angle. The effect of the spin axis tilt on the surface
temperature distribution was studied in detail. It was found that for small
tilt angles, relatively low temperatures may prevail on near-pole areas,
despite lateral heat conduction. A high-resolution run for a comet model of
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with low tilt angle, allowing for crystallization of
amorphous ice, showed that the amorphous/crystalline ice boundary varies
significantly with depth as a function of cometary latitude.",2007-03-11T16:29:08Z
Excitonic giant Zeeman effect in GaN:Mn^3+,"We describe a direct observation of the excitonic giant Zeeman splitting in
(Ga,Mn)N, a wide-gap III-V diluted magnetic semiconductor. Reflectivity and
absorption spectra measured at low temperatures display the A and B excitons,
with a shift under magnetic field due to s,p-d exchange interactions. Using an
excitonic model, we determine the difference of exchange integrals between
Mn^3+ and free carriers in GaN, N_0(alpha-beta)=-1.2 +/- 0.2 eV. Assuming a
reasonable value of alpha, this implies a positive sign of beta which
corresponds to a rarely observed ferromagnetic interaction between the magnetic
ions and the holes.",2007-03-02T20:12:35Z
"Spin moment over 10-300 K and delocalization of magnetic electrons above
  the Verwey transition in magnetite","In order to probe the magnetic ground state, we have carried out temperature
dependent magnetic Compton scattering experiments on an oriented single crystal
of magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$), together with the corresponding first-principles
band theory computations to gain insight into the measurements. An accurate
value of the magnetic moment $\mu_S$ associated with unpaired spins is obtained
directly over the temperature range of 10-300K. $\mu_S$ is found to be
non-integral and to display an anomalous behavior with the direction of the
external magnetic field near the Verwey transition. These results reveal how
the magnetic properties enter the Verwey energy scale via spin-orbit coupling
and the geometrical frustration of the spinel structure, even though the Curie
temperature of magnetite is in excess of 800 K. The anisotropy of the magnetic
Compton profiles increases through the Verwey temperature $T_v$ and indicates
that magnetic electrons in the ground state of magnetite become delocalized on
Fe B-sites above $T_v$.",2007-03-12T19:45:19Z
"Static dielectric response and Born effective charge of BN nanotubes
  from {\it ab initio} finite electric field calculations","{\it Ab initio} investigations of the full static dielectric response and
Born effective charge of BN nanotubes (BN-NTs) have been performed for the
first time using finite electric field method. It is found that the ionic
contribution to the static dielectric response of BN-NTs is substantial and
also that a pronounced chirality-dependent oscillation is superimposed on the
otherwise linear relation between the longitudinal electric polarizability and
the tube diameter ($D$), as for a thin dielectric cylinderical shell. In
contrast, the transverse dielectric response of the BN-NTs resemble the
behavior of a thin (non-ideal) conducting cylindrical shell of a diameter of
$D+4$\AA$ $, with a screening factor of 2 for the inner electric field. The
medium principal component $Z_y^*$ of the Born effective charge corresponding
to the transverse atomic displacement tangential to the BN-NT surface, has a
pronounced $D$-dependence (but independent of chirality), while the large
longitudinal component $Z_z^*$ exhibits a clear chirality dependence (but
nearly $D$-independent), suggesting a powerful way to characterize the diameter
and chirality of a BN-NT.",2007-02-22T12:11:31Z
Symmetry of Multiferroicity in a Frustrated Magnet TbMn$_2$O$_5$,"Based on measurements of soft x-ray magnetic scattering and symmetry
considerations, we demonstrate that the magnetoelectric effect in TbMn$_2$O$_5$
arises from an internal field determined by $\vec{S}_{\vec{q}} \times
{\vec{S}_{-\vec{q}}}$ with $\vec{S}_{\vec{q}}$ being the magnetization at
modulation vector $\vec{q}$, whereas the magneto-elastic effect in the exchange

"Ground-state properties of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates: Extension
  of the Thomas-Fermi approximation","We derive general approximate formulas that provide with remarkable accuracy
the ground-state properties of any mean-field scalar Bose-Einstein condensate
with short-range repulsive interatomic interactions, confined in arbitrary
cylindrically symmetric harmonic traps. Our formulation is even applicable for
condensates containing a multiply quantized axisymmetric vortex. We have
checked the validity of our formulas by numerically solving the 3D
Gross-Pitaevskii equation.",2007-01-31T02:28:02Z
The Effect of Randomness on the Mott State,"We reinvestigate the competition between the Mott and the Anderson insulator
state in a one-dimensional disordered fermionic system by a combination of
instanton and renormalization group methods. Tracing back both the
compressibility and the ac-conductivity to a vanishing kink energy of the
electronic displacement field we do not find any indication for the existence
of an intermediate (Mott glass) phase.",2007-01-05T17:36:07Z
"Tip artifact in atomic force microscopy observations of InAs quantum
  dots grown in Stranski-Krastanow mode","The tip artifact in atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations of InAs
islands was evaluated quantitatively. The islands were grown in the
Stranski-Krastanow mode of molecular beam epitaxy. The width and height of the
islands were determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and AFM.
The average $[\bar{1}10]$ in-plane width and height determined using TEM
excluding native oxide were 22 and 7 nm, respectively; those determined using
AFM including the oxide were 35 and 8 nm, respectively. The difference in width
was due to the oxide and the tip artifact. The sizes including the oxide were
deduced from TEM observations to be a width of 27 nm and a height of 6 nm with
correction for the thickness of the oxide. The residual difference of 8 nm
between the width determined using AFM and that determined using TEM including
the oxide was ascribed to the tip artifact. The results enable us to determine
the actual size of the islands from their AFM images.",2007-02-15T08:32:53Z
"A Study of Stellar Photometric Variability Within the Central 4 pc of
  the Galactic Center with Infrared Image Subtraction","We present a catalog of 110 variable stars within ~1' of Sgr A* based on
image subtraction of near-infrared (H and K) photometry. Our images were
obtained over 133 nights from 2000--2002 in H-band and over 134 nights from
2001--2002 in K-band; the typical FWHM is 1.4''. We match the catalog to other
near-infrared, X-ray, and radio (i.e., maser) data, and we discuss some of the
more interesting objects. The catalog includes 14 periodic sources, several
known long-period variables and three new LPV candidates. We associate IRS 10*
with OH, SiO, and H2O masers and a bright X-ray point source; this analysis
suggests IRS 10* is an AGB star with an accreting companion. Among the
approximately 90 newly discovered sources are a probable cataclysmic variable,
a potential edge-on contact 84 day period eclipsing binary, and a possible 41
day period pulsating variable.",2007-03-29T20:14:17Z
"Evidence for local lattice distortions in giant magnetocapacitive
  CdCr2S4","Raman scattering experiments on CdCr2S4 single crystals show pronounced
anomalies in intensity and frequency of optical phonon modes with an onset
temperature T*=130 K that coincides with the regime of giant magnetocapacitive
effects. A loss of inversion symmetry and Cr off-centering are deduced from the
observation of longitudinal optical and formerly infrared active modes for
T<T_c=84 K. The intensity anomalies are attributed to the enhanced electronic
polarizability of displacements that modulate the Cr-S distance and respective
hybridization. Photo doping leads to an annihilation of the symmetry reduction.
Our scenario of multiferroic effects is based on the near degeneracy of polar
and nonpolar modes and the additional low energy scale due to hybridization.",2007-02-15T14:17:42Z
Induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Observed in Microwave Billiards,"Using reciprocity, we investigate the breaking of time-reversal (T) symmetry
due to a ferrite embedded in a flat microwave billiard. Transmission spectra of
isolated single resonances are not sensitive to T-violation whereas those of
pairs of nearly degenerate resonances do depend on the direction of time. For
their theoretical description a scattering matrix model from nuclear physics is
used. The T-violating matrix elements of the effective Hamiltonian for the
microwave billiard with the embedded ferrite are determined experimentally as
functions of the magnetization of the ferrite.",2007-02-02T08:43:37Z
"A new mechanism for negative refraction and focusing using selective
  diffraction from surface corrugation","Refraction at a smooth interface is accompanied by momentum transfer normal
to the interface. We show that corrugating an initially smooth, totally
reflecting, non-metallic interface provides a momentum kick parallel to the
surface, which can be used to refract light negatively or positively. This new
mechanism of negative refraction is demonstrated by visible light and microwave
experiments on grisms (grating-prisms). Single-beam
all-angle-negative-refraction is achieved by incorporating a surface grating on
a flat multilayered material. This negative refraction mechanism is used to
create a new optical device, a grating lens. A plano-concave grating lens is
demonstrated to focus plane microwaves to a point image. These results show
that customized surface engineering can be used to achieve negative refraction
even though the bulk material has positive refractive index. The surface
periodicity provides a tunable parameter to control beam propagation leading to
novel optical and microwave devices.",2007-02-12T18:42:50Z
"Anisotropic spin transport in GaAs quantum wells in the presence of
  competing Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit-coupling strengths","Aiming at the optimization of the spin diffusion length in (001) GaAs quantum
wells, we explore the effect of the anisotropy of the spin-orbit coupling on
the competition between the Rashba and the Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings by
solving the kinetic spin Bloch equations with the electron-phonon and the
electron-electron scattering explicitly included. For identical strengths of
the Rashba and the Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings, the spin diffusion length
shows strong anisotropy not only for the spin polarization direction but also
for the spin diffusion direction. Two special directions are used seeking for
the large diffusion length: ($\bar{1}$10) and (110). Without the cubic term of
the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and with the identical Dresselhaus and
Rashba strengths, infinite diffusion lengths can be obtained {\em either} for
the spin diffusion/injection direction along $(\bar110)$, regardless of the
direction of spin polarization, {\em or} for the spin polarization along
$(110)$, regardless of the direction of the spin diffusion/injection.
  However, the cubic Dresselhaus term cannot be neglected, resulting into a
finite spin diffusion length which decreases with the temperature and the
electron density, and of which the anisotropy for the spin diffusion direction
and spin polarization direction is maintained. For the spin diffusion/injection
direction along ($\bar{1}$10), the spin diffusion length increases first with
the increase of the Rashba strength (from 0) which can be tuned by the external
gate voltage; when the Rashba strength is slightly smaller than (in stead of
equal to) the Dresselhaus strength, the diffusion length reaches its maximum;
and then it decreases with the Rashba strength.",2007-01-30T21:38:02Z
Breathing modes of a fast rotating Fermi gas,"We derive the frequency spectrum of the lowest compressional oscillations of
a 3D harmonically trapped Fermi superfluid in the presence of a vortex lattice,
treated in the diffused vorticity approximation within a hydrodynamic approach.
We consider the general case of a superfluid at T=0 characterized by a
polytropic equation of state ($\sim{n}^\gamma$), which includes both the
Bose-Einstein condensed regime of dimers ($\gamma=1$) and the unitary limit of
infinite scattering length ($\gamma=2/3$). Important limiting cases are
considered, including the centrifugal limit, the isotropic trapping and the
cigar geometry. The conditions required to enter the lowest Landau level and
quantum Hall regimes at unitarity are also discussed.",2007-02-13T18:20:22Z
"Superconductivity due to spin fluctuations originating from multiple
  Fermi surfaces in a double chain superconductor
  Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-δ}$}","The mechanism of superconductivity in Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ is
studied using a quasi-one dimensional double chain model with appopriate
hopping integrals, on-site $U$, and off-site repulsion $V_1$. Applying the
fluctuation exchange method to this model and solving the Eliashberg equation,
we obtain the doping dependence of superconductivity that is consistent with
the experiments. The superconducting gap has an extended s-wave-like form,
which gives a temperature dependence of the spin lattice relaxation rate that
does not contradict with the experimental results.",2007-01-09T04:09:27Z
"Double superconducting transition in the filled skutterudite PrOs4Sb12
  and sample characterizations","A thorough characterization of many samples of the filled skutterudite
compound PrOs4Sb12 is provided. We find that the double superconducting
transition in the specific heat Tc1~1.89K and Tc2~1.72K tends to appear in
samples with a large residual resistivity ratio, large specific heat jump at
the superconducting transition and with the highest absolute value of the
specific heat above Tc1. However, we present evidence which casts doubt on the
intrinsic nature of the double superconducting transition. The ratio of the two
specific heat jumps \Delta C(Tc1)/\Delta C(Tc2) shows a wide range of values on
crystals from different batches but also within the same batch. This ratio was
strongly reduced by polishing a sample down to 120um. Remarkably, three samples
exhibit a single sharp transition of ~15mK in width at Tc~1.7K. The normalized
specific heat jump (C-Cnormal)/Cnormal at Tc of two of them is higher than ~32%
so larger than the sum of the two specific heat jumps when a double transition
exists. As an evidence of better quality, the slope in the transition is at
least two time steeper.
  We discuss the origins of the double transition; in particular we consider,
based on X-ray diffraction results, a scenario involving Pr-vacancies. The
superconducting phase diagram under magnetic field of a sample with a single
transition is fitted with a two-band model taking into account the good values
for the gap as deduced from thermal conductivity measurements.",2007-03-27T06:54:09Z
"Dispersive microwave bifurcation of a superconducting resonator cavity
  incorporating a Josephson junction","We have observed the dynamical bistability of a microwave superconducting
Fabry-Perot cavity incorporating a non-linear element in the form of Josephson
tunnel junction. The effect, which is the analog of optical bistability,
manifests itself in the transmission and reflection characteristics of the
cavity and is governed by a competition between the wave amplitude dependence
of the resonant frequency and the finite residence time of the field energy
inside the cavity. This finite residence time is solely due to extraction of
radiation from the cavity by the measurement process. The tight quantitative
agreement with a simple model based on the Duffing oscillator equation shows
that the nonlinearity, and hence the bifurcation phenomenon, is solely
dispersive.",2007-02-19T20:30:50Z
Metastable tight knots in a worm-like polymer,"Based on an estimate of the knot entropy of a worm-like chain we predict that
the interplay of bending energy and confinement entropy will result in a
compact metastable configuration of the knot that will diffuse, without
spreading, along the contour of the semi-flexible polymer until it reaches one
of the chain ends. Our estimate of the size of the knot as a function of its
topological invariant (ideal aspect ratio) agrees with recent experimental
results of knotted dsDNA. Further experimental tests of our ideas are proposed.",2007-02-07T00:00:23Z
On a covariant version of Caianiello's Model,"Caianiello's derivation of Quantum Geometry through an isometric embedding of
the spacetime ({\bf M},\tilde{g}) in the pseudo-Riemannian structure ({\bf

and the bundle %%@ formalism induce a Lorentzian-type structure in the
4-dimensional manifold {\bf M} that is covariant %%@ under arbitrary local
coordinate transformations in {\bf M}. If models with maximal acceleration are
required to be non-trivial, gravity should be supplied with other interactions

"A Case For Amplify-Forward Relaying in the Block-Fading Multi-Access
  Channel","This paper demonstrates the significant gains that multi-access users can
achieve from sharing a single amplify-forward relay in slow fading
environments. The proposed protocol, namely the multi-access relay
amplify-forward, allows for a low-complexity relay and achieves the optimal
diversity-multiplexing trade-off at high multiplexing gains. Analysis of the
protocol reveals that it uniformly dominates the compress-forward strategy and
further outperforms the dynamic decode-forward protocol at high multiplexing
gains. An interesting feature of the proposed protocol is that, at high
multiplexing gains, it resembles a multiple-input single-output system, and at
low multiplexing gains, it provides each user with the same
diversity-multiplexing trade-off as if there is no contention for the relay
from the other users.",2007-01-08T21:27:28Z
"Density Functional Simulation of Spontaneous Formation of Vesicle in
  Block Copolymer Solutions","We carry out numerical simulations of vesicle formation based on the density
functional theory for block copolymer solutions. It is shown by solving the
time evolution equations for concentrations that a polymer vesicle is
spontaneously formed from the homogeneous state. The vesicle formation
mechanism obtained by our simulation agree with the results of other
simulations based on the particle models as well as experiments. By changing
parameters such as the volume fraction of polymers or the Flory-Huggins
interaction parameter between the hydrophobic subchains and solvents, we can
obtain the spherical micelles, cylindrical micelles or bilayer structures, too.
We also show that the morphological transition dynamics of the micellar
structures can be reproduced by controlling the Flory-Huggins interaction
parameter.",2007-01-10T00:03:14Z
"Thermodynamical limit of general gl(N) spin chains: vacuum state and
  densities","We study the vacuum state of spin chains where each site carry an arbitrary
representation. We prove that the string hypothesis, usually used to solve the
Bethe ansatz equations, is valid for representations characterized by
rectangular Young tableaux. In these cases, we obtain the density of the center
of the strings for the vacuum. We work out different examples and, in
particular, the spin chains with periodic array of impurities.",2007-01-10T16:10:00Z
Why is a new Journal of Informetrics needed?,"In our study we analysed 3.889 records which were indexed in the Library and
Information Science Abstracts (LISA) database in the research field of
informetrics. We can show the core journals of the field via a Bradford (power
law) distribution and corroborate on the basis of the restricted LISA data set
that it was the appropriate time to found a new specialized journal dedicated
to informetrics. According to Bradford's Law of scattering (pure quantitative
calculation), Egghe's Journal of Informetrics (JOI) first issue to appear in
2007, comes most probable at the right time.",2007-01-17T12:17:53Z
Unitary polarized Fermi gases,"Although recent theoretical and experimental progress have considerably
clarified pairing mechanisms in spin 1/2 fermionic superfluid with equally
populated internal states, many open questions remain when the two spin
populations are mismatched. We show here that, taking advantage of the
universal behavior characterizing the regime of infinite scattering length, the
macroscopic properties of these systems can be simply and quantitatively
understood in the regime of strong interactions.",2007-01-15T20:37:12Z
"Dependence of electronic structure of SrRuO3 and the degree of
  correlation on cation off-stoichiometry","We have grown and studied high quality SrRuO3 films grown by MBE as well as
PLD. By changing the oxygen activity during deposition we were able to make
SrRuO3 samples that were stoichiometric (low oxygen activity) or with ruthenium
vacancies (high oxygen activity). Samples with strontium vacancies were found
impossible to produce since the ruthenium would precipitate out as RuO2. The
volume of the unit cell of SrRuO3 becomes larger as more ruthenium vacancies
are introduced. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) and room temperature
resistivity were found to systematically depend on the volume of the unit cell
and therefore on the amount of ruthenium vacancies. The RRR varied from ~30 for
stoichiometric samples to less than two for samples that were very ruthenium
poor. The room temperature resistivity varied from 190 microOhm cm for
stoichoimetric samples to over 300 microOhm cm for very ruthenium poor samples.
UPS spectra show a shift of weight from the coherent peak to the incoherent
peak around the Fermi level when samples have more ruthenium vacancies. Core
level XPS spectra of the ruthenium 3d lines show a strong screened part in the
case of stoichiometric samples. This screened part disappears when ruthenium
vacancies are introduced. Both the UPS and the XPS results are consistent with
the view that correlation increases as the amount of ruthenium vacancies
increase.",2007-02-02T18:00:58Z
"Phase Separation of Bismuth Ferrite into Magnetite under Voltage
  Stressing","Micro-Raman studies show that under ~700 kV/cm of d.c. voltage stressing for
a few seconds, thin-film bismuth ferrite BiFeO3 phase separates into magnetite
Fe3O4. No evidence is found spectroscopically of hemite alpha-Fe2O3, maghemite
gamma-Fe2O3, or of Bi2O3. This relates to the controversy regarding the
magnitude of magnetization in BiFeO3.",2007-03-14T21:25:01Z
"Energy-level ordering and ground-state quantum numbers for frustrated
  two-leg spin-1/2 ladder model","The Lieb-Mattis theorem about antiferromagnetic ordering of energy levels on
bipartite lattices is generalized to finite-size two-leg spin-1/2 ladder model
frustrated by diagonal interactions. For reflection-symmetric model with
site-dependent interactions we prove exactly that the lowest energies in
sectors with fixed total spin and reflection quantum numbers are monotone
increasing functions of total spin. The nondegeneracy of most levels is proved
also. We also establish the uniqueness and obtain the spin value of the
lowest-level multiplet in the whole sector formed by reflection-symmetric
(antisymmetric) states. For a wide range of coupling constants, we prove that
the ground state is a unique spin singlet. For other values of couplings, it
may be also a unique spin triplet or may consist of both multiplets. Similar
results have been obtained for the ladder with arbitrary boundary impurity
spin. Some partial results have also been obtained in the case of periodical
boundary conditions.",2007-02-06T16:09:58Z
Explosive hydrogen burning during type I X-ray bursts,"Explosive hydrogen burning in type I X-ray bursts (XRBs) comprise charged
particle reactions creating isotopes with masses up to A~100. Since charged
particle reactions in a stellar environment are very temperature sensitive, we
use a realistic time-dependent general relativistic and self-consistent model
of type I x-ray bursts to provide accurate values of the burst temperatures and
densities. This allows a detailed and accurate time-dependent identification of
the reaction flow from the surface layers through the convective region and the
ignition region to the neutron star ocean. Using this, we determine the
relative importance of specific nuclear reactions in the X-ray burst.",2007-03-13T14:02:56Z
Momentum dependent light scattering in insulating cuprates,"We investigate the problem of inelastic x-ray scattering in the spin$-{1/2}$
Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We first derive a momentum dependent
scattering operator for the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$ polarization geometries. On
the basis of a spin-wave analysis, including magnon-magnon interactions and
exact-diagonalizations, we determine the qualitative shape of the spectra. We
argue that our results may be relevant to help interpret inelastic x-ray
scattering experiments in the antiferromagnetic phase of the cuprates.",2007-01-12T20:33:36Z
Electronic structure and electric-field gradients analysis in $CeIn_3$,"Electric field gradients (EFG's) were calculated for the $CeIn_3$ compound at
both $^{115}In$ and $^{140}Ce$ sites. The calculations were performed within
the density functional theory (DFT) using the augmented plane waves plus local
orbital (APW+lo) method employing the so-called LDA+U scheme. The $CeIn_3$
compound were treated as nonmagnetic, ferromagnetic, and antiferromagnetic
cases. Our result shows that the calculated EFG's are dominated at the
$^{140}Ce$ site by the Ce-4f states. An approximately linear relation is
intuited between the main component of the EFG's and total density of states
(DOS) at Fermi level. The EFG's from our LDA+U calculations are in better
agreement with experiment than previous EFG results, where appropriate
correlations had not been taken into account among 4f-electrons. Our result
indicates that correlations among 4f-electrons play an important role in this
compound and must be taken into account.",2007-01-19T20:19:29Z
Anomalous SZ Contribution to 3 Year WMAP Data,"We first show that the new WMAP 3 year data confirm the detection by Myers et
al 2004 of an extended SZ signal centred on 606 Abell (ACO) clusters with
richness class, R>1. Our results also show SZ decrements around APM and 2MASS
groups at increased significance than previously detected. We then follow the
approach of Lieu et al 2006 and compare the stacked WMAP results for the
decrement in 31 clusters with ROSAT X-ray profiles where Lieu et al found on
average less SZ decrement in the WMAP 1 year data than predicted. We confirm
that in the 3 year data these same clusters again show less SZ decrement than
the X-ray data predicts. We then analysed the WMAP results for the 38 X-ray
clusters with OVRO/BIMA measured SZ decrements as presented by Bonamente et al
2006. We again find that the average decrement is measured to be significantly
less (5.5 sigma) than predicted by the Chandra X-ray data. Thus while we
confirm the original detection of an extended SZ effect by Myers et al 2004,
these X-ray comparisons may now suggest that the central SZ amplitudes detected
by WMAP may actually be lower than expected. One possible explanation is that
there is contamination of the WMAP SZ signal by radio sources in the clusters
but we argue that this appears implausible. We then consider the possibility
that the SZ decrement has been lensed away by foreground galaxy groups. Such a
model predicts that the SZ decrement should depend on cluster redshift. A
reduction in the SZ decrement with redshift is suggested from the ACO cluster
sample and also from comparing the samples of Lieu et al 2006 and Bonamente et
al 06. However, the mass power-spectrum would require a far higher amplitude
than currently expected if lensing was to explain the SZ deficit in high
redshift clusters.",2007-03-17T18:01:32Z
"Subgap tunneling via quantum-interference effect: insulators and charge
  density waves","A quantum interference effect is discussed for subgap tunneling over a
distance comparable to the coherence length, which is a consequence of
``advanced-advanced'' and ``retarded-retarded'' transmission modes [Altland and
Zirnbauer, Phys. Rev. B 55, 1142 (1997)]. Effects typical of disorder are
obtained from the interplay between multichannel averaging and higher order
processes in the tunnel amplitudes. Quantum interference effects similar to
those occurring in normal tunnel junctions explain magnetoresistance
oscillations of a CDW pierced by nanoholes [Latyshev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
78, 919 (1997)], having periodicity h/2e as a function of the flux enclosed in
the nanohole. Subgap tunneling is coupled to the sliding motion by charge
accumulation in the interrupted chains. The effect is within the same trend as
random matrix theory for normal metal-CDW hybrids [Visscher et al., Phys. Rev.
B 62, 6873 (2000)]. We suggest that the experiment by Latyshev et al. probes
weak localization-like properties of evanescent quasiparticles, not an
interference effect related to the quantum mechanical ground state.",2007-01-30T12:51:54Z
Third and fourth degree collisional moments for inelastic Maxwell models,"The third and fourth degree collisional moments for $d$-dimensional inelastic
Maxwell models are exactly evaluated in terms of the velocity moments, with
explicit expressions for the associated eigenvalues and cross coefficients as
functions of the coefficient of normal restitution. The results are applied to
the analysis of the time evolution of the moments (scaled with the thermal
speed) in the free cooling problem. It is observed that the characteristic
relaxation time toward the homogeneous cooling state decreases as the
anisotropy of the corresponding moment increases. In particular, in contrast to
what happens in the one-dimensional case, all the anisotropic moments of degree
equal to or less than four vanish in the homogeneous cooling state for $d\geq
2$.",2007-03-27T09:59:16Z
"Calibration and Pre-Compensation of Non-Common Path Aberrations for
  extreme Adaptive Optics","Non-Common Path Aberrations (NCPA) are one of the main limitations for
extreme Adaptive Optics (AO) system. NCPA prevent extreme AO systems to achieve
their ultimate performance. These static aberrations are unseen by the wave
front sensor and therefore not corrected in closed loop. We present
experimental results validating new procedures of measurement and
pre-compensation of the NCPA on the AO bench at ONERA. The measurement
procedure is based on new refined algorithms of phase diversity. The
pre-compensation procedure makes use of a pseudo-closed loop scheme to overcome
the AO wavefront sensor model uncertainties. Strehl Ratio obtained in the
images reaches 98.7% @ 632.8 nm. This result allows us to be confident of
achieving the challenging performance required for extrasolar planet direct
observation.",2007-03-05T13:28:58Z
Magneto and ferroelectric phase transitions in HoMn2O5 monocrystals,"From the physical point of view multiferroics present an extremely
interesting class of systems and problems. These are essentially of two kinds.
One is what are the microscopic conditions, and sometimes constrains, which
determine the possibility to combine in one system both magnetic and
ferroelectric properties. This turned out to be a quite nontrivial question,
and usually, in conventional systems, these two phenomena tend to exclude one
another. Why it is the case is an important and still not completely resolved
issue. In the present article we report our results from magnetic properties
measurements on HoMn2O5 with short discussion about it possible origin.",2007-01-27T18:28:24Z
Charge rearrangement and screening in a quantum point contact,"Compressibility measurements, sensitive to charge rearrangements, are
performed on a quantum point contact (QPC). Screening due to mobile charges in
the QPC is quantitatively measured, using a second point contact to detect the
screened electrical potential. These measurements are performed from pinch-off
through the opening of the first few modes in the QPC. While the measured
signal closely matches a Thomas-Fermi-Poisson prediction, deviations from the
classical behavior, in the form of additional dips, are apparent near the
openings of the different modes, with the largest dip at the opening of the
first mode. Density functional calculations attribute the first dip to exchange
interactions. The other dips reflect the diverging density of states at the
opening of each one-dimensional mode, which affects both kinetic and exchange
contributions to the energy.",2007-03-26T19:51:04Z
From Luttinger to Fermi liquids in organic conductors,"This chapter reviews the effects of interactions in quasi-one dimensional

between chains in the quasi-one dimensional structure.",2007-02-24T02:20:39Z
A Spinor Theory of Gravity and the Cosmological Framework,"Recently we have presented a new formulation of the theory of gravity based
on an implementation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle distinct from
General Relativity. The kinetic part of the theory - that describes how matter
is affected by the modified geometry due to the gravitational field - is the
same as in General Relativity. However, we do not consider the metric as an
independent field. Instead, it is an effective one, constructed in terms of two
fundamental spinor fields $\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ and thus the metric does not
have a dynamics of its own, but inherits its evolution through its relation
with the fundamental spinors. In the first paper it was shown that the metric
that describes the gravitational field generated by a compact static and
spherically symmetric configuration is very similar to the Schwarzschild
metric. In the present paper we describe the cosmological framework in the
realm of the Spinor Theory of Gravity.",2007-01-22T12:10:22Z
Quasi-Maxwell interpretation of the spin-curvature coupling,"We write the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations of motion for a spinning particle

"Generation of high-fidelity controlled-not logic gates by coupled
  superconducting qubits","Building on the previous results of the Weyl chamber steering method, we
demonstrate how to generate high-fidelity controlled-not by direct application
of certain, physically relevant Hamiltonians with fixed coupling constants
containing Rabi terms. Such Hamiltonians are often used to describe two
superconducting qubits driven by local rf-pulses.
  It is found that in order to achieve 100% fidelity in a system with
capacitive coupling of strength g one Rabi term suffices. We give the exact
values of the physical parameters needed to implement such CNOT. The gate time
and all possible Rabi frequencies are found to be t=pi/(2g) and Omega_1/g =
sqrt(64n^2-1), n=1,2,3,... .
  Generation of a perfect CNOT in a system with inductive coupling,
characterized by additional constant k, requires the presence of both Rabi
terms. The gate time is again t = pi/(2g), but now there is an infinite number
of solutions, each of which is valid in a certain range of k and is
characterized by a pair of positive integers (n,m). We distinguish two cases,
depending on the sign of the coupling constant:
  (1) the antiferromagnetic case (k>=0);
  (2) the ferromagnetic case (k<=0).
  The paper concludes with consideration of fidelity degradation by switching
to resonance. Simulation of time-evolution based on the 4th order Magnus
expansion reveals characteristics of the gate similar to those found in the
exact case, with slightly shorter gate time and shifted values of Rabi
frequencies.",2007-01-22T18:54:48Z

"A Physical Mechanism Underlying the Increase of Aqueous Solubility of

cold denaturation of proteins are established experimental facts. Both
phenomena have been hypothesized to be related to restructuring of the hydrogen
bond network of water around small nonpolar solutes or hydrophobic amino acid
side chains. However, an underlying physical mechanism has yet to be
identified. We assume the solute particles and the monomers of a polymer
interact via a hard sphere potential. We further assume that the solvent
molecules interact via the two-scale spherically symmetric Jagla potential,
which qualitatively reproduces the anomalies of water, such as expansion on
cooling. We find that this model correctly predicts the increase in solubility
of nonpolar compounds and the swelling of polymers on cooling. Our findings are
consistent with the possibility that the presence of two length scales in the
Jagla potential--a rigid hard core and a more flexible soft core--is
responsible for both phenomena. At low temperatures, the solvent particles
prefer to remain at the soft core distance, leaving enough space for small
nonpolar solutes to enter the solvent thus increasing solubility. We support
this hypothesized mechanism by molecular dynamic simulations.",2007-01-19T19:45:18Z
Integration of Acoustic Neutrino Detection Methods into ANTARES,"The ANTARES Neutrino Telescope is a water Cherenkov detector currently under
construction in the Mediterranean Sea. It is also designed to serve as a
platform for investigations of the deep-sea environment. In this context, the
ANTARES group at the University of Erlangen will integrate acoustic sensors
within the infrastructure of the experiment. With this dedicated setup, tests
of acoustic particle detection methods and deep-sea acoustic background studies
shall be performed. The aim of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of a
future acoustic neutrino telescope in the deep sea operating in the ultra-high
energy regime. In these proceedings, the implementation of the project is
described in the context of the premises and challenges set by the physics of
acoustic particle detection and the integration into an existing
infrastructure.",2007-03-16T15:37:05Z
The Luttinger liquid kink,"Although the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid exhibits spin-charge separation and
the electron is not an elementary excitation of the system, nevertheless an
effective electronic dispersion may be defined by the frequency-dependent peak
in the momentum distribution curve (MDC). The MDC is defined by considering the
single hole spectral function $A^<(\vec{k},\omega)$ as a function of $\vec{k}$
at a fixed frequency $\omega$. We show the existence of a \emph{kink} in this
dispersion for the spin-rotationally invariant Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid at
finite temperature. In the repulsive regime where the charge velocity $v_{c}$
is greater than the spin velocity $v_{s}$, the low frequency effective
electronic dispersion is linear in $\vec{k}$ and follows a velocity $v_l$
between the spin and charge velocities, $v_s < v_l < v_c$. The high frequency
part (which is also linear in $\vec{k}$) disperses with the charge velocity
$v_c$. The energy scale of the crossover between the two velocities defines a
kink, $E_{\rm kink}$. In addition, the high energy dispersion extrapolates to
the Fermi energy at a wavevector $k_{ex} \ne k_F$ which is shifted from the
Fermi wavevector. The presence of such a kink is measurable with, {\em e.g.},
angle-resolved photoemission experiments, and may be used to test for the
presence of Luttinger liquid behavior in systems in which the separate
contributions from spin and charge to the MDC are not discernible due to strong
interactions or low experimental resolution.",2007-03-04T09:01:49Z
Orbital fluctuations in the different phases of LaVO3 and YVO3,"We investigate the importance of quantum orbital fluctuations in the
orthorhombic and monoclinic phases of the Mott insulators LaVO3 and YVO3.
First, we construct ab-initio material-specific t2g Hubbard models. Then, by
using dynamical mean-field theory, we calculate the spectral matrix as a
function of temperature. Our Hubbard bands and Mott gaps are in very good
agreement with spectroscopy. We show that in orthorhombic LaVO3, quantum
orbital fluctuations are strong and that they are suppressed only in the
monoclinic 140 K phase. In YVO3 the suppression happens already at 300 K. We
show that Jahn-Teller and GdFeO3-type distortions are both crucial in
determining the type of orbital and magnetic order in the low temperature
phases.",2007-02-13T19:11:52Z
Random Kondo Alloys,"The interplay between the Kondo effect and disorder is studied. This is done
by applying a matrix coherent potential approximation (CPA) and treating the
Kondo interaction on a mean-field level. The resulting equations are shown to
agree with those derived by the dynamical mean-field method (DMFT). By applying
the formalism to a Bethe tree structure with infinite coordination the effect
of diagonal and off-diagonal disorder are studied. Special attention is paid to
the behavior of the Kondo- and the Fermi liquid temperature as function of
disorder and concentration of the Kondo ions. The non monotonous dependence of
these quantities is discussed.",2007-01-24T15:59:29Z
"Analysis of the emission of very small dust particles from Spitzer
  spectro-imagery data using blind signal separation methods","This work was conducted as part of the SPECPDR program, dedicated to the
study of very small particles and astrochemistry, in Photo-Dissociation Regions
(PDRs). We present the analysis of the mid-IR spectro-imagery observations of
Ced 201, NCG 7023 East and North-West and rho-Ophiuchi West filament. Using the
data from all four modules of the InfraRed Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer
Space Telescope, we produced a spectral cube ranging from 5 to 35 um for each
one of the observed PDRs. The resulting cubes were analysed using Blind Signal
Separation methods (NMF and FastICA). For Ced 201, rho-Ophiuchi West filament
and NGC 7023 East, we find that two signals can be extracted from the original
data cubes, which are 5 to 35 um spectra. The main features of the first
spectrum are a strong continuum emission at long wavelengths, and a broad 7.8
um band. On the contrary, the second spectrum exhibits the classical Aromatic
Infrared Bands (AIBs) and no continuum. The reconstructed spatial distribution
maps show that the latter spectrum is mainly present at the cloud surface,
close to the star whereas the first one is located slightly deeper inside the
PDR. The study of the spectral energy distribution of Ced 201 up to 100 um
suggests that, in cool PDRs, the 5-25 um continuum is carried by Very Small
Grains (VSGs). The AIB spectra in the observed objects can be interpreted as
the contribution of neutral and positively-charged Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extracted the 5 to 25 um emission spectrum of VSGs in
cool PDRs, these grains being most likely carbonaceous. We show that the
variations of the mid-IR (5-35 um) spectra of PDRs can be explained by the
photo-chemical processing of these VSGs and PAHs, VSGs being the progenitors of
free PAH.",2007-03-05T08:59:58Z
"Weak localization in a system with a barrier: Dephasing and weak Coulomb
  blockade","We non-perturbatively analyze the effect of electron-electron interactions on
weak localization (WL) in relatively short metallic conductors with a tunnel
barrier. We demonstrate that the main effect of interactions is electron
dephasing which persists down to T=0 and yields suppression of WL correction to
conductance below its non-interacting value. Our results may account for recent
observations of low temperature saturation of the electron decoherence time in
quantum dots.",2007-02-08T12:59:24Z
Where are the Cosmic Metals at z~3?,"The temperature distribution of the cosmic gas-phase oxygen at z~3 is
determined by combining high resolution cosmological simulations with the
observed, (rest-frame) V-band galaxy LF. The simulations invoke three different
stellar IMFs, a Kroupa (K98), a Salpeter (S) and an Arimoto-Yoshii (AY),
spanning a range of a factor of five in chemical yield and specific SNII energy
feedback.
  Oxygen is found in all T phases (cold: logT<~4, warm: logT~4.5, hot:
logT>~5), in particular for the (top-heavy) AY IMF. For the K98 and S IMFs, the
most important phase is the cold one. Moreover, the cold phase alone contains
1-3 times the mass of oxygen in galactic stars for the three IMFs. The
implications of this in relation to DLA studies are discussed.
  In relation to ``missing metals'' it is found that a significant fraction of
the oxygen is located in a warm/hot phase that may be very difficult to detect.
Moreover, it is found that less than about 20-25% of the cosmic oxygen is
associated with galaxies brighter than M_V~-22, the faintest LBGs probed by
current metallicity determinations.
  From the LBG based, lambda~1500 AA luminosity density history at z>3, the
mean oxygen density at z=3 is inferred. Comparing this to the models, it is
found that the (solar neighbourhood type) K98 IMF is strongly excluded (too
small yield), the S is marginally excluded, and the AY matches the constraint
well. The optimal IMF has a yield between the S and AY. A similar conclusion is
reached on the basis of the C IV abundance of the moderate density IGM.",2007-03-28T18:49:25Z
"Quantum rearrangement and self-consistent BCS-BEC crossover
  thermodynamics","Based on previous works, analytical calculational procedures for dealing with
the strongly interacting fermions ground state are further developed through a
medium dependent potential in terms of the Bethe-Peierls contact interaction
model. The methods are exact in the unitary limit regime and they lead to the
self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree ones. The single particle
energy spectrum rearrangement effects on the thermodynamics due to the
Hugenholtz-van Hove theorem constraint are addressed. These effects lead to an
additional instantaneous correlation potential contribution to the system
physical chemical potential and pressure, i.e., equation of state, which
enforces the classical thermodynamic consistency. The Dyson-Schwinger equations
represent implicitly the various Bethe-Goldstone expansion ones. In a
thermodynamically self-consistent way, the universal dimensionless factor is
analytically calculated to be $\xi=\049$, which defines the ratio of the
unitary fermions energy density to that of the ideal non-interacting ones at
T=0.",2007-02-24T14:20:32Z
The Octagon Abstract Domain,"This article presents a new numerical abstract domain for static analysis by
abstract interpretation. It extends a former numerical abstract domain based on
Difference-Bound Matrices and allows us to represent invariants of the form
(+/-x+/-y<=c), where x and y are program variables and c is a real constant. We
focus on giving an efficient representation based on Difference-Bound Matrices
- O(n2) memory cost, where n is the number of variables - and graph-based
algorithms for all common abstract operators - O(n3) time cost. This includes a
normal form algorithm to test equivalence of representation and a widening
operator to compute least fixpoint approximations.",2007-03-15T18:16:32Z
Exactly solvable models in atomic and molecular physics,"We construct integrable generalised models in a systematic way exploring
different representations of the gl(N) algebra. The models are then interpreted
in the context of atomic and molecular physics, most of them related to
different types of Bose-Einstein condensates. The spectrum of the models is
given through the analytical Bethe ansatz method. We further extend these
results to the case of the superalgebra gl(M|N), providing in this way models
which also include fermions.",2007-02-06T08:39:20Z
Structure and Magnetism of the mono-layer hydrate Na0.3NiO2 0.7H2O,"The mono-layer hydrate (Ni-MLH) Na0.3NiO2 0.7H2O was synthesized with an
average Ni valence close to one in the bi-layer hydrate (Ni-BLH) Na0.3NiO2
1.3H2O. A weak unsaturated ferromagnetism and divergence of the magnetic
susceptibilities of field and zero-field cooled samples of both Ni-MLH and
Ni-BLH are observed. However, as a result of the increased 3-dimensional
electronic and magnetic character present in Ni-MLH a frequency dependence of
the AC magnetic susceptibility indicative of the spin glass-like behavior as
seen in Ni-BLH was no longer observed in Ni-MLH.",2007-01-20T16:58:28Z
"Eclipsing binaries observed with the WIRE satellite. II. beta Aurigae
  and non-linear limb darkening in light curves","We present the most precise light curve ever obtained of a detached eclipsing
binary star and use it investigate the inclusion of non-linear limb darkening
laws in eclipsing binary light curve models. This light curve, of the bright
system beta Aurigae, was obtained using the star tracker aboard the WIRE
satellite and contains 30000 datapoints with a scatter of 0.3 mmag. We analyse
it using a version of the EBOP code modified to include non-linear limb
darkening and to directly incorporate observed times of minimum light and
spectroscopic light ratios into the solution as individual observations. We
also analyse the dataset with the WD code to ensure that the two models give
consistent results. EBOP provides an excellent fit to the WIRE data. Whilst the
fractional radii are only defined to a precision of 5%, including an accurate
published spectroscopic light ratio improves this dramatically to 0.5%. Using
non-linear limb darkening improves the quality of the fit significantly and
causes the measured radii to increase by 0.4%. It is possible to derive all of
the limb darkening coefficients from the light curve, although they are
strongly correlated with each other, and they agree with theoretical
predictions. The radii and masses of the components of beta Aur are R_A = 2.762
+/- 0.017 Rsun, R_B = 2.568 +/- 0.017 Rsun, M_A = 2.376 +/- 0.027 Msun and M_B
= 2.291 +/- 0.027 Msun. Theoretical stellar models can match these parameters
for a solar metal abundance and an age of 450-500 Myr. The Hipparcos
trigonometric parallax and an interferometrically-derived orbital parallax give
distances to beta Aur which are in excellent agreement with each other and with
distances derived using surface brightness relations and several sets of
empirical and theoretical bolometric corrections (abridged).",2007-03-25T00:46:27Z
"Variational wave functions, ground state and their overlap","An intrinsic measure of the quality of a variational wave function is given
by its overlap with the ground state of the system. We derive a general formula
to compute this overlap when quantum dynamics in imaginary time is accessible.
The overlap is simply related to the area under the $E(\tau)$ curve, i.e. the
energy as a function of imaginary time. This has important applications to, for
example, quantum Monte-Carlo algorithms where the overlap becomes as a simple
byproduct of routine simulations. As a result, we find that the practical
definition of a good variational wave function for quantum Monte-Carlo
simulations, {\it i.e.} fast convergence to the ground state, is equivalent to
a good overlap with the actual ground state of the system.",2007-02-28T22:03:55Z
Replica mean-field theory for Levy spin-glasses,"Infinite-range spin-glass models with Levy-distributed interactions show a
freezing transition similar to disordered spin systems on finite connectivity
random graphs. It is shown that despite diverging moments of the local field
distribution this transition can be analyzed within the replica approach by
working at imaginary temperature and using a variant of the replica method
developed for diluted systems and optimization problems. The replica-symmetric
self-consistent equation for the distribution of local fields illustrates how
the long tail in the distribution of coupling strengths gives rise to a
significant fraction of strong bonds per spin which form a percolating backbone
at the transition temperature.",2007-01-10T10:53:28Z
"Detection of finite frequency current moments with a dissipative
  resonant circuit","We consider the measurement of higher current moments with a dissipative
resonant circuit, which is coupled inductively to a mesoscopic device in the
coherent regime. Information about the higher current moments is coded in the
histograms of the charge on the capacitor plates of the resonant circuit.
Dissipation is included via the Caldeira-Leggett model, and it is essential to
include it in order for the charge fluctuations (or the measured noise) to
remain finite. We identify which combination of current correlators enter the
measurement of the third moment. The latter remains stable for zero damping.
Results are illustrated briefly for a quantum point contact.",2007-02-09T17:41:27Z
Power injected in a granular gas,"A granular gas may be modeled as a set of hard-spheres undergoing inelastic
collisions; its microscopic dynamics is thus strongly irreversible. As pointed
out in several experimental works bearing on turbulent flows or granular
materials, the power injected in a dissipative system to sustain a steady-state
over an asymptotically large time window is a central observable. We describe
an analytic approach allowing us to determine the full distribution of the
power injected in a granular gas within a steady-state resulting from
subjecting each particle independently either to a random force (stochastic
thermostat) or to a deterministic force proportional to its velocity (Gaussian
thermostat). We provide an analysis of our results in the light of the
relevance, for other types of systems, of the injected power to fluctuation
relations.",2007-03-05T14:58:59Z
Calculation of Elastic Constants of $γCe$,"In this paper we calculated the elastic constants of $\gamma Ce$. The
calculations were performed self-consistently using the full potential
augmented plane wave plus local orbital (FP-APW+lo) method. We used the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to calculate the exchange-correlation
energy. The elastic constants were obtained from the second order derivatives
of energy with respect to lattice parameters. In this work we introduced a
method to impose a deformation to the primary structure to simplify our
calculations changing an fcc structure to bct.",2007-01-23T19:00:12Z
Enhancement of Superconductivity by Exchange Bias,"In this work we study the transport properties of hybrids that consist of
exchange biased ferromagnets (FMs) combined with a low-Tc superconductor (SC).
Not only different FMs but also various structural topologies have been
investigated: results for multilayers of La(1-x)CaxMnO3 combined with Nb in the
form of [La0.33Ca0.67MnO3/La0.60Ca0.40MnO3]15/Nb, and for more simple
Ni80Fe20/Nb/Ni80Fe20 trilayers and Ni80Fe20/Nb bilayers are presented. The
results obtained in all hybrid structures studied in this work clearly uncover
that the exchange bias mechanism promotes superconductivity. Our findings
assist the understanding of the contradictory results that have been reported
in the recent literature regarding the transport properties of relative
FM/SC/FM spin valves.",2007-01-12T11:59:14Z
"Mott insulating phases and quantum phase transitions of interacting
  spin-3/2 fermionic cold atoms in optical lattices at half filling","We study various Mott insulating phases of interacting spin-3/2 fermionic
ultracold atoms in two-dimensional square optical lattices at half filling.
Using a generalized one-band Hubbard model with hidden SO(5) symmetry, we
identify two distinct symmetry breaking phases: the degenerate
antiferromagnetic spin-dipole/spin-octupole ordering and spin-quadrupole
ordering, depending on the sign of the spin-dependent interaction. These two
competing orders exhibit very different symmetry properties, low energy
excitations and topological characterizations. Near the SU(4) symmetric point,
a quantum critical state with a $\pi $-flux phase may emerge due to strong
quantum fluctuations, leading to spin algebraic correlations and gapless
excitations.",2007-03-12T06:29:59Z
Superlight small bipolarons,"Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has identified that
a finite-range Fr\""ohlich electron-phonon interaction (EPI) with c-axis
polarized optical phonons is important in cuprate superconductors, in agreement
with an earlier proposal by Alexandrov and Kornilovitch. The estimated
unscreened EPI is so strong that it could easily transform doped holes into
mobile lattice bipolarons in narrow-band Mott insulators such as cuprates.
Applying a continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo algorithm (CTQMC) we compute the
total energy, effective mass, pair radius, number of phonons and isotope
exponent of lattice bipolarons in the region of parameters where any
approximation might fail taking into account the Coulomb repulsion and the
finite-range EPI. The effects of modifying the interaction range and different
lattice geometries are discussed with regards to analytical
strong-coupling/non-adiabatic results. We demonstrate that bipolarons can be
simultaneously small and light, provided suitable conditions on the
electron-phonon and electron-electron interaction are satisfied. Such light
small bipolarons are a necessary precursor to high-temperature Bose-Einstein
condensation in solids. The light bipolaron mass is shown to be universal in
systems made of triangular plaquettes, due to a novel crab-like motion. Another
surprising result is that the triplet-singlet exchange energy is of the first
order in the hopping integral and triplet bipolarons are heavier than singlets
in certain lattice structures at variance with intuitive expectations. Finally,
we identify a range of lattices where superlight small bipolarons may be
formed, and give estimates for their masses in the anti-adiabatic
approximation.",2007-02-21T15:20:40Z
Finite-size scaling in complex networks,"A finite-size-scaling (FSS) theory is proposed for various models in complex
networks. In particular, we focus on the FSS exponent, which plays a crucial
role in analyzing numerical data for finite-size systems. Based on the
droplet-excitation (hyperscaling) argument, we conjecture the values of the FSS
exponents for the Ising model, the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, and
the contact process, all of which are confirmed reasonably well in numerical
simulations.",2007-01-22T12:45:00Z
Sum Rules for the Optical and Hall Conductivity in Graphene,"Graphene has two atoms per unit cell with quasiparticles exhibiting the
Dirac-like behavior. These properties lead to interband in addition to
intraband optical transitions and modify the $f$-sum rule on the longitudinal
conductivity. The expected dependence of the corresponding spectral weight on
the applied gate voltage $V_g$ in a field effect graphene transistor is $\sim
{const}- |V_g|^{3/2}$. For $V_g =0$, its temperature dependence is $T^3$ rather
than the usual $T^2$. For the Hall conductivity, the corresponding spectral
weight is determined by the Hall frequency $\omega_H$ which is linear in the
carrier imbalance density $\rho$, and hence proportional to $V_g$, and is
different from the cyclotron frequency for Dirac quasiparticles.",2007-01-03T17:49:36Z
Cooperation Between Stations in Wireless Networks,"In a wireless network, mobile nodes (MNs) repeatedly perform tasks such as
layer 2 (L2) handoff, layer 3 (L3) handoff and authentication. These tasks are
critical, particularly for real-time applications such as VoIP. We propose a
novel approach, namely Cooperative Roaming (CR), in which MNs can collaborate
with each other and share useful information about the network in which they
move. We show how we can achieve seamless L2 and L3 handoffs regardless of the
authentication mechanism used and without any changes to either the
infrastructure or the protocol. In particular, we provide a working
implementation of CR and show how, with CR, MNs can achieve a total L2+L3
handoff time of less than 16 ms in an open network and of about 21 ms in an
IEEE 802.11i network. We consider behaviors typical of IEEE 802.11 networks,
although many of the concepts and problems addressed here apply to any kind of
mobile network.",2007-01-08T20:01:34Z
Failure avalanches in fiber bundles for discrete load increase,"The statistics of burst avalanche sizes $n$ during failure processes in a
fiber bundle follows a power law, $D(n)\sim n^{-\xi}$, for large avalanches.
The exponent $\xi$ depends upon how the avalanches are provoked. While it is
known that when the load on the bundle is increased in a continuous manner, the
exponent takes the value $\xi=5/2$, we show that when the external load is
increased in discrete and not too small steps, the exponent value $\xi=3$ is
relevant. Our analytic treatment applies to bundles with a general probability
distribution of the breakdown thresholds for the individual fibers. The
pre-asymptotic size distribution of avalanches is also considered.",2007-01-11T11:19:24Z
A Search for Radio Continuum Emission Towards Long-period Variable Stars,"We hereby report on a sensitive search for radio continuum observations from
a sample of 34 Mira and semi-regular variable stars. The main aim of this
survey was to search for thermal free-free emission from post-shock ionised
gas. Thirty-four stars were observed at 3- and 6-cm using the Australia
Telescope Compact Array. Radio continuum emission was detected from one source
only, the symbiotic Mira R Aqr. No continuum emission was detected from the
other sources, with three-sigma upper limits of typically 0.3 mJy. From the
upper limits to the radio flux densities, we have found upper limits to the gas
brightness temperatures near two stellar radii at a characteristic size of
$5\times10^{13}$ cm. Upper limits to shock velocities have been estimated using
a shock model. For the 11 nearest sources in our sample we obtain brightness
temperatures below 6 000 K and shock velocities below 13 km s$^{-1}$. For 11
out of 14 sources with previously published detections, the radio brightness
temperatures are below 4 000 K. For an upper limit of 4 000 K, we estimate that
the shock velocities at two stellar radii are below 10 km s$^{-1}$.",2007-03-27T00:33:39Z
Microscopic theory of the quantum Hall hierarchy,"We solve the quantum Hall problem exactly in a limit and show that the ground
states can be organized in a fractal pattern consistent with the
Haldane-Halperin hierarchy, and with the global phase diagram. We present wave
functions for a large family of states, including those of Laughlin and Jain
and also for states recently observed by Pan {\it et. al.}, and show that they
coincide with the exact ones in the solvable limit. We submit that they
establish an adiabatic continuation of our exact results to the experimentally
accessible regime, thus providing a unified approach to the hierarchy states.",2007-02-22T15:22:37Z
"Simultaneous X-ray, radio, near-infrared, and optical monitoring of
  Young Stellar Objects in the Coronet cluster","Multi-wavelength (X-ray to radio) monitoring of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs)
can provide important information about physical processes at the stellar
surface, in the stellar corona, and/or in the inner circumstellar disk regions.
While coronal processes should mainly cause variations in the X-ray and radio
bands, accretion processes may be traced by time-correlated variability in the
X-ray and optical/infrared bands. Several multi-wavelength studies have been
successfully performed for field stars and approx. 1-10 Myr old T Tauri stars,
but so far no such study succeeded in detecting simultaneous X-ray to radio
variability in extremely young objects like class I and class 0 protostars.
Here we present the first simultaneous X-ray, radio, near-infrared, and optical
monitoring of YSOs, targeting the Coronet cluster in the Corona Australis
star-forming region, which harbors at least one class 0 protostar, several
class I objects, numerous T Tauri stars, and a few Herbig AeBe stars. [...]
Seven objects are detected simultaneously in the X-ray, radio, and
optical/infrared bands; they constitute our core sample. While most of these
sources exhibit clear variability in the X-ray regime and several also display
optical/infrared variability, none of them shows significant radio variability
on the timescales probed. We also do not find any case of clearly
time-correlated optical/infrared and X-ray variability. [...] The absence of
time-correlated multi-wavelength variability suggests that there is no direct
link between the X-ray and optical/infrared emission and supports the notion
that accretion is not an important source for the X-ray emission of these YSOs.
No significant radio variability was found on timescales of days.",2007-03-13T15:12:55Z
Authentication via wireless networks,"Personal authentication is an important process we encounter almost every
day; when we are logging on a computer, entering a company where we work, or a
restricted area, when we are using our plastic credit cards to pay for a
service or to complete some other financial transaction, etc. In each of these
processes of personal authentication some kind of magnetic or optical token is
required. But by using novel technologies like mobile computing and wireless
networking, it is possible to avoid carrying multitude of ID cards or
remembering a number of PIN codes. Article shows how to efficiently
authenticate users via Personal Area Networks (PAN) like Bluetooth or IrDA
using commonplace AES (Rijndel) or MD5 encryption. This method can be
implemented on many types of mobile devices like Pocket PC PDA with Windows CE
(Windows Mobile 2003) real-time operating system, or any other customized OS,
so we will explain all components and key features of such basic system.",2007-02-16T16:46:59Z
"Stochastic Gross-Pitaevsky Equation for BEC via Coarse-Grained Effective
  Action","We sketch the major steps in a functional integral derivation of a new set of
Stochastic Gross-Pitaevsky equations (GPE) for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
confined to a trap at zero temperature with the averaged effects of
non-condensate modes incorporated as stochastic sources. The closed-time-path
(CTP) coarse-grained effective action (CGEA) or the equivalent influence
functional method is particularly suitable because it can account for the full
back-reaction of the noncondensate modes on the condensate dynamics
self-consistently. The Langevin equations derived here containing nonlocal
dissipation together with colored and multiplicative noises are useful for a
stochastic (as distinguished from say, a kinetic) description of the
nonequilibrium dynamics of a BEC. This short paper contains original research
results not yet published anywhere.",2007-02-02T20:58:51Z
Magnetic Susceptibility of the Kagome Antiferromagnet ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2,"We analyze the experimental data for the magnetic susceptibility of the
material ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 in terms of the Kagome Lattice Heisenberg model (KLHM),
discussing possible role of impurity spins, dilution, exchange anisotropy, and
both out-of-plane and in-plane Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) anisotropies, with
explicit theoretical calculations using the Numerical Linked Cluster (NLC)
method and exact diagonalization (ED). The high-temperature experimental data
are well described by the pure Heisenberg model with J=170 K. We show that the
sudden upturn in the susceptibility around T=75 K is due to DM interactions. We
also observe that at intermediate temperatures, below T=J, our calculated
susceptibility for KLHM fits well with a power law T^{-0.25}.",2007-01-04T21:22:46Z
"Pitch Tracking of Acoustic Signals based on Average Squared Mean
  Difference Function","In this paper, a method of pitch tracking based on variance minimization of
locally periodic subsamples of an acoustic signal is presented. Replicates
along the length of the periodically sampled data of the signal vector are
taken and locally averaged sample variances are minimized to estimate the
fundamental frequency. Using this method, pitch tracking of any text

"Local density of states and Friedel oscillations around a non-magnetic
  impurity in unconventional density wave","We present a mean-field theoretical study on the effect of a single
non-magnetic impurity in quasi-one dimensional unconventional density wave. The
local scattering potential is treated within the self-consistent $T$-matrix
approximation. The local density of states around the impurity shows the
presence of resonant states in the vicinity of the Fermi level, much the same
way as in $d$-density waves or unconventional superconductors. The assumption
for different forward and backscattering, characteristic to quasi-one
dimensional systems in general, leads to a resonance state that is double
peaked in the pseudogap. The Friedel oscillations around the impurity are also
explored in great detail, both within and beyond the density wave coherence
length $\xi_0$. Beyond $\xi_0$ we find power law behavior as opposed to the
exponential decay of conventional density wave. The entropy and specific heat
contribution of the impurity are also calculated for arbitrary scattering
strengths.",2007-01-29T22:52:26Z
"Model Independent Reconstruction of the Expansion History of the
  Universe and the Properties of Dark Energy","We have improved upon the method of smoothing supernovae data to reconstruct
the expansion history of the universe, h(z), using two latest datasets, Gold
and SNLS. The reconstruction process does not employ any parameterization and
is independent of any dark energy model. The reconstructed h(z) is used to
derive the distance factor ""A"" up to redshift 0.35 and the results are compared
with the given value of ""A"" from detection of baryon acoustic oscillation peak
(BAO). We find very good agreement between supernovae observations and the
results from BAO for \Omega_{0m} \approx 0.276 \pm 0.023. The estimated values
of \Omega_{0m} are completely model-independent and are only based on
observational data. The derived values of \Omega_{0m} are then used to
reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy, w(z). Using our smoothing
method we can demonstrate that while SNLS data are in very good agreement with
LCDM, the Gold sample slightly prefers evolving dark energy. We also show that
proper estimation of the equation of state of dark energy at the high redshifts
would be impossible at the current status of observations.",2007-03-02T19:13:22Z
Spin-modulated quasi-1D antiferromagnet LiCuVO_4,"We report on magnetic resonance studies within the magnetically ordered phase
of the quasi-1D antiferromagnet LiCuVO_4. Our studies reveal a spin
reorientational transition at a magnetic field H_c1 ~ 25 kOe applied within the
crystallographical (ab)-plane in addition to the recently observed one at H_c2
\~75 kOe [ M.G. Banks et al., cond-mat/0608554 (2006)]. Spectra of the
antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) along low-frequency branches can be
described in the frame of a macroscopic theory of exchange-rigid planar
magnetic structures. These data allow to obtain the anisotropy of the exchange
interaction together with a constant of the uniaxial anisotropy. Spectra of 7Li
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) show that, within the magnetically ordered
phase of LiCuVO_4 in the low-field range H < H_c1, a planar spiral spin
structure is realized with the spins lying in the (ab)-plane in agreement with
neutron scattering studies of B.J. Gibson et al. [Physica B Vol. 350, 253
(2004)]. Based on NMR spectra simulations, the transition at H_c1 can well be
described as a spin-flop transition, where the spin plane of the magnetically
ordered structure rotates to be perpendicular to the direction of the applied
magnetic field. For H > H_c2 ~ 75 kOe, our NMR spectra simulations show that
the magnetically ordered structure exhibits a modulation of the spin
projections along the direction of the applied magnetic field H.",2007-01-04T18:43:20Z
"Magnetization reversal in the orthovanadate RVO3 compounds (R = La, Nd,
  Sm, Gd, Er and Y): Inhomogeneities caused by defects in the orbital sector of
  quasi-one-dimensional orbital systems","We report on a study of various RVO3 single-crystal samples (R = La, Nd, Sm,
Gd, Er and Y) which show temperature-induced magnetization reversal. For
compounds with lighter rare-earths (R = La, Nd and Sm), magnetization reversal
can be observed for magnetic field applied in the ab plane and along the c
axis, whereas for the heavy rare-earths (R = Gd, Er) magnetization reversal is
only observed when the field is applied along the a axis. YVO3 has a
magnetization reversal along all the main crystallographic axes in a modest
applied field. We have found that some compounds are very sensitive to small
trapped fields present in the superconducting solenoid of the magnetometer
during the cooling. Based on the observed results, we argue that inhomogeniety
caused by defects in the orbital sector in the quasi one-dimensional orbital
systems could account for the unusual magnetization reversal.",2007-02-22T16:44:42Z
"Effective action of the weakly doped t-J model and spin-wave excitations
  in the spin-glass phase of La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4","We derive the low-energy effective field theory of the extended t-J model in
the regime of light doping. The action includes a previously unknown Berry
phase term, which is discussed in detail. We use this effective field theory to
calculate spin-wave excitations in the disordered spin spiral state of
La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 (the spin-glass phase). We predict an excitation spectrum
with two distinct branches: The in-plane mode has the usual linear spin-wave
dispersion and the out-of-plane mode shows non-trivial doping dependent
features. We also calculate the intensities for inelastic neutron scattering in
these modes.",2007-03-07T07:29:29Z
Transverse transport in graphite,"Graphite is a layered material showing a strong anisotropy. Among the
unconventional properties reported by experiments, the electronic transport
along the c-axis, which has direct implications in order to build graphitic
devices, remains a controversial topic. We study the influence of inelastic
scattering on the electron tunnelling between layers. In the presence of
electron electron interactions, tunnelling processes are modified by inelastic
scattering events.",2007-03-08T11:29:00Z
"Universal temperature dependence of the magnetization of gapped spin
  chains","Temperature dependence of the magnetization of the Haldane spin chain at
finite magnetic field is analyzed systematically. Quantum Monte Carlo data
indicates a clear minimum of magnetization as a function of temperature in the
gapless regime. On the basis of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory, we argue
that this minimum is rather universal and can be observed for general axially
symmetric quasi-one-dimensional spin systems. Our argument is confirmed by the
magnetic-field dependence of the spin-wave velocity obtained numerically. One
can estimate a magnitude of the gap of any such systems by fitting the
experimental data with the magnetization minimum.",2007-03-27T20:05:25Z
Statistics of Deep Energy States in Coulomb Glasses,"We study the statistics of local energy minima in the configuration space and
the energy relaxation due to activated hopping in a system of interacting
electrons in a random environment. The distribution of the local minima is
exponential, which is in agreement with extreme value statistics
considerations. The relaxation of the system energy shows logarithmic time
dependence reflecting the ultrametric structure of the system.",2007-01-10T20:32:29Z
Breathing modes of a fast rotating Fermi gas,"We derive the frequency spectrum of the lowest compressional oscillations of
a 3D harmonically trapped Fermi superfluid in the presence of a vortex lattice,
treated in the diffused vorticity approximation within a hydrodynamic approach.
We consider the general case of a superfluid at T=0 characterized by a
polytropic equation of state ($\sim{n}^\gamma$), which includes both the
Bose-Einstein condensed regime of dimers ($\gamma=1$) and the unitary limit of
infinite scattering length ($\gamma=2/3$). Important limiting cases are
considered, including the centrifugal limit, the isotropic trapping and the
cigar geometry. The conditions required to enter the lowest Landau level and
quantum Hall regimes at unitarity are also discussed.",2007-02-13T18:20:22Z
Upper limit map of a background of gravitational waves,"We searched for an anisotropic background of gravitational waves using data
from the LIGO S4 science run and a method that is optimized for point sources.
This is appropriate if, for example, the gravitational wave background is
dominated by a small number of distinct astrophysical sources. No signal was
seen. Upper limit maps were produced assuming two different power laws for the
source strain power spectrum. For an f^-3 power law and using the 50 Hz to 1.8
kHz band the upper limits on the source strain power spectrum vary between
1.2e-48 Hz^-1 (100 Hz/f)^3 and 1.2e-47 Hz^-1 (100 Hz /f)^3, depending on the
position in the sky. Similarly, in the case of constant strain power spectrum,
the upper limits vary between 8.5e-49 Hz^-1 and 6.1e-48 Hz^-1.
  As a side product a limit on an isotropic background of gravitational waves
was also obtained. All limits are at the 90% confidence level. Finally, as an
application, we focused on the direction of Sco-X1, the closest low-mass X-ray
binary. We compare the upper limit on strain amplitude obtained by this method
to expectations based on the X-ray luminosity of Sco-X1.",2007-03-09T23:10:07Z
Failure avalanches in fiber bundles for discrete load increase,"The statistics of burst avalanche sizes $n$ during failure processes in a
fiber bundle follows a power law, $D(n)\sim n^{-\xi}$, for large avalanches.
The exponent $\xi$ depends upon how the avalanches are provoked. While it is
known that when the load on the bundle is increased in a continuous manner, the
exponent takes the value $\xi=5/2$, we show that when the external load is
increased in discrete and not too small steps, the exponent value $\xi=3$ is
relevant. Our analytic treatment applies to bundles with a general probability
distribution of the breakdown thresholds for the individual fibers. The
pre-asymptotic size distribution of avalanches is also considered.",2007-01-11T11:19:24Z
"Wavefront singularities associated with the conical point in elastic
  solids with cubic symmetry","The wavefronts from a point source in a solid with cubic symmetry are
examined with particular attention paid to the contribution from the conical
points of the slowness surface. An asymptotic solution is developed that is
uniform across the edge of the cone in real space, the interior of which
contains the plane lid wavefront analyzed by Burridge \cite{Burridge67}. The
uniform solution also contains the regular wavefronts away from the cone edge,
a delta pulse on one side and its Hilbert transform on the other. In the
direction of the cone edge the three wavefronts merge to produce a singularity
of the form $H(t) t^{-3/4}$.",2007-02-06T01:34:11Z
Ordered droplets in quantum magnets with long-range interactions,"A defect coupling to the square of the order parameter in a nearly
quantum-critical magnet can nucleate an ordered droplet while the bulk system
is in the paramagnetic phase. We study the influence of long-range spatial
interactions of the form $r^{-(d+\sigma)}$ on the droplet formation. To this
end, we solve a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson free energy in saddle point
approximation. The long-range interaction causes the droplet to develop an
energetically unfavorable power-law tail. However, for $\sigma>0$, the free
energy contribution of this tail is subleading in the limit of large droplets;
and the droplet formation is controlled by the defect bulk. Thus, for large
defects, long-range interactions do not hinder the formation of droplets.",2007-03-21T15:43:31Z
"Controllable Josephson-Like Tunneling in Two-Component Bose-Einstein
  Condensates Coupled with Microwave via Feshbach Resonance and Trapping
  Potential","We put forward a scheme for controlling Josephson-like tunneling in
two-component Bose-Einstein condensates coupled with microwave field via
Feshbach resonance and tuning aspect ratio of trapping potential. We prove how
to realize a perfect periodic oscillation from a fast damped and irregular
oscillation on relative number of atoms in future experiment. In particular,
intensity of Josephson-like tunneling can be successfully controlled through
controlling speed of recovering the initial value of intra-atomic interaction
and aspect ratio of trapping potential. Interestingly, we find that relative
number of atoms represents two different types of oscillation in respond to
periodic modulation of attractive intra-atomic interaction.",2007-03-06T17:35:18Z
Lifting of Ir{100} reconstruction by CO adsorption: An ab initio study,"The adsorption of CO on unreconstructed and reconstructed Ir{100} has been
studied, using a combination of density functional theory and thermodynamics,
to determine the relative stability of the two phases as a function of CO
coverage, temperature and pressure. We obtain good agreement with
experimentaldata. At zero temperature, the (1X5) reconstruction becomes less
stable than the unreconstructed (1X1) surface when the CO coverage exceeds a
critical value of 0.09 ML. The interaction between CO molecules is found to be
repulsive on the reconstructed surface, but attractive on the unreconstructed,
explaining the experimental observation of high CO coverage on growing (1X1)
islands. At all temperatures and pressures, we find only two possible stable
states: 0.05 ML CO c(2X2) overlayer on the (1X1) substrate, and the clean
(1$\times$5) reconstructed surface.",2007-01-24T14:36:35Z
"Transfer-matrix renormalization group study of the spin ladders with
  cyclic four-spin interactions","The temperature dependence of the specific heat and spin susceptibility of
the spin ladders with cyclic four-spin interactions in the rung-singlet phase
is explored by making use of the transfer-matrix renormalization group method.
The values of spin gap are extracted from the specific heat and susceptibility,
respectively. It is found that for different relative strength between
interchain and intrachain interactions, the spin gap is approximately linear
with the cyclic four-spin interaction in the region far away from the critical
point. Furthermore, we show that the dispersion for the one-triplet magnon
branch can be obtained by numerically fitting on the partition function.",2007-01-11T14:05:53Z
"Core-Level Photoelectron Spectroscopy Probing Local Strain at Silicon
  Surfaces and Interfaces","Using a first-principles approach, we investigate the origin of the fine
structure in Si 2$p$ photoelectron spectra at the Si(100)2$\times$1 surface and
at the Si(100)-SiO$_2$ interface. Calculated and measured shifts show very good
agreement for both systems. By using maximally localized Wannier functions, we
provide an interpretation in which the effects due to the electronegativity of
second nearest neighbor atoms and due to the local strain field are
distinguished. Hence, in combination with accurate modeling, photoelectron
spectroscopy can provide a direct measure of the strain field at the atomic
scale.",2007-03-15T19:26:11Z
Alignment of the spins of supermassive black holes prior to coalescence,"Recent numerical relativistic simulations of black hole coalescence suggest
that in certain alignments the emission of gravitational radiation can produce
a kick of several thousand kilometers per second. This exceeds galactic escape
speeds, hence unless there a mechanism to prevent this, one would expect many
galaxies that had merged to be without a central black hole. Here we show that
in most galactic mergers, torques from accreting gas suffice to align the orbit
and spins of both black holes with the large-scale gas flow. Such a
configuration has a maximum kick speed <200 km/s, safely below galactic escape
speeds. We predict, however, that in mergers of galaxies without much gas, the
remnant will be kicked out several percent of the time. We also discuss other
predictions of our scenario, including implications for jet alignment angles
and X-type radio sources.",2007-03-05T19:40:28Z
Long Term Friction: from Stick-Slip to Stable Sliding,"We have devised an original laboratory experiment where we investigate the
frictional behaviour of a single crystal salt slider over a large number of
deformation cycles. Because of its physical properties, salt, a surrogate for
natural faults, allows for friction and plastic deformation and pressure
solution creep to be efficient on the same timescale. During the same
experiment, we observe a continuous change of the frictional behaviour of the
slider under constant conditions of stiffness, temperature and loading
velocity. The stick-slip regime is progressively vanishing, eventually reaching
the stable sliding regime. Concomitantly, the contact interface, observed under
the microscope, develops a striated morphology with contact asperities increase
in length and width, arguing for an increase in the critical slip distance dc.
Complementary experiments including velocity jumps show that the frictional
parameters of the rate and state friction law, a and b, progressively vanish
with the cumulative slip. In our experimental conditions, the ultimate stage of
friction is therefore rate and state independent.",2007-02-16T15:19:48Z
"Phase diagram and Raman Imaging of Grain Growth Mechanisms in Highly
  Textured Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 Piezoelectric Ceramics","Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 solid solution (PMN(1-x)-PTx) ceramics with 0 <x<1
have been prepared by homo-epitaxial templated grain growth (HTGG) using cubic
PMN-PT single crystal seeds as templates and nanoparticles for thes ceramic
matrix. Samples were prepared using the doctor Blade method and sintered in a
controlled atmosphere. They were then analysed by DTA, TGA, optical/scanning
electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and imaging. Relationships between
Raman parameters such as band component or area versus composition (x) are
proposed. Wavenumber and peak area shifts from the single crystal seed centre
to periphery growth are assigned to compositional change. Representative medium
to highly textured ceramics with Lotgering factors of ~0.7 and 0.9 were
sintered at 1150 degrees C and 1200 degrees C, respectively, and studied by
direct and smart Raman imaging. The Raman peak centre of gravity depends on the
solid solution composition whereas peak intensity is correlated to the
unit-cell distorsion and related short-range structure. Two different growth
mechanisms are observed: below ~1200 degrees C, sharp corner and straight edged
single crystal seeds develop through a liquid I phase at the crystal/matrix
interface; at higher temperatures, the matrix is consumed and crystal growth
develops in contact with a liquid II phase, through the help of the high PbO
partial pressure. Smart Raman imaging shows that the final composition and
structure is very close to that of the matrix. Formation of short-range ordered
B/B' domains is expected. A phase diagram is proposed.",2007-01-15T21:01:39Z
"Investigation of the structure and thermodynamics of star-polymers in
  semi-dilute solution","In this work, we consider a semi-dilute solution of identical star-polymers,
made of attached flexible long polymer chains of the same polymerization degree
N. We first compute the effective pair-potential between star-polymers. Such a
potential results from the excluded volume forces between monomers. We show
that this potential is logarithmic, below some known characteristic distance,
&#963;, depending on the number of attached chains per star-polymer, f, and
volume fraction of polymers, &#966;0 . Beyond &#963;, the potential fails
exponentially. Second, we investigate the structure and thermodynamics of these
star-polymers. To this end, we use the integral equation method with the
hybridized-mean spherical approximation. The numerical resolution of this
equation gives the structure factor of the star-polymers, for various particle
densities. Finally, the standard relationships between thermodynamics and
structure enable us to deduce three physical quantities, namely the isotherm
compressibility, pressure and internal energy, as functions of density.",2007-03-21T21:06:42Z
On Random Network Coding for Multicast,"Random linear network coding is a particularly decentralized approach to the
multicast problem. Use of random network codes introduces a non-zero
probability however that some sinks will not be able to successfully decode the
required sources. One of the main theoretical motivations for random network
codes stems from the lower bound on the probability of successful decoding
reported by Ho et. al. (2003). This result demonstrates that all sinks in a
linearly solvable network can successfully decode all sources provided that the
random code field size is large enough. This paper develops a new bound on the
probability of successful decoding.",2007-02-09T01:39:47Z
Non-linear vector perturbations in a contracting universe,"A number of scalar field models proposed as alternatives to the standard
inflationary scenario involve contracting phases which precede the universe's
present phase of expansion. An important question concerning such models is
whether there are effects which could potentially distinguish them from purely
expanding cosmologies. Vector perturbations have recently been considered in
this context. At first order such perturbations are not supported by a scalar
field. In this paper, therefore, we consider second order vector perturbations.
We show that such perturbations are generated by first order scalar mode-mode
couplings, and give an explicit expression for them. We compare the magnitude
of vector perturbations produced in collapsing models with the corresponding
amplitudes produced during inflation, using a number of suitable power-law
solutions to model the inflationary and collapsing scenarios. We conclude that
the ratios of the magnitudes of these perturbations depend on the details of
the collapsing scenario as well as on how the hot big bang is recovered, but
for certain cases could be large, growing with the duration of the collapse.",2007-02-12T18:04:14Z
Bright solitons and soliton trains in a fermion-fermion mixture,"We use a time-dependent dynamical mean-field-hydrodynamic model to predict
and study bright solitons in a degenerate fermion-fermion mixture in a
quasi-one-dimensional cigar-shaped geometry using variational and numerical
methods. Due to a strong Pauli-blocking repulsion among identical
spin-polarized fermions at short distances there cannot be bright solitons for
repulsive interspecies fermion-fermion interactions. However, stable bright
solitons can be formed for a sufficiently attractive interspecies interaction.
We perform a numerical stability analysis of these solitons and also
demonstrate the formation of soliton trains. These fermionic solitons can be
formed and studied in laboratory with present technology.",2007-02-07T14:29:07Z
"Electron spin quantum beats in positively charged quantum dots: nuclear
  field effects","We have studied the electron spin coherence in an ensemble of positively
charged InAs/GaAs quantum dots. In a transverse magnetic field, we show that
two main contributions must be taken into account to explain the damping of the
circular polarization oscillations. The first one is due to the nuclear field
fluctuations from dot to dot experienced by the electron spin. The second one
is due to the dispersion of the transverse electron Lande g-factor, due to the
inherent inhomogeneity of the system, and leads to a field dependent
contribution to the damping. We have developed a model taking into account both
contributions, which is in good agreement with the experimental data. This
enables us to extract the pure contribution to dephasing due to the nuclei.",2007-01-12T17:13:58Z
"Harmonic polynomials for expanding the fluctuations of the Cosmic
  Microwave Background: The Poincare and the 3-sphere model","Fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB are observed by the WMAP.
When expanded into the harmonic eigenmodes of the space part of a cosmological
model, they provide insight into the large-scale topology of space. All
harmonic polynomials on the multiply connected dodecahedral Poincare space are
constructed. Strong and specific selection rules are given by comparing the
polynomials to those on the 3-sphere, its simply connected cover.",2007-01-01T19:01:50Z
Competition between Vortex Unbinding and Tunneling in an Optical Lattice,"We study a system of two-dimensional Bose gases trapped in minima of a deep
one-dimensional optical lattice potential. Increasing the tunneling amplitude
between adjacent gases drives a deconfinement transition to a phase where
coherence is established between neighboring two-dimensional gases. We compute
the signature of this transition in the interference pattern of the system as
well as in its rotational response, which provides a direct measurement of the
superfluidity in the system.",2007-01-30T21:00:30Z
High-energy magnetic excitations from dynamic stripes in LBCO (x=1/8),"We use inelastic neutron scattering to study the temperature dependence of
magnetic excitations (for energies up to 100 meV) in the cuprate
La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$. This compound exhibits stripe order below a
temperature of ~50 K; previous measurements have shown that the magnetic
excitations of the stripe-ordered phase have an hour-glass-like dispersion,
with a saddle point at ~50 meV. Here we compare measurements in the disordered
phase taken at 65 and 300 K. At energies on the scale of $k_{\rm B}T$, there is
substantial momentum-broadening of the signal, and the low-energy
incommensurate features can no longer be resolved at 300 K. In contrast, there
is remarkably little change in the scattered signal for energies greater than
$k_{\rm B}T$. In fact, the momentum-integrated dynamic susceptibility is almost
constant with temperature. We suggest that the continuity of higher-energy
magnetic excitations is strong evidence for dynamic stripes in the
high-temperature, disordered phase. We reconsider the nature of the magnetic
dispersion, and we discuss the correspondences between the thermal evolution of
magnetic stripe correlations with other electronic properties of the cuprates.",2007-02-01T20:18:35Z
"Design of Linear-to-Circular Polarization Transformers Made of Long
  Densely Packed Metallic Helices","In this work, we study the realization of realistic polarization transformers
formed by long metallic helices. To this end, we propose a new homogenization
model to characterize the propagation of electromagnetic waves in medium formed
by infinitely long helices. We derive approximate analytical expressions for
the effective permittivity, effective permeability and the magnetoelectric
tensor of the composite material, taking into account the effects of spatial
dispersion. We apply the new homogenization model to characterize novel
linear-to-circular polarization transformers. Our results show that the
metamaterial screen may be designed in such a way that an incoming linearly
polarized wave may be transformed into a circularly polarized transmitted wave,
and that the transmission efficiency of such polarization transformer may be as
high as 95%. The theoretical results are supported by full wave simulations.",2007-01-05T22:57:00Z
Spitzer Search for Mid-IR Excesses Around Five DAZs,"Hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs with metals, so-called DAZs, require
external accretion of material to explain the presence of weak metal line
absorption in their photospheres. The source of this material is currently
uknown, but could come from the interstellar medium, unseen companions, or
relic planetesimals from asteroid belt or Kuiper belt analogues. Mid-infrared
photometry of these white dwarfs provide additional information to solve the
mystery of this accretion and to look for evidence of planetary systems that
have survived post main sequence evolution. We present {\em Spitzer} IRAC
photometry of five DAZs and search for excesses due to unseen companions or
circumstellar dust disks. Three of our targets show unexpected {\em deficits}
in flux, which we tentatively attribute to absorption due to SiO and CO.",2007-03-16T17:23:03Z
"Spin-gapped incoherent metal with preformed pairing in the doped
  antiferromagnetic Mott insulator","We investigate how the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator evolves into the
d-wave BCS superconductor through hole doping. Allowing spin fluctuations in
the strong coupling approach, we find a spin-gapped incoherent metal with
preformed pairing as an intermediate phase between the antiferromagnetic Mott
insulator and d-wave superconductor. This non-Fermi liquid metal is identified
with an infrared stable fixed point in the spin-decomposition gauge theory,
analogous to the spin liquid insulator in the slave-boson gauge theory. We
consider the single particle spectrum and dynamical spin susceptibility in the
anomalous metallic phase, and discuss physical implications.",2007-02-26T07:45:52Z
Peak Effect versus Skating in High Temperature Nanofriction,"The physics of sliding nanofriction at high temperature near the substrate
melting point $\Tmelt$ is so far unexplored. We conducted simulations of hard
tips sliding on a prototype non-melting surface, NaCl(100), revealing in this
regime two distinct and opposite phenomena for plowing and for grazing
friction. We found a frictional drop close to $\Tmelt$ for deep plowing and
wear, but on the contrary a frictional rise for grazing, wearless sliding. For
both phenomena we obtain a fresh microscopic understanding, relating the former
to ``skating'' through a local liquid cloud, the latter to linear response
properties of the free substrate surface. It is argued that both phenomena
should be pursued experimentally, and much more general than the specific NaCl
surface case. Most metals in particular possessing one or more close packed
non-melting surface, such as Pb, Al or Au(111), that should behave quite
similarly.",2007-03-13T09:27:14Z
Fermi-Bose mixture across a Feshbach resonance,"We study a dilute mixture of degenerate bosons and fermions across a Feshbach
resonance of the Fermi-Fermi scattering length $a_F$. This scattering length is
renormalized by the boson-induced interaction between fermions and its value is
crucial to determine the phase diagram of the system. For the mixture in a box
and a positive Bose-Fermi scattering length, we show that there are three
possibilities: a single uniform mixed phase, a purely fermionic phase
coexisting with a mixed phase, and a purely fermionic phase coexisting with a
purely bosonic one. As $1/a_F$ is increased from a negative value to the
Feshbach resonance ($1/a_F=0$) the region of pure separation increases and the
other two regions are strongly reduced. Above the Feshbach resonance
($1/a_F>0$), pairs of Fermi atoms become Bose-condensed molecules. We find that
these molecules are fully spatially separated from the bosonic atoms when
$1/a_F$ exceedes a critical value. For a negative Bose-Fermi scattering length
we deduce the condition for collapse, which coincides with the onset of
dynamical instability of the fully mixed phase. We consider also the mixture in
a harmonic trap and determine the conditions for partial demixing, full
demixing and collapse. The experimental implications of our results are
investigated by analyzing mixtures of $^6$Li--$^{23}$Na and $^{40}$K--$^{87}$Rb
atoms.",2007-01-05T11:21:45Z
"Low-temperature thermodynamics for a flat-band ferromagnet: Rigorous
  versus numerical results","The repulsive Hubbard model on a sawtooth chain exhibits a lowest
single-electron band which is completely dispersionless (flat) for a specific
choice of the hopping parameters. We construct exact many-electron ground
states for electron fillings up to 1/4. We map the low-energy degrees of
freedom of the electron model to a model of classical hard dimers on a chain
and, as a result, obtain the ground-state degeneracy as well as closed-form
expressions for the low-temperature thermodynamic quantities around a
particular value of the chemical potential. We compare our analytical findings
with complementary numerical data. Although we consider a specific model, we
believe that some of our results like a low-temperature peak in the specific
heat are generic for flat-band ferromagnets.",2007-03-12T13:19:06Z
"On the Possibility of Using Semiconductor Nanocolumns for the
  Realization of Quantum Bits","We propose the use of quantum dots formed in a semiconductor nanocolumn for
the realization of charge or spin based quantum bits. The radial carrier
confinement is achieved by employing conformal overgrowth, while multiple
segmented gates are used to control the quantum dot properties. Different
concepts for read-out and control are discussed. Furthermore, we assess which
combinations of core nanowires and shell materials are feasible.",2007-03-20T16:00:47Z
"Prospects of Transition Interface Sampling simulations for the
  theoretical study of zeolite synthesis","The transition interface sampling (TIS) technique allows to overcome large
free energy barriers within reasonable simulation time, which is impossible for
straightforward molecular dynamics. Still, the method does not impose an
artificial driving force, but it surmounts the timescale problem by an
importance sampling of true dynamical pathways. Recently, it was shown that the
efficiency of TIS to calculate reaction rates is less sensitive to the choice
of reaction coordinate than those of the standard free energy based techniques.
This could be an important advantage in complex systems for which a good
reaction coordinate is usually very difficult to find. We explain the
principles of this method and discuss some of the promising applications
related to zeolite formation.",2007-01-15T15:31:56Z
"SU(2) gauge theory of the Hubbard model and application to the honeycomb
  lattice","Motivated by recent experiments on the triangular lattice Mott-Hubbard system
kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3, we develop a general formalism to investigate
quantum spin liquid insulators adjacent to the Mott transition in Hubbard
models. This formalism, dubbed the SU(2) slave-rotor formulation, is an
extension of the SU(2) gauge theory of the Heisenberg model to the case of the
Hubbard model. Furthermore, we propose the honeycomb lattice Hubbard model (at
half-filling) as a candidate for a spin liquid ground state near the Mott
transition; this is an appealing possibility, as this model can be studied via
quantum Monte Carlo simulation without a sign problem. The pseudospin symmetry
of Hubbard models on bipartite lattices turns out to play a crucial role in our
analysis, and we develop our formalism primarily for the case of a bipartite
lattice. We also sketch its development for a general Hubbard model. We develop
a mean-field theory and apply it to the honeycomb lattice. On the insulating
side of the Mott transition, we find an SU(2) algebraic spin liquid (ASL),
described by gapless S = 1/2 Dirac fermions (spinons) coupled to a fluctuating
SU(2) gauge field. We construct a low-energy effective theory describing the
ASL phase, the conducting semimetal phase and the Mott transition between them.
This physics can be detected in numerical simulations via the simultaneous
presence of substantial antiferromagnetic and valence-bond solid correlations.
Our analysis suggests that both a third-neighbor electron hopping, and/or
pseudospin-breaking terms such as a nearest-neighbor density interaction, may
help to stabilize a spin liquid phase.",2007-01-08T16:41:30Z
Complex networks and human language,"This paper introduces how human languages can be studied in light of recent
development of network theories. There are two directions of exploration. One
is to study networks existing in the language system. Various lexical networks
can be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or
syntactic. Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit
small-world and scale-free features. The other direction of exploration is to
study networks of language users (i.e. social networks of people in the
linguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks
also show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by
random or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language
change and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or
regular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures
may affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of
simulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate
the importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for
modeling language change. Four types of social networks are compared, which
exhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which
type of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some
preliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.",2007-01-22T00:45:31Z
"A Methodological Framework for Socio-Cognitive Analyses of Collaborative
  Design of Open Source Software","Open Source Software (OSS) development challenges traditional software
engineering practices. In particular, OSS projects are managed by a large
number of volunteers, working freely on the tasks they choose to undertake. OSS
projects also rarely rely on explicit system-level design, or on project plans
or schedules. Moreover, OSS developers work in arbitrary locations and
collaborate almost exclusively over the Internet, using simple tools such as
email and software code tracking databases (e.g. CVS). All the characteristics
above make OSS development akin to weaving a tapestry of heterogeneous
components. The OSS design process relies on various types of actors: people
with prescribed roles, but also elements coming from a variety of information
spaces (such as email and software code). The objective of our research is to
understand the specific hybrid weaving accomplished by the actors of this
distributed, collective design process. This, in turn, challenges traditional
methodologies used to understand distributed software engineering: OSS
development is simply too ""fibrous"" to lend itself well to analysis under a
single methodological lens. In this paper, we describe the methodological
framework we articulated to analyze collaborative design in the Open Source
world. Our framework focuses on the links between the heterogeneous components
of a project's hybrid network. We combine ethnography, text mining, and
socio-technical network analysis and visualization to understand OSS
development in its totality. This way, we are able to simultaneously consider
the social, technical, and cognitive aspects of OSS development. We describe
our methodology in detail, and discuss its implications for future research on
distributed collective practices.",2007-03-02T13:51:29Z
Graphene as an electronic membrane,"Experiments are finally revealing intricate facts about graphene which go
beyond the ideal picture of relativistic Dirac fermions in pristine two
dimensional (2D) space, two years after its first isolation. While observations
of rippling added another dimension to the richness of the physics of graphene,
scanning single electron transistor images displayed prevalent charge
inhomogeneity. The importance of understanding these non-ideal aspects cannot
be overstated both from the fundamental research interest since graphene is a
unique arena for their interplay, and from the device applications interest
since the quality control is a key to applications. We investigate the membrane
aspect of graphene and its impact on the electronic properties. We show that
curvature generates spatially varying electrochemical potential. Further we
show that the charge inhomogeneity in turn stabilizes ripple formation.",2007-02-23T22:45:30Z
Single quantum dot nanowire LEDs,"We report reproducible fabrication of InP-InAsP nanowire light emitting
diodes in which electron-hole recombination is restricted to a
quantum-dot-sized InAsP section. The nanowire geometry naturally self-aligns
the quantum dot with the n-InP and p-InP ends of the wire, making these devices
promising candidates for electrically-driven quantum optics experiments. We
have investigated the operation of these nano-LEDs with a consistent series of
experiments at room temperature and at 10 K, demonstrating the potential of
this system for single photon applications.",2007-01-06T01:48:16Z
"Magnetic Anisotropy, Spin Pinning and Exchange Constants of (Ga,Mn)As
  films","We present a detailed investigation of exchange-dominated nonpropagating
spin-wave modes in a series of 100 nm Ga$_{1 - x}$Mn$_{x}$As films with Mn
concentrations $x$ ranging from 0.02 to 0.08. The angular and Mn concentration
dependences of spin wave resonance modes have been studied for both as-grown
and annealed samples. Our results indicate that the magnetic anisotropy terms
of Ga$_{1 - x}$Mn$_{x}$As depend on the Mn concentration $x$, but are also
strongly affected by sample growth conditions; moreover, the magnetic
anisotropy of Ga$_{1 - x}$Mn$_{x}$As films is found to be clearly linked to the
Curie temperature. The spin wave resonance spectra consist of a series of well
resolved standing spin-wave modes. The observed mode patterns are consistent
with the Portis volume-inhomogeneity model, in which a spatially nonuniform
anisotropy field acts on the Mn spins. The analysis of these exchange-dominated
spin wave modes, including their angular dependences, allows us to establish
the exchange stiffness constants for Ga$_{1 - x}$Mn$_{x}$As films.",2007-01-29T16:44:32Z
"Frequency noise and intensity noise of next-generation
  gravitational-wave detectors with RF/DC readout schemes","The sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as
Advanced LIGO and LCGT should be limited mostly by quantum noise with an
expected technical progress to reduce seismic noise and thermal noise. Those
detectors will employ the optical configuration of resonant-sideband-extraction
that can be realized with a signal-recycling mirror added to the Fabry-Perot
Michelson interferometer. While this configuration can reduce quantum noise of
the detector, it can possibly increase laser frequency noise and intensity
noise. The analysis of laser noise in the interferometer with the conventional
configuration has been done in several papers, and we shall extend the analysis
to the resonant-sideband-extraction configuration with the radiation pressure
effect included. We shall also refer to laser noise in the case we employ the
so-called DC readout scheme.",2007-01-29T17:36:29Z
"Compression-based methods for nonparametric density estimation, on-line
  prediction, regression and classification for time series","We address the problem of nonparametric estimation of characteristics for
stationary and ergodic time series. We consider finite-alphabet time series and
real-valued ones and the following four problems: i) estimation of the
(limiting) probability (or estimation of the density for real-valued time
series), ii) on-line prediction, iii) regression and iv) classification (or
so-called problems with side information). We show that so-called archivers (or
data compressors) can be used as a tool for solving these problems. In
particular, firstly, it is proven that any so-called universal code (or
universal data compressor) can be used as a basis for constructing
asymptotically optimal methods for the above problems. (By definition, a
universal code can ""compress"" any sequence generated by a stationary and
ergodic source asymptotically till the Shannon entropy of the source.) And,
secondly, we show experimentally that estimates, which are based on practically
used methods of data compression, have a reasonable precision.",2007-01-07T10:57:38Z
"An equation for the description of volume and temperature dependences of
  the dynamics of supercooled liquids and polymer melts","A recently proposed expression to describe the temperature and volume
dependences of the structural (or alpha) relaxation time is discussed. This
equation satisfies the scaling law for the relaxation times, tau = f(TV^g),
where T is temperature, V the specific volume, and g a material-dependent
constant. The expression for the function f is shown to accurately fit
experimental data for several glass-forming liquids and polymers over an
extended range encompassing the dynamic crossover, providing a description of
the dynamics with a minimal number of parameters. The results herein can be
reconciled with previously found correlations of the isochoric fragility with
both the isobaric fragility at atmospheric pressure and the scaling exponent g.",2007-03-20T14:39:41Z
"Theory of vortices in hybridized ballistic/diffusive-band
  superconductors","We study the electronic structure in the vicinity of a vortex in a two-band
superconductor in which the quasiparticle motion is ballistic in one band and
diffusive in the other. This study is based on a model appropriate for such a
case, that we have introduced recently [Phys. Rev. B 73, 220501(R) (2006)]. We
argue that in the two-band superconductor MgB_2 such a case is realised.
Motivated by the experimental findings on MgB_2, we assume that
superconductivity in the diffusive band is ``weak'', i.e., mostly induced. We
examine intriguing features of the order parameter, the current density, and
the vortex core spectrum in the ``strong'' ballistic band under the influence
of hybridization with the ``weak'' diffusive band. Although the order parameter
in the diffusive band is induced, the characteristic length scales in the two
bands differ due to Coulomb interactions. The current density in the vortex
core is dominated by the contribution from the ballistic band, while outside
the core the contribution from the diffusive band can be substantial, or even
dominating. The current density in the diffusive band has strong temperature
dependence, exhibiting the Kramer-Pesch effect when hybridization is strong. A
particularly interesting feature of our model is the possibility of additional
bound states near the gap edge in the ballistic band, that are prominent in the
vortex centre spectra. This contrasts with the single band case, where there is
no gap-edge bound state in the vortex centre. We find the above-mentioned
unique features for parameter values relevant for MgB_2.",2007-02-11T19:55:50Z
"Limitations for the determination of piezoelectric constants with
  piezoresponse force microscopy","At first sight piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) seems an ideal technique
for the determination of piezoelectric coefficients (PCs), thus making use of
its ultra-high vertical resolution (<0.1 pm/V). Christman et al. \cite{Chr98}
first used PFM for this purpose. Their measurements, however, yielded only
reasonable results of unsatisfactory accuracy, amongst others caused by an
incorrect calibration of the setup. In this contribution a reliable calibration
procedure is given followed by a careful analysis of the encounted difficulties
determining PCs with PFM. We point out different approaches for their solution
and expose why, without an extensive effort, those difficulties can not be
circumvented.",2007-03-15T10:18:00Z
Information dynamics: Temporal behavior of uncertainty measures,"We carry out a systematic study of uncertainty measures that are generic to
dynamical processes of varied origins, provided they induce suitable continuous
probability distributions. The major technical tool are the information theory
methods and inequalities satisfied by Fisher and Shannon information measures.
We focus on a compatibility of these inequalities with the prescribed
(deterministic, random or quantum) temporal behavior of pertinent probability
densities.",2007-03-06T10:10:21Z
New Models for the Correlation in Sensor Data,"In this paper, we propose two new models of spatial correlations in sensor
data in a data-gathering sensor network. A particular property of these models
is that if a sensor node knows in \textit{how many} bits it needs to transmit
its data, then it also knows \textit{which} bits of its data it needs to
transmit.",2007-02-06T09:22:25Z
"Collective Modes and Stability of Bose-Fermi Mixtures with a BCS-BEC
  Crossover","We investigate an ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture with a Feshbach resonance
between two hyperfine states of fermions. Using a functional integral method,
we calculate collective modes associated with fermion-pairs and bosons in a
superfluid phase. We derive a stability condition of the mixtures, which is
valid in the entire region of the BCS-BEC crossover. This stability condition,
which smoothly connects the well-known results obtained in both the BCS and BEC
limits, shows that sufficiently strong FB interactions destabilize the
mixtures. In order to investigate the consequence of this instability, we study
the ground state energy of both the uniformly mixed and the phase-separated
states. We find that the FB repulsion induces a phase separation, whereas the
FB attraction should cause a collapse of the mixture. The possibilities for the
experimental observation of such instabilities are also discussed.",2007-02-05T09:04:34Z
"Self-induced density modulations in the free expansion of Bose-Einstein
  condensates","We simulate numerically the free expansion of a repulsive Bose-Einstein
condensate with an initially Gaussian density profile. We find a self-similar
expansion only for weak inter-atomic repulsion. In contrast, for strong
repulsion we observe the spontaneous formation of a shock wave at the surface
followed by a significant depletion inside the cloud. In the expansion,
contrary to the case of a classical viscous gas, the quantum fluid can generate
radial rarefaction density waves with several minima and maxima. These
intriguing nonlinear effects, never observed yet in free-expansion experiments
with ultra-cold alkali-metal atoms, can be detected with the available setups.",2007-01-17T13:31:19Z
Confined coherence in quasi-one-dimensional metals,"We present a functional renormalization group calculation of the effect of
strong interactions on the shape of the Fermi surface of weakly coupled
metallic chains. In the regime where the bare interchain hopping is small, we
show that scattering processes involving large momentum transfers perpendicular
to the chains can completely destroy the warping of the true Fermi surface,
leading to a confined state where the renormalized interchain hopping vanishes
and a coherent motion perpendicular to the chains is impossible.",2007-03-21T08:57:08Z
On the Complexity of a Derivative Chess Problem,"We introduce QUEENS, a derivative chess problem based on the classical
n-queens problem. We prove that QUEENS is NP-complete, with respect to
polynomial-time reductions.",2007-01-08T16:45:55Z
Theory of inelastic scattering from quantum impurities,"We use the framework set up recently to compute non-perturbatively inelastic
scattering from quantum impurities [G. Zar\'and {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 93}, 107204 (2004)] to study the the energy dependence of the single
particle $S$-matrix and the inelastic scattering cross section for a number of
quantum impurity models. We study the case of the spin $S=1/2$ two-channel
Kondo model, the Anderson model, and the usual $S=1/2$ single-channel Kondo
model. We discuss the difference between non-Fermi liquid and Fermi liquid
models and study how a cross-over between the non-Fermi liquid and Fermi liquid
regimes appears in case of channel anisotropy for the $S=1/2$ two-channel Kondo
model. We show that for the most elementary non-Fermi liquid system, the
two-channel Kondo model, half of the scattering remains inelastic even at the
Fermi energy. Details of the derivation of the reduction formulas and a simple
path integral approach to connect the $T$-matrix to local correlation functions
are also presented.",2007-03-12T12:41:50Z
"Energy gap formation in a valence fluctuating compound CeIrSb probed by
  Sb NMR and NQR","Sb-NMR/NQR study has revealed a formation of a pseudogap at the Fermi level
in the density of states in a valence fluctuating compound CeIrSb. The nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature, 1/T_1T has a maximum
around 300 K and decreases significantly as 1/T_1T ~ T^2, followed by a 1/T_1T
= const. relation at low temperature. This temperature dependence of 1/T_1T is
well reproduced by assuming a V-shaped energy gap with a residual density of
states at the Fermi level. The size of energy gap for CeIrSb is estimated to be
about 350 K, which is by one order of magnitude larger than those for the
isostructural Kondo semiconductors CeRhSb and CeNiSn. Despite the large
difference in the size of energy gap, CeIrSb, CeRhSb and CeNiSn are indicated
to be classified into the same group revealing a V-shaped gap due to c-f
hybridization. The temperature dependence of the Knight shift measured in a
high magnetic field agrees with the formation of this pseudogap.",2007-01-24T09:10:32Z
Phase Transition in Liquid Drop Fragmentation,"A liquid droplet is fragmented by a sudden pressurized-gas blow, and the
resulting droplets, adhered to the window of a flatbed scanner, are counted and
sized by computerized means. The use of a scanner plus image recognition
software enables us to automatically count and size up to tens of thousands of
tiny droplets with a smallest detectable volume of approximately 0.02 nl. Upon
varying the gas pressure, a critical value is found where the size-distribution
becomes a pure power-law, a fact that is indicative of a phase transition. Away
from this transition, the resulting size distributions are well described by
Fisher's model at coexistence. It is found that the sign of the surface
correction term changes sign, and the apparent power-law exponent tau has a
steep minimum, at criticality, as previously reported in Nuclear
Multifragmentation studies [1,2]. We argue that the observed transition is not
percolative, and introduce the concept of dominance in order to characterize
it. The dominance probability is found to go to zero sharply at the transition.
Simple arguments suggest that the correlation length exponent is nu=1/2. The
sizes of the largest and average fragments, on the other hand, do not go to
zero but behave in a way that appears to be consistent with recent predictions
of Ashurst and Holian [3,4].",2007-03-26T22:56:24Z
Clustering and Sharing Incentives in BitTorrent Systems,"Peer-to-peer protocols play an increasingly instrumental role in Internet
content distribution. It is therefore important to gain a complete
understanding of how these protocols behave in practice and how their operating
parameters affect overall system performance. This paper presents the first
detailed experimental investigation of the peer selection strategy in the
popular BitTorrent protocol. By observing more than 40 nodes in instrumented
private torrents, we validate three protocol properties that, though believed
to hold, have not been previously demonstrated experimentally: the clustering
of similar-bandwidth peers, the effectiveness of BitTorrent's sharing
incentives, and the peers' high uplink utilization. In addition, we observe
that BitTorrent's modified choking algorithm in seed state provides uniform
service to all peers, and that an underprovisioned initial seed leads to
absence of peer clustering and less effective sharing incentives. Based on our
results, we provide guidelines for seed provisioning by content providers, and
discuss a tracker protocol extension that addresses an identified limitation of
the protocol.",2007-03-22T08:16:02Z
Tunable quantum dots in bilayer graphene,"We demonstrate theoretically that quantum dots in bilayers of graphene can be
realized. A position-dependent doping breaks the equivalence between the upper
and lower layer and lifts the degeneracy of the positive and negative momentum
states of the dot. Numerical results show the simultaneous presence of electron
and hole confined states for certain doping profiles and a remarkable angular
momentum dependence of the quantum dot spectrum which is in sharp contrast with
that for conventional semiconductor quantum dots. We predict that the optical
spectrum will consist of a series of non-equidistant peaks.",2007-03-07T22:37:15Z
"Dynamic Lattice Distortions in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: A microscopic study by
  perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) spectroscopy","Applying time differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) spectroscopy
and \emph{ab initio} calculations, we have investigated possible lattice
instabilities in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ by studying the electric quadrupole
interaction of a $^{111}$Cd probe at the Ru site. We find evidence for a
dynamic lattice distortion, revealed from the observations of: (i) a rapidly
fluctuating electric-field gradient (EFG) tensor of which the main component
decreases with decreasing temperature, and (ii) a monotonic increase of the EFG
asymmetry ($\eta$) below 300 K. We argue that the observed dynamic lattice
distortion is caused by strong spin fluctuations associated with the inherent
magnetic instability of Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$.",2007-01-04T06:27:42Z
"Anomalous magnetic phase in an undistorted pyrochlore oxide Cd2Os2O7
  induced by geometrical frustration","We report on the muon spin rotation/relaxation study of a pyrochlore oxide,
Cd2Os2O7, which exhibits a metal-insulator (MI) transition at T_{MI}~225 K
without structural phase transition. It reveals strong spin fluctuation
(>10^8/s) below the MI transition, suggesting a predominant role of geometrical
spin frustration amongst Os^{5+} ions. Meanwhile, upon further cooling, a
static spin density wave discontinuously develops below T_{SDW}~150 K. These
observations strongly suggest the occurrence of an anomalous magnetic
transition and associated change in the local spin dynamics in undistorted
pyrochlore antiferromagnet.",2007-02-07T08:24:56Z
Manifestation of a gap due to the exchange energy in a spinor condensate,"We investigate the dynamic response of population transfer between two
components of a finite temperature spinor Bose condensed gas to a
time-dependent coupling potential. Comparison between results obtained in the
Bogoliubov-Popov approximation (BPA) and in the generalized random phase
approximation (GRPA) shows noticeable discrepancies. In particular, the
inter-component current response function calculated in the GRPA displays a
gapped spectrum due to the exchange interaction energy whereas the
corresponding density response function is gapless. We argue that the GRPA is
superior since, contrary to the BPA, it preserves the SU(2) symmetry and the
f-sum rule associated to the spinor gas. In order to validate the
approximation, we propose an experimental setup that allows the observation of
the predicted gap.",2007-03-23T11:34:30Z
"Shear zones and wall slip in the capillary flow of concentrated
  colloidal suspensions","We image the flow of a nearly random close packed, hard-sphere colloidal
suspension (a `paste') in a square capillary using confocal microscopy. The
flow consists of a `plug' in the center while shear occurs localized adjacent
to the channel walls, reminiscent of yield-stress fluid behavior. However, the
observed scaling of the velocity profiles with the flow rate strongly contrasts
yield-stress fluid predictions. Instead, the velocity profiles can be captured
by a theory of stress fluctuations originally developed for chute flow of dry
granular media. We verified this behavior both for smooth and rough boundary
conditions.",2007-02-27T18:54:27Z
"Scaling Behavior and Variable Hopping Conductivity in the Quantum Hall
  Plateau Transition","We have measured the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity
$% \rho_{xx}$ of a two-dimensional electron system in the regime of the quantum
Hall plateau transition. We extracted the quantitative form of scaling function
for $\rho_{xx}$ and compared it with the results of ordinary scaling theory and
variable range hopping based theory. We find that the two alternative
theoretically proposed scaling functions are valid in different regions.",2007-03-27T12:22:38Z
Space Representation of Stochastic Processes with Delay,"We show that a time series $x_t$ evolving by a non-local update rule $x_t = f
(x_{t-n},x_{t-k})$ with two different delays $k<n$ can be mapped onto a local
process in two dimensions with special time-delayed boundary conditions
provided that $n$ and $k$ are coprime. For certain stochastic update rules
exhibiting a non-equilibrium phase transition this mapping implies that the
critical behavior does not depend on the short delay $k$. In these cases, the
autocorrelation function of the time series is related to the critical
properties of directed percolation.",2007-03-22T14:25:29Z
"Quantum disordering of the 111 state and the compressible-incompressible
  transition in quantum Hall bilayer systems","We systematically discuss properties of quantum disordered states of the
quantum Hall bilayer at \nu_T = 1. For one of them, so-called vortex metal
state, we find ODLRO (off-diagonal long-range order) of algebraic kind, and
derive its transport properties. It is shown that this state is relevant for
the explanation of the ""imperfect"" superfluid behavior, and persistent
intercorrelations, for large distances between layers, that were found in
experiments.",2007-02-02T09:23:06Z
HI imaging of galaxies in X-ray bright groups,"Environment plays an important role in the evolution of the gas contents of
galaxies. Gas deficiency of cluster spirals and the role of the hot
intracluster medium (ICM) in stripping gas from these galaxies is a well
studied subject. Loose groups with diffuse X-ray emmision from the intragroup
medium (IGM) offer an intermediate environment between clusters and groups
without a hot IGM. These X-ray bright groups have smaller velocity dispersion
and lower temperature than clusters, but higher IGM density than loose groups
without diffuse X-ray emission. A single dish comparative study of loose groups
with and without diffuse X-ray emission from the IGM, showed that the galaxies
in X-ray bright groups have lost more gas on average than the galaxies in non
X-ray bright groups. In this paper we present GMRT HI observations of 13
galaxies from 4 X-ray bright groups: NGC5044, NGC720, NGC1550 and IC1459. The
aim of this work is to study the morphology of HI in these galaxies and to see
if the hot IGM has in any way affected their HI content or distribution. In
addition to disturbed HI morphology, we find that most galaxies have shrunken
HI disks compared to the field spirals. This indicates that IGM assisted
stripping processes like ram pressure may have stripped gas from the outer
edges of the galaxies.",2007-03-26T06:20:19Z
"Comment on ``Spin-glass transition of the three-dimensional Heisenberg
  spin glass''","Campos et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 (2006) 217204] claim that in the 3d

Chiral spin pairing in helical magnets,"The Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian for incommensurate frustrated classical spin
systems is analyzed. The coupling to phonons through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction and/or the four-spin exchange interaction of the Coulomb origin
under the egde-sharing network of magnetic and ligand ions drive chiral spin
piarings, introducing two successive second-order phase transitions upon
cooling. First, a vector spin-chiral order appears with an either parity,
leaving an O(2) chiral spin liquid. Then, the O(2) symmetry is broken by the
spin ordering into a helical magnetic state. Possible candidate materials are
also discussed.",2007-03-02T14:04:46Z
"Magnetic Anisotropy, Spin Pinning and Exchange Constants of (Ga,Mn)As
  films","We present a detailed investigation of exchange-dominated nonpropagating
spin-wave modes in a series of 100 nm Ga$_{1 - x}$Mn$_{x}$As films with Mn
concentrations $x$ ranging from 0.02 to 0.08. The angular and Mn concentration
dependences of spin wave resonance modes have been studied for both as-grown
and annealed samples. Our results indicate that the magnetic anisotropy terms
of Ga$_{1 - x}$Mn$_{x}$As depend on the Mn concentration $x$, but are also
strongly affected by sample growth conditions; moreover, the magnetic
anisotropy of Ga$_{1 - x}$Mn$_{x}$As films is found to be clearly linked to the
Curie temperature. The spin wave resonance spectra consist of a series of well
resolved standing spin-wave modes. The observed mode patterns are consistent
with the Portis volume-inhomogeneity model, in which a spatially nonuniform
anisotropy field acts on the Mn spins. The analysis of these exchange-dominated
spin wave modes, including their angular dependences, allows us to establish
the exchange stiffness constants for Ga$_{1 - x}$Mn$_{x}$As films.",2007-01-29T16:44:32Z
"Automated selection and characterization of emission-line sources in ACS
  WFC grism data","We present complimentary techniques to find emission-line targets and measure
their properties in a semi-automated fashion from grism observations obtained
with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The
first technique is to find all likely sources in a direct image, extract their
spectra and search them for emission lines. The second method is to look for
emission-line sources as compact structures in an unsharp masked version of the
grism image. Using these methods we identify 46 emission-line targets in the
Hubble Deep Field North using a modest (3 orbit) expenditure of HST observing
time. Grism spectroscopy is a powerful tool for efficiently identifying
interesting low luminosity, moderate redshift emission-line field galaxies. The
sources found here have a median i band flux 1.5 mag fainter than the
spectroscopic redshift catalog of Cohen et al. They have redshift z <= 1.42,
high equivalent widths (typically EW > 100{\AA}), and are usually less luminous
than the characteristic luminosity at the same redshift. The chief obstacle in
interpreting the results is line identification, since the majority of sources
have a single emission line and the spectral resolution is low. Photometric
redshifts are useful for providing a first guess redshift. However, even at the
depth of the state-of-the-art data used here, photometric errors can result in
uncertainties in line identifications, especially for sources with i > ~24.5
ABmag. Reliable line identification for the faintest emission-line galaxies
requires additional ground-based spectroscopy for confirmation. Of particular
concern are the faint high EW [OII] emitters which could represent a strongly
evolving galaxy population if the possibility that they are mis-identified
lower redshift interlopers can be ruled out. (Slightly abridged)",2007-03-12T22:31:23Z
"Burial of the polar magnetic field of an accreting neutron star. II.
  Hydromagnetic stability of axisymmetric equilibria","The theory of polar magnetic burial in accreting neutron stars predicts that
a mountain of accreted material accumulates at the magnetic poles of the star,
and that, as the mountain spreads equatorward, it is confined by, and
compresses, the equatorial magnetic field. Here, we extend previous,
axisymmetric, Grad-Shafranov calculations of the hydromagnetic structure of a
magnetic mountain up to accreted masses as high as $\Ma = 6\times
10^{-4}\Msun$, by importing the output from previous calculations (which were
limited by numerical problems and the formation of closed bubbles to $\Ma <
10^{-4}\Msun$) into the time-dependent, ideal-magnetohydrodynamic code ZEUS-3D
and loading additional mass onto the star dynamically. The rise of buoyant
magnetic bubbles through the accreted layer is observed in these experiments.
We also investigate the stability of the resulting hydromagnetic equilibria by
perturbing them in ZEUS-3D. Surprisingly, it is observed that the equilibria
are marginally stable for all $\Ma\leq 6\times 10^{-4}\Msun$; the mountain
oscillates persistently when perturbed, in a combination of Alfv\'en and

disrupted (apart from a transient Parker instability initially, which expels $<
1 %$ of the mass and magnetic flux).",2007-03-09T12:33:12Z
"Dissipative Landau-Zener transitions of a qubit: bath-specific and
  universal behavior","We study Landau-Zener transitions in a qubit coupled to a bath at zero
temperature. A general formula is derived that is applicable to models with a
non-degenerate ground state. We calculate exact transition probabilities for a
qubit coupled to either a bosonic or a spin bath. The nature of the baths and
the qubit-bath coupling is reflected in the transition probabilities. For
diagonal coupling, when the bath causes energy fluctuations of the diabatic
qubit states but no transitions between them, the transition probability
coincides with the standard LZ probability of an isolated qubit. This result is
universal as it does not depend on the specific type of bath. For pure
off-diagonal coupling, by contrast, the tunneling probability is sensitive to
the coupling strength. We discuss the relevance of our results for experiments
on molecular nanomagnets, in circuit QED, and for the fast-pulse readout of
superconducting phase qubits.",2007-03-23T02:27:44Z

Finding large and small dense subgraphs,"We consider two optimization problems related to finding dense subgraphs. The
densest at-least-k-subgraph problem (DalkS) is to find an induced subgraph of
highest average degree among all subgraphs with at least k vertices, and the
densest at-most-k-subgraph problem (DamkS) is defined similarly. These problems
are related to the well-known densest k-subgraph problem (DkS), which is to
find the densest subgraph on exactly k vertices. We show that DalkS can be
approximated efficiently, while DamkS is nearly as hard to approximate as the
densest k-subgraph problem.",2007-02-05T19:29:38Z
Do Mergers Spin up Dark Matter Halos?,"We use a large cosmological N-body simulation to study the origin of possible
correlations between the merging history and spin of cold dark matter halos. In
particular, we examine claims that remnants of major mergers tend to have
higher-than-average spins, and find that the effect is driven largely by
unrelaxed systems: equilibrium dark matter halos show no significant
correlation between spin and merger history. Out-of-equilibrium halos have, on
average, higher spins than relaxed systems, suggesting that the virialization
process leads to a net decrease in the value of the spin parameter. We find
that this decrease is driven by the internal redistribution of mass and angular
momentum that occurs during virialization, a process that is especially
efficient during major mergers, when high angular momentum material is pushed
beyond the virial radius of the remnant. Since such redistribution likely
affects the angular momentum of baryons and dark matter unevenly, our findings
question the common practice of identifying the specific angular momentum
content of a halo with that of its embedded luminous component. Further work is
needed to elucidate the true relation between the angular momentum content of
baryons and dark matter in galaxy systems assembled hierarchically.",2007-03-08T21:35:25Z
"Ab-initio design of half-metallic fully-compensated ferrimagnets: the
  case of Cr$_2$MnZ (Z= P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds","Electronic structure calculations from first-principles are employed to
design some new half-metallic fully-compensated ferrimagnets (or as they are
widely known half-metallic antiferromagnets) susceptible of finding
applications in spintronics. Cr$_2$MnZ (Z= P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds have 24
valence electrons per unit cell and calculations show that their total spin
moment is approximately zero for a wide range of lattice constants in agreement
with the Slater-Pauling behavior for ideal half-metals. Simultaneously, the
spin magnetic moments of Cr and Mn atoms are antiparallel and the compounds are
ferrimagnets. Mean-field approximation is employed to estimate their Curie
temperature, which exceeds room temperature for the alloy with Sb. Our findings
suggest that Cr$_2$MnSb is the compound of choice for further experimental
investigations. Contrary to the alloys mentioned above half-metallic
antiferromagnetism is unstable in the case of the Cr$_2$FeZ (Z= Si, Ge, Sn)
alloys.",2007-03-02T20:48:37Z
Frequency shift of optical phonons in doped graphene layers,"We use first-principles density-functional calculations to determine the
frequency shift of the A$'_1$-${\bf K}$ phonon (Raman D band) in monolayer
graphene, as a function of the charge doping. A detailed DFT study on the
electron-phonon coupling and the phonon line width of E$_{2g}$-${\bm \Gamma}$
and A$'_1$-${\bf K}$ phonons are also performed for graphene multi-layers.
Furthermore, we explain the experimentally observed '1/(Number of Layers)'

"Current-induced spin polarization and the spin Hall effect: a
  quasiclassical approach","The quasiclassical Green function formalism is used to describe charge and

boundaries is discussed in the framework of spin diffusion equations.",2007-01-25T18:46:02Z
Effect of Polarized Current on the Magnetic State of Antiferromagnet,"We provide evidence for the effects of spin polarized current on a
nanofabricated antiferromagnet incorporated into a spin-valve structure.
Signatures of current-induced effects include bipolar steps in differential
resistance, current-induced changes of exchange bias correlated with these
steps, and deviations from the statistics expected for thermally activated
switching of spin valves. We explain our observations by a combination of spin
torque exerted on the interfacial antiferromagnetic moments, and
electron-magnon scattering in antiferromagnet.",2007-03-12T01:38:09Z
"Optical Study of the Free Carrier Response of LaTiO3/SrTiO3
  Superlattices","We used infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry to investigate the electronic
properties of LaTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices (SLs). Our results indicated that,
independent of the SL periodicity and individual layer-thickness, the SLs
exhibited a Drude metallic response with sheet carrier density per interface
~3x10^14 cm^-2. This is probably due to the leakage of d-electrons at
interfaces from the Mott insulator LaTiO3 to the band insulator SrTiO3. We
observed a carrier relaxation time ~ 35 fs and mobility ~ 35 cm^2V^-1s^-1 at 10
K, and an unusual temperature dependence of carrier density that was attributed
to the dielectric screening of quantum paraelectric SrTiO3.",2007-03-15T15:59:37Z
Natural Dark Energy,"It is now well accepted that both Dark Matter and Dark Energy are required in
any successful cosmological model. Although there is ample evidence that both
Dark components are necessary, the conventional theories make no prediction for
the contributions from each of them. Moreover, there is usually no intrinsic
relationship between the two components, and no understanding of the nature of
the mysteries of the Dark Sector. Here we suggest that if the Dark Side is so
seductive then we should not be restricted to just 2 components. We further
suggest that the most natural model has 5 distinct forms of Dark Energy in
addition to the usual Dark Matter, each contributing precisely equally to the
cosmic energy density budget.",2007-03-30T18:48:13Z
"Signatures of retroreflection and induced triplet electron-hole
  correlations in ferromagnet/s-wave superconductor structures","We present a theoretical study of a ferromagnet/s-wave superconductor
junction to investigate the signatures of induced triplet correlations in the
system. We apply the extended BTK-formalism and allow for an arbitrary
magnetization strength/direction of the ferromagnet, a spin-active barrier,
Fermi-vector mismatch, and different effective masses in the two systems. It is
found that the phase associated with the $xy$-components of the magnetization
in the ferromagnet couples with the superconducting phase and induces
spin-triplet pairing correlations in the superconductor, if the tunneling
barrier acts as a spin-filter. This feature leads to an induced spin-triplet
pairing correlation in the ferromagnet, along with a spin-triplet electron-hole
coherence due to an interplay between the ferromagnetic and superconducting
phase. As our main result, we investigate the experimental signatures of
retrorelection, manifested in the tunneling conductance of a ferromagnet/s-wave
superconductor junction with a spin-active interface.",2007-03-15T08:28:54Z
"Use and Abuse of a Fractional Fokker-Planck Dynamics for Time-Dependent
  Driving","We investigate a subdiffusive, fractional Fokker-Planck dynamics occurring in
time-varying potential landscapes and thereby disclose the failure of the
fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE) in its commonly used form when
generalized in an {\it ad hoc} manner to time-dependent forces. A modified FFPE
(MFFPE) is rigorously derived, being valid for a family of dichotomously
alternating force-fields. This MFFPE is numerically validated for a rectangular
time-dependent force with zero average bias. For this case subdiffusion is
shown to become enhanced as compared to the force free case. We question,
however, the existence of any physically valid FFPE for arbitrary varying
time-dependent fields that differ from this dichotomous varying family.",2007-03-15T17:27:04Z
Single-site Anderson Model. I Diagrammatic theory,"The diagrammatic theory is proposed for the strongly correlated impurity
Anderson model. The strongly correlated impurity electrons are hybridized with
free conduction electrons. For this system the new diagrammatic approach is
formulated. The linked cluster theorem for vacuum diagrams is proved and the
Dyson type equations for electron propagators of both electron subsystems are
established, together with such equations for mixed propagators. The
approximations based on the summing the infinite series of diagrams are
proposed, which close the system of equations and permit the investigation of
the system's properties.",2007-01-13T15:08:05Z
Spin transverse force and quantum transverse transport,"We present a brief review on spin transverse force, which exerts on the spin
as the electron is moving in an electric field. This force, analogue to the
Lorentz force on electron charge, is perpendicular to the electric field and
spin current carried by the electron. The force stems from the spin-orbit
coupling of electrons as a relativistic quantum effect, and could be used to
understand the Zitterbewegung of electron wave packet and the quantum
transverse transport of electron in a heuristic way.",2007-03-08T04:22:10Z
Anyons in a weakly interacting system,"We describe a theoretical proposal for a system whose excitations are anyons
with the exchange phase pi/4 and charge -e/2, but, remarkably, can be built by
filling a set of single-particle states of essentially noninteracting
electrons. The system consists of an artificially structured type-II
superconducting film adjacent to a 2D electron gas in the integer quantum Hall
regime with unit filling fraction. The proposal rests on the observation that a
vacancy in an otherwise periodic vortex lattice in the superconductor creates a
bound state in the 2DEG with total charge -e/2. A composite of this
fractionally charged hole and the missing flux due to the vacancy behaves as an
anyon. The proposed setup allows for manipulation of these anyons and could
prove useful in various schemes for fault-tolerant topological quantum
computation.",2007-02-28T21:03:44Z

Absorption and desorption currents in polystyrene doped with DR1,"Isothermal polarization and depolarization currents in polystyrene doped with
DR1 chromophore molecules have been measured and analyzed in order to study the
electrical relaxation of the poled order in this guest-host system. It has been
shown that the superposition principle is applicable to the polymer system
under study at temperatures lower than the glass transition temperature
indicating that the doped polystyrene can be considered electrically as a
linear system with a negligible electric conductivity. It has been found that
the response function is not the exponential one and characterized by a broad
distribution of relaxation times. By comparing isothermal absorption and
desorption currents, the practical information was obtained on the best poling
conditions for getting high and stable residual polarization.",2007-03-08T17:13:27Z
"Spin moment over 10-300 K and delocalization of magnetic electrons above
  the Verwey transition in magnetite","In order to probe the magnetic ground state, we have carried out temperature
dependent magnetic Compton scattering experiments on an oriented single crystal
of magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$), together with the corresponding first-principles
band theory computations to gain insight into the measurements. An accurate
value of the magnetic moment $\mu_S$ associated with unpaired spins is obtained
directly over the temperature range of 10-300K. $\mu_S$ is found to be
non-integral and to display an anomalous behavior with the direction of the
external magnetic field near the Verwey transition. These results reveal how
the magnetic properties enter the Verwey energy scale via spin-orbit coupling
and the geometrical frustration of the spinel structure, even though the Curie
temperature of magnetite is in excess of 800 K. The anisotropy of the magnetic
Compton profiles increases through the Verwey temperature $T_v$ and indicates
that magnetic electrons in the ground state of magnetite become delocalized on
Fe B-sites above $T_v$.",2007-03-12T19:45:19Z
Fluctuation theorems for stochastic dynamics,"Fluctuation theorems make use of time reversal to make predictions about
entropy production in many-body systems far from thermal equilibrium. Here we
review the wide variety of distinct, but interconnected, relations that have
been derived and investigated theoretically and experimentally. Significantly,
we demonstrate, in the context of Markovian stochastic dynamics, how these
different fluctuation theorems arise from a simple fundamental time-reversal
symmetry of a certain class of observables. Appealing to the notion of Gibbs
entropy allows for a microscopic definition of entropy production in terms of
these observables. We work with the master equation approach, which leads to a
mathematically straightforward proof and provides direct insight into the
probabilistic meaning of the quantities involved. Finally, we point to some
experiments that elucidate the practical significance of fluctuation relations.",2007-02-23T16:02:00Z
Multicomponent fluid of hard spheres near a wall,"The rational function approximation method, density functional theory, and
NVT Monte Carlo simulation are used to obtain the density profiles of
multicomponent hard-sphere mixtures near a planar hard wall. Binary mixtures
with a size ratio 1:3 in which both components occupy a similar volume are
specifically examined. The results indicate that the present version of density
functional theory yields an excellent overall performance. A reasonably
accurate behavior of the rational function approximation method is also
observed, except in the vicinity of the first minimum, where it may even
predict unphysical negative values.",2007-02-12T17:31:10Z
Unusual liquid state of hard-core bosons on the pyrochlore lattice,"We study the physics of hard-core bosons with unfrustrated hopping (t) and
nearest-neighbor repulsion (V) on the three dimensional pyrochlore lattice. At
half-filling, we demonstrate that the small V/t superfluid state eventually
becomes unstable at large enough V/t to an unusual insulating state which
displays no broken lattice translation symmetry. Equal time and static density
correlators in this insulator are well described by a mapping to electric field
correlators in the Coulomb phase of a U(1) lattice gauge theory, allowing us to
identify this insulator with a U(1) fractionalized Mott-insulating state. The
possibility of observing this phase in suitably designed atom-trap experiments
with ultracold atoms is also discussed, as are specific experimental
signatures.",2007-02-01T21:04:40Z
River scaling analysis and the BHP universality hypothesis,"The XY-model shows in two dimensions in the strong coupling regime a
universal distribution, named BHP, which in turn also describes other models of
criticality and self-organized criticality and even describes natural data as
river level and flow. We start by analysing the two dimensional XY-model and
calculate the BHP probability density function. The results obtained for
several dissimilar phenomenons which includes the deseasonalised Danube height
data raised the universality hypothesis for rivers. This hypothesis is tested
for the Iberian river Douro. Deviations from the BHP are found especially for
medium and small runoffs. For regimes closer to the natural flow the
fluctuations tend to follow the universal curve again.",2007-03-02T16:25:08Z
"Kinematic Substructures in the Coma Cluster Core as traced by
  Intracluster Planetary Nebulae","The Coma cluster is the richest and most compact of the nearby clusters, yet
there is growing evidence that its formation is still on-going. A sensitive
probe of this evolution is the dynamics of intracluster stars, which are
unbound from galaxies while the cluster forms, according to cosmological
simulations. With a new multi-slit imaging spectroscopy technique pioneered at
the 8.2 m Subaru telescope and FOCAS, we can now detect and measure the
line-of-sight velocities of the intracluster planetary nebulae which are
associated with the diffuse stellar population of stars, at 100 Mpc distance.
We detect significant velocity substructures within a 6 arcmin diameter field,
centred on the Coma X-ray cluster emission. One substructure ispresent at ~5000
km/s, probably from infall of a galaxy group, while the main intracluster
stellar component moves at ~ 6500 km/s. Hence the ICPNs associated with the
diffuse light at the position of the MSIS field are not bound to the nearby cD
galaxy NGC 4874, whose radial velocity is ~ 700 km/s greater.",2007-03-23T10:22:50Z
"Non equilibrium steady states: fluctuations and large deviations of the
  density and of the current","These lecture notes give a short review of methods such as the matrix ansatz,
the additivity principle or the macroscopic fluctuation theory, developed
recently in the theory of non-equilibrium phenomena. They show how these
methods allow to calculate the fluctuations and large deviations of the density
and of the current in non-equilibrium steady states of systems like exclusion
processes. The properties of these fluctuations and large deviation functions
in non-equilibrium steady states (for example non-Gaussian fluctuations of
density or non-convexity of the large deviation function which generalizes the
notion of free energy) are compared with those of systems at equilibrium.",2007-03-28T17:35:05Z
"Classical to Quantum Transition of a Driven Nonlinear Nanomechanical
  Resonator","We seek the first indications that a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) is
entering the quantum domain as its mass and temperature are decreased. We find
them by studying the transition from classical to quantum behavior of a driven
nonlinear Duffing resonator. Numerical solutions of the equations of motion,
operating in the bistable regime of the resonator, demonstrate that the quantum
Wigner function gradually deviates from the corresponding classical phase-space
probability density. These clear differences that develop due to nonlinearity
can serve as experimental evidence, in the near future, that NEMS resonators
are entering the quantum domain.",2007-02-09T23:54:36Z
"Self-consistent analytical solution of a problem of charge-carrier
  injection at a conductor/insulator interface","We present a closed description of the charge carrier injection process from
a conductor into an insulator. Common injection models are based on single
electron descriptions, being problematic especially once the amount of
charge-carriers injected is large. Accordingly, we developed a model, which
incorporates space charge effects in the description of the injection process.
The challenge of this task is the problem of self-consistency. The amount of
charge-carriers injected per unit time strongly depends on the energy barrier
emerging at the contact, while at the same time the electrostatic potential
generated by the injected charge- carriers modifies the height of this
injection barrier itself. In our model, self-consistency is obtained by
assuming continuity of the electric displacement and the electrochemical
potential all over the conductor/insulator system. The conductor and the
insulator are properly taken into account by means of their respective density
of state distributions. The electric field distributions are obtained in a
closed analytical form and the resulting current-voltage characteristics show
that the theory embraces injection-limited as well as bulk-limited
charge-carrier transport. Analytical approximations of these limits are given,
revealing physical mechanisms responsible for the particular current-voltage
behavior. In addition, the model exhibits the crossover between the two
limiting cases and determines the validity of respective approximations. The
consequences resulting from our exactly solvable model are discussed on the
basis of a simplified indium tin oxide/organic semiconductor system.",2007-03-27T07:55:31Z
"Weak binding between two aromatic rings: feeling the van der Waals
  attraction by quantum Monte Carlo methods","We report a systematic study of the weak chemical bond between two benzene
molecules. We first show that it is possible to obtain a very good description
of the C_2 dimer and the benzene molecule, by using pseudopotentials for the
chemically inert 1s electrons, and a resonating valence bond wave function as a
variational ansatz, expanded on a relatively small Gaussian basis set. We
employ an improved version of the stochastic reconfiguration technique to
optimize the many-body wave function, which is the starting point for highly
accurate simulations based on the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo
(LRDMC) method. This projection technique provides a rigorous variational upper
bound for the total energy, even in the presence of pseudopotentials, and
allows to improve systematically the accuracy of the trial wave function, which
already yields a large fraction of the dynamical and non-dynamical electron
correlation. We show that the energy dispersion of two benzene molecules in the
parallel displaced geometry is significantly deeper than the face-to-face
configuration. However, contrary to previous studies based on post Hartree-Fock
methods, the binding energy remains weak (~ 2 kcal/mol) also in this geometry,
and its value is in agreement with the most accurate and recent experimental
findings.",2007-02-15T02:08:23Z
Rashba quantum wire: exact solution and ballistic transport,"The effect of Rashba spin-orbit interaction in quantum wires with hard-wall
boundaries is discussed. The exact wave function and eigenvalue equation are
worked out pointing out the mixing between the spin and spatial parts. The
spectral properties are also studied within the perturbation theory with
respect to the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and diagonalization
procedure. A comparison is done with the results of a simple model, the
two-band model, that takes account only of the first two sub-bands of the wire.
Finally, the transport properties within the ballistic regime are analytically
calculated for the two-band model and through a tight-binding Green function
for the entire system. Single and double interfaces separating regions with
different strengths of spin-orbit interaction are analyzed injecting carriers
into the first and the second sub-band. It is shown that in the case of a
single interface the spin polarization in the Rashba region is different from
zero, and in the case of two interfaces the spin polarization shows
oscillations due to spin selective bound states.",2007-01-21T20:11:53Z
"The magneto-optical Barnett effect and spin momentum
  transfer:Magnetization switching by circularly polarized light","The interaction of polarized light with a spin in the presence of dissipation
is shown to be equivalent to a spin transfer process that can cause switching.
In plasmas, the spin transfer is dominated by a spin-spin exchange term while
at lower energy densities it is dominated by an optical Barnett-like effect.
This latter effect is used in conjunction with optical phonons to predict
femtosecond magnetization reversal believed to be recently measured in GdCoFe
thin films. Conventional approaches based on the Bloch and the Landau-Lifshitz
equations do not reproduce this ultrafast switching.",2007-02-25T04:01:34Z
"Efficiency of mass transfer in massive close binaries, Tests from
  double-lined eclipsing binaries in the SMC","One of the major uncertainties in close binary evolution is the efficiency of
mass transfer beta: the fraction of transferred mass that is accreted by a
secondary star. We attempt to constrain the mass-transfer efficiency for
short-period massive binaries undergoing case A mass transfer.
  We present a grid of about 20,000 detailed binary evolution tracks with
primary masses 3.5-35 Msun, orbital periods 1-5 days at a metallicity Z=0.004,
assuming both conservative and non-conservative mass transfer. We perform a
systematic comparison, using least-squares fitting, of the computed models with
a sample of 50 double-lined eclipsing binaries in the Small Magellanic Cloud,
for which fundamental stellar parameters have been determined. About 60% of the
systems are currently undergoing slow mass transfer.
  In general we find good agreement between our models and the observed
detached systems. However, for many of the semi-detached systems the observed
temperature ratio is more extreme than our models predict. For the 17
semi-detached systems that we are able to match, we find a large spread in the
best fitting mass-transfer efficiency; no single value of beta can explain all
systems. We find a hint that initially wider systems tend to fit better to less
conservative models. We show the need for more accurate temperature
determinations and we find that determinations of surface abundances of
nitrogen and carbon can potentially constrain the mass-transfer efficiency
further.",2007-03-19T14:27:52Z
"Dynamics of Phononic Dissipation at the Atomic Scale: Dependence on
  Internal Degrees of Freedom","Dynamics of dissipation of a local phonon distribution to the substrate is a
key issue in friction between sliding surfaces as well as in boundary
lubrication. We consider a model system consisting of an excited nano-particle
which is weakly coupled with a substrate. Using three different methods we
solve the dynamics of energy dissipation for different types of coupling
between the nano-particle and the substrate, where different types of
dimensionality and phonon densities of states were also considered for the
substrate. In this paper, we present our analysis of transient properties of
energy dissipation via phonon discharge in the microscopic level towards the
substrate. Our theoretical analysis can be extended to treat realistic
lubricant molecules or asperities, and also substrates with more complex
densities of states. We found that the decay rate of the nano-particle phonons
increases as the square of the interaction constant in the harmonic
approximation.",2007-03-01T13:14:34Z
Selective heating of the ferroelectric film soft mode phonons,"Results of the experimental study of the electromagnetic pumping of frequency
0.3 THz upon the soft mode phonons in the (Ba, Sr)TiO3 film are presented. Some
features of the phonon state are revealed using the capacitor thermometer and
the thermocouple. The soft mode phonon overheating estimated comparing changes
of the planar capacitor capacitance was observed to be quite significant",2007-02-27T20:53:24Z
A Binary Model for the UV-upturn of Elliptical Galaxies,"The discovery of an excess of light in the far-ultraviolet (UV) in 1969 in
elliptical galaxies was a major surprise. While it is now clear that this UV
excess (UV-upturn) is probably caused by an old population of helium-burning
stars. Han et al (2002, 2003) proposed a binary model for the formation of hot
subdwarfs (helium burning stars) and the model can reproduce the observations
in our Galaxy. By applying the binary model to the study of evolutionary
population synthesis, we have obtained an {\it a priori} model for the
UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies. The model shows that the UV-upturn is most
likely resulted from binary interactions and it is universal (not very much
metallicity-dependant) in ellipticals. This has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the UV-upturn and elliptical galaxies in
general; contrary to previous postulates, it implies that the UV-upturn is not
a sign of age, but could be a potentially powerful indicator for a recent minor
burst of star-forming activity.",2007-03-15T11:11:13Z
"Multiple magnetic transitions and magnetocaloric effect in
  Gd1-xSmxMn2Ge2 compounds","Magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of polycrystalline samples of
Gd1-xSmxMn2Ge2 have been studied. All the compounds except GdMn2Ge2 show
re-entrant ferromagnetic behavior. Multiple magnetic transitions observed in
these compounds are explained on the basis of the temperature dependences of
the exchange strengths of the rare earth and Mn sublattices. Magnetocaloric
effect is found to be positive at the re-entrant ferromagnetic transition,
whereas it is negative at the antiferro-ferromagnetic transition. In SmMn2Ge2,
the magnetic entropy change associated with the re-entrant transition is found
to decrease with field, which is attributed to the admixture effect of the
crystal field levels. The isothermal magnetic entropy change is found to
decrease with increase in Sm concentration.",2007-02-05T16:39:03Z
"A hybrid method coupling fluctuating hydrodynamics and molecular
  dynamics for the simulation of macromolecules","We present a hybrid computational method for simulating the dynamics of
macromolecules in solution which couples a mesoscale solver for the fluctuating
hydrodynamics (FH) equations with molecular dynamics to describe the
macromolecule. The two models interact through a dissipative Stokesian term
first introduced by Ahlrichs and D\""unweg [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 111}, 8225
(1999)]. We show that our method correctly captures the static and dynamical
properties of polymer chains as predicted by the Zimm model. In particular, we
show that the static conformations are best described when the ratio
$\frac{\sigma}{b}=0.6$, where $\sigma$ is the Lennard-Jones length parameter
and $b$ is the monomer bond length. We also find that the decay of the Rouse
modes' autocorrelation function is better described with an analytical
correction suggested by Ahlrichs and D\""unweg. Our FH solver permits us to
treat the fluid equation of state and transport parameters as direct simulation
parameters. The expected independence of the chain dynamics on various choices
of fluid equation of state and bulk viscosity is recovered, while excellent
agreement is found for the temperature and shear viscosity dependence of centre
of mass diffusion between simulation results and predictions of the Zimm model.
We find that Zimm model approximations start to fail when the Schmidt number
$Sc \lessapprox 30$. Finally, we investigate the importance of fluid
fluctuations and show that using the preaveraged approximation for the
hydrodynamic tensor leads to around 3% error in the diffusion coefficient for a
polymer chain when the fluid discretization size is greater than $50\AA$.",2007-03-04T21:01:59Z
"Ferromagnetism in Fe-doped ZnO Nanocrystals: Experimental and
  Theoretical investigations","Fe-doped ZnO nanocrystals are successfully synthesized and structurally
characterized by using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.
Magnetization measurements on the same system reveal a ferromagnetic to
paramagnetic transition temperature > 450 K with a low-temperature transition
from ferromagnetic to spin-glass state due to canting of the disordered surface
spins in the nanoparticle system. Local magnetic probes like EPR and Mossbauer
indicate the presence of Fe in both valence states Fe2+ and Fe3+. We argue that
the presence of Fe3+ is due to the possible hole doping in the system by cation
(Zn) vacancies. In a successive ab-initio electronic structure calculation, the
effects of defects (e.g. O- and Zn-vacancy) on the nature and origin of
ferromagnetism are investigated for Fe-doped ZnO system. Electronic structure
calculations suggest hole doping (Zn-vacancy) to be more effective to stabilize
ferromagnetism in Fe doped ZnO and our results are consistent with the
experimental signature of hole doping in the ferromagnetic Fe doped ZnO
samples.",2007-02-22T14:58:33Z
"Triplet pairing and upper critical field in the mixed state of d-wave
  superconductors","We show that an additional triplet component of the order parameter is
generated in the vortex phase of the d-wave superconductor. Spatial variations
of the triplet component are analyzed for a strong spin-orbit coupling.
Corrections to the London equation and an unusual temperature dependence of the
upper critical field, are obtained in the case of the weak spin-orbit coupling.",2007-02-22T13:33:44Z
"Strong-field effects in the Rabi oscillations of the superconducting
  phase qubit","Rabi oscillations have been observed in many superconducting devices, and
represent prototypical logic operations for quantum bits (qubits) in a quantum
computer. We use a three-level multiphoton analysis to understand the behavior
of the superconducting phase qubit (current-biased Josephson junction) at high
microwave drive power. Analytical and numerical results for the ac Stark shift,
single-photon Rabi frequency, and two-photon Rabi frequency are compared to
measurements made on a dc SQUID phase qubit with Nb/AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions.
Good agreement is found between theory and experiment.",2007-03-02T22:27:09Z
"Where are all the gravastars? Limits upon the gravastar model from
  accreting black holes","The gravastar model, which postulates a strongly correlated thin shell of
anisotropic matter surrounding a region of anti-de Sitter space, has been
proposed as an alternative to black holes. We discuss constraints that
present-day observations of well-known black hole candidates place on this
model. We focus upon two black hole candidates known to have extraordinarily
low luminosities: the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center,
Sagittarius A*, and the stellar-mass black hole, XTE J1118+480. We find that
the length scale for modifications of the type discussed in Chapline et al.
(2003) must be sub-Planckian.",2007-01-29T03:04:28Z
"Bias-dependent Contact Resistance in Rubrene Single-Crystal Field-Effect
  Transistors","We report a systematic study of the bias-dependent contact resistance in
rubrene single-crystal field-effect transistors with Ni, Co, Cu, Au, and Pt
electrodes. We show that the reproducibility in the values of contact
resistance strongly depends on the metal, ranging from a factor of two for Ni
to more than three orders of magnitude for Au. Surprisingly, FETs with Ni, Co,
and Cu contacts exhibits an unexpected reproducibility of the bias-dependent
differential conductance of the contacts, once this has been normalized to the
value measured at zero bias. This reproducibility may enable the study of
microscopic carrier injection processes into organic semiconductors.",2007-03-01T17:04:50Z
"Two-Dimensionality of Magnetic Excitations on the Trellis Lattice:
  (La,Sr,Ca)$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ and SrCu$_2$O$_3$","We explore the properties of magnetic excitations on the trellis lattice
which is relevant for the so-called telephone-number compounds
A$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ and the system SrCu$_2$O$_3$. The trellis lattice
consists of two-leg ladders which are coupled in a strongly frustrated fashion.
We use the effective model obtained for a single two-leg spin ladder to
calculate the two-dimensional one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding
one-triplon contribution to the dynamical structure factor. Special attention
is laid on signatures of the frustrating inter-ladder magnetic exchange. A
detailed suggestion is made for an experimental detection of this exchange in
inelastic neutron scattering experiments.",2007-01-23T13:54:08Z
Thermodynamic fluctuation relation for temperature and energy,"The present work extends the well-known thermodynamic relation $C=\beta ^{2}<
\delta {E^{2}}>$ for the canonical ensemble. We start from the general
situation of the thermodynamic equilibrium between a large but finite system of
interest and a generalized thermostat, which we define in the course of the
paper. The resulting identity $< \delta \beta \delta {E}> =1+< \delta {E^{2}}%
> \partial ^{2}S(E) /\partial {E^{2}}$ can account for thermodynamic states
with a negative heat capacity $C<0$; at the same time, it represents a
thermodynamic fluctuation relation that imposes some restrictions on the
determination of the microcanonical caloric curve $\beta (E) =\partial S(E)
/\partial E$. Finally, we comment briefly on the implications of the present
result for the development of new Monte Carlo methods and an apparent analogy
with quantum mechanics.",2007-02-01T22:40:42Z
Spin chain simulations with a meron cluster algorithm,"We apply a meron cluster algorithm to the XY spin chain, which describes a
quantum rotor. This is a multi-cluster simulation supplemented by an improved
estimator, which deals with objects of half-integer topological charge. This
method is powerful enough to provide precise results for the model with a
theta-term - it is therefore one of the rare examples, where a system with a
complex action can be solved numerically. In particular we measure the
correlation length, as well as the topological and magnetic susceptibility. We
discuss the algorithmic efficiency in view of the critical slowing down. Due to
the excellent performance that we observe, it is strongly motivated to work on
new applications of meron cluster algorithms in higher dimensions.",2007-01-15T14:38:48Z
Fluctuation theorems: Work is not an observable,"The characteristic function of the work performed by an external
time-dependent force on a Hamiltonian quantum system is identified with the
time-ordered correlation function of the exponentiated system's Hamiltonian. A
similar expression is obtained for the averaged exponential work which is
related to the free energy difference of equilibrium systems by the Jarzynski
work theorem.",2007-03-07T17:12:25Z
"Dynamics of unvisited sites in presence of mutually repulsive random
  walkers","We have considered the persistence of unvisited sites of a lattice, i.e., the
probability $S(t)$ that a site remains unvisited till time $t$ in presence of
mutually repulsive random walkers. The dynamics of this system has direct
correspondence to that of the domain walls in a certain system of Ising spins
where the number of domain walls become fixed following a zero termperature
quench. Here we get the result that $S(t) \propto \exp(-\alpha t^{\beta})$
where $\beta$ is close to 0.5 and $\alpha$ a function of the density of the
walkers $\rho$. The number of persistent sites in presence of independent
walkers of density $\rho^\prime$ is known to be $S^\prime (t) = \exp(-2
\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \rho^\prime t^{1/2})$. We show that a mapping of the
interacting walkers' problem to the independent walkers' problem is possible
with $\rho^\prime = \rho/(1-\rho)$ provided $\rho^\prime, \rho$ are small. We
also discuss some other intricate results obtained in the interacting walkers'
case.",2007-03-06T09:44:39Z
"Effect of substrate-induced strain on transport and magnetic properties
  of epitaxial La_0.66Sr_0.33MnO_3 thin films","We have studied electrical transport and magnetic properties of epitaxial
La_0.66 Sr_0.33 Mn O_3 thin films grown on different substrates having
different lattice strains induced by different film-substrate lattice-mismatch.
Both electrical transport and magnetic properties exhibit strong correlation
with Jahn-Teller strain. Our study shows a sufficiently large Jahn-Teller
strain giving rise to distinct semi-conducting/insulating state in LSMO thin
films even below the respective para-ferromagnetic Curie temperatutes Tc, which
is in contradiction with the established phase diagram of Sr-doped manganites.
We have presented a microscopic model for the analysis of our data instead of
the usual expansion around the undistorted state generally in use in the
literature. The model incorporates the two relevant e_g orbitals (and their
ordering thereof) and the effect of both Jahn-Teller and bulk strain on the
transition temperature via double exchange.",2007-02-04T07:23:16Z
"Functional Renormalization Group calculation of the Fermi surface of a
  spin-ladder","We study non conventional superconductivity on a ladder, improving the
predictions of the Hubbard model. The determination of the Fermi surface, in 2
or 3 dimensions, remains a very hard task, but it is exactly solvable for a
single ladder. We use functional Renormalisation Group methods, which prove,
here, scheme-dependant. In the superconducting phase, the binding/antibinding
gap is stabilized, but in the antiferromagnetic phase, it shrinks and the
ladder turns one-dimensional.",2007-02-19T14:25:37Z
Coherent spectral weight of Gutzwiller-projected superconductors,"We analyze the electronic Green's functions in the superconducting ground
state of the t-J model using Gutzwiller-projected wave functions, and compare
them to the conventional BCS form. Some of the properties of the BCS state are
preserved by the projection: the total spectral weight is continuous around the
quasiparticle node and approximately constant along the Fermi surface. On the
other hand, the overall spectral weight is reduced by the projection with a
momentum-dependent renormalization, and the projection produces electron-hole
asymmetry in renormalization of the electron and hole spectral weights. The
latter asymmetry leads to the bending of the effective Fermi surface which we
define as the locus of equal electron and hole spectral weight.",2007-01-14T18:16:30Z
"Irregular Satellites of the Planets: Products of Capture in the Early
  Solar System","All four giant planets in the Solar system possess irregular satellites,
characterized by large, highly eccentric and/or inclined orbits that are
distinct from the nearly circular, uninclined orbits of the regular satellites.
This difference can be traced directly to different modes of formation. Whereas
the regular satellites grew by accretion within circumplanetary disks the
irregular satellites were captured from initially heliocentric orbits at an
early epoch. Recently, powerful survey observations have greatly increased the
number of known irregular satellites, permitting a fresh look at the group
properties of these objects and motivating a re-examination of the mechanisms
of capture. None of the suggested mechanisms, including gas-drag, pull-down,
and three-body capture, convincingly fit the group characteristics of the
irregular satellites. The sources of the satellites also remain unidentified.",2007-03-03T03:11:33Z
"Theory of conserved spin current and its application to two dimensional
  hole gas","We present a detailed microscopic theory of the conserved spin current which
is introduced by us [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{96}, 196602 (2006)] and satisfies
the spin continuity equation even for spin-orbit coupled systems. The spin
transport coefficients $\sigma_{\mu\nu}^{s}$ as a response to the electric
field are shown to consist of two parts, i.e., the conventional part
$\sigma_{\mu\nu}^{s0}$ and the spin torque dipole correction $\sigma_{\mu\nu
}^{s\tau}$. As one key result, an Onsager relation between $\sigma_{\mu\nu
}^{s}$ and other kinds of transport coefficients are shown. The expression for
$\sigma_{\mu\nu}^{s}$ in terms of single-particle Bloch states are derived, by
use of which we study the conserved spin Hall conductivity in the two
dimensional hole gas modeled by a combined Luttinger and SIA Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. It is shown that the two components in spin Hall conductivity usually
have the opposite contributions. While in the absence of Rashba spin splitting,
the spin Hall transport is dominated by the conventional contribution, the
presence of Rashba spin splitting stirs up a large enhancement of the spin
torque dipole correction, leading to an overall sign change for the total spin
Hall conductivity. Furthermore, an approximate two-band calculation and the
subsequent comparison with the exact four-band results are given, which reveals
that the coupling between the heavy hole and light hole bands should be taken
into account for strong Rashba spin splitting.",2007-01-13T06:48:50Z
Introduction to FFLO phases and collective mode in the BEC-BCS crossover,"The main focus of this paper is a discussion of what might happen in a BCS
superfluid when there is an imbalance between the two populations of fermionic
particles forming Cooper pairs, having in mind the case of ultracold Fermi
gases. In the last part the evolution in the BEC-BCS crossover of the
collective mode arising in such a superfluid (with balanced atomic populations)
is briefly considered.",2007-02-16T17:43:31Z
Imaging a Coupled Quantum Dot - Quantum Point Contact System,"We performed measurements on a quantum dot and a capacitively coupled quantum
point contact by using the sharp metallic tip of a low-temperature scanning
force microscope as a scanned gate. The quantum point contact served as a
detector for charges on the dot or nearby. It allowed us to distinguish single
electron charging events in several charge traps from charging events on the
dot. We analyzed the tip-induced potential quantitatively and found its shape
to be independent of the voltage applied to the tip within a certain range of
parameters. We estimate that the trap density is below 0.1% of the doping
density and that the interaction energy between the quantum dot and a trap is a
significant portion of the dot's charging energy. Possibly, such charge traps
are the reason for frequently observed parametric charge rearrangements.",2007-02-13T12:46:16Z
"Characterizing electron entanglement in multiterminal mesoscopic
  conductors","We show that current correlations at the exit ports of a beam splitter can be
used to detect electronic entanglement for a fairly general input state. This
includes the situation where electron pairs can enter the beam splitter from
the same port or be separated due to backscattering. The proposed scheme allows
to discriminate between occupation-number and degree-of-freedom entanglement.",2007-02-22T10:34:04Z
"Coupling between the 45 Hz Horizontal-Branch Oscillation and the Normal
  Branch Oscillation in Scorpius X-1","The observations of the bright persistent neutron star low-mass X-ray binary
(LMXB) Sco X-1 performed with the {\it Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer} (RXTE) show
a $\sim$ 6 Hz normal-branch oscillation (NBO), a $\sim$ 45 Hz horizontal-branch
oscillation (HBO), and twin kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) on its
normal branch simultaneously. We have found that the fractional amplitude of
the HBO corresponding to the NBO phase of high flux is 1.1%, while that of the
NBO phase of low flux is undetectable, with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.4%,
implying that the HBO strength varies with the NBO phase in an opposite way to
that of the lower kHz QPO previously found, and suggests that the condition for
the generation of the HBO is met when the NBO flux is high. The 6 Hz NBO in Sco
X-1 connects the 45 Hz HBO and the twin kHz QPO together, showing a unique
picture indicating a coupling between the QPOs, which has never been observed
in other neutron star LMXBs. We discuss the implications for current models of
the 45 Hz HBO, the 6 Hz NBO, and the twin kHz QPOs.",2007-03-08T06:04:18Z
Weighted network modules,"The inclusion of link weights into the analysis of network properties allows
a deeper insight into the (often overlapping) modular structure of real-world
webs. We introduce a clustering algorithm (CPMw, Clique Percolation Method with
weights) for weighted networks based on the concept of percolating k-cliques
with high enough intensity. The algorithm allows overlaps between the modules.
First, we give detailed analytical and numerical results about the critical
point of weighted k-clique percolation on (weighted) Erdos-Renyi graphs. Then,
for a scientist collaboration web and a stock correlation graph we compute
three-link weight correlations and with the CPMw the weighted modules. After
reshuffling link weights in both networks and computing the same quantities for
the randomised control graphs as well, we show that groups of 3 or more strong
links prefer to cluster together in both original graphs.",2007-03-27T10:29:32Z
"Construction of a Versatile Ultra-Low Temperature Scanning Tunneling
  Microscope","We constructed a dilution-refrigerator (DR) based ultra-low temperature
scanning tunneling microscope (ULT-STM) which works at temperatures down to 30
mK, in magnetic fields up to 6 T and in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). Besides these
extreme operation conditions, this STM has several unique features not
available in other DR based ULT-STMs. One can load STM tips as well as samples
with clean surfaces prepared in a UHV environment to an STM head keeping low
temperature and UHV conditions. After then, the system can be cooled back to
near the base temperature within 3 hours. Due to these capabilities, it has a
variety of applications not only for cleavable materials but also for almost
all conducting materials. The present ULT-STM has also an exceptionally high
stability in the presence of magnetic field and even during field sweep. We
describe details of its design, performance and applications for low
temperature physics.",2007-03-03T13:08:42Z
Vortex mass in a superfluid at low frequencies,"An inertial mass of a vortex can be calculated by driving it round in a
circle with a steadily revolving pinning potential. We show that in the low
frequency limit this gives precisely the same formula that was used by Baym and
Chandler, but find that the result is not unique and depends on the force field
used to cause the acceleration. We apply this method to the Gross-Pitaevskii
model, and derive a simple formula for the vortex mass. We study both the long
range and short range properties of the solution. We agree with earlier results
that the non-zero compressibility leads to a divergent mass. From the
short-range behavior of the solution we find that the mass is sensitive to the
form of the pinning potential, and diverges logarithmically when the radius of
this potential tends to zero.",2007-03-20T17:04:53Z
"The interaction between radio lobes and hot gas in the nearby radio
  galaxies 3C285 and 3C442A","We present Chandra observations of two nearby radio galaxies in group
environments, 3C285 and 3C442A. The host galaxies of both sources are involved
in mergers with nearby massive galaxies, and the hot gas in the systems is
extended along lines joining the interacting galaxies. Both sources show strong
evidence for interactions between the radio lobes and the asymmetrical hot gas.
We argue that the structure in the hot gas is independent of the existence of
the radio lobes in these systems, and argue that hot gas shaped by an ongoing
massive galaxy merger may play an important role in the dynamics of radio lobes
in other objects. For 3C442A, our observations show that gas is being driven
out of both members of the host interacting galaxy pair, and the implied
constraints on galaxy velocities are consistent with mildly supersonic motions
with respect to the group-scale hot gas. The previously known filamentary radio
structure in the center of 3C442A may be a result of the interaction between
hot gas expelled from these galaxies and pre-existing radio-emitting plasma. In
3C285, where there is no ongoing galaxy merger, the powerful radio source is
probably having a significant effect on the energetics of the host group.",2007-03-05T19:33:54Z
"Comment on Improved Analysis of List Decoding and Its Application to
  Convolutional Codes and Turbo Codes","In a recent paper [1] an improved analysis concerning the analysis of List
Decoding was presented. The event that the correct codeword is excluded from
the list is central. For the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel an
important quantity is the in [1] called effective Euclidean distance. This was
earlier considered in [2] under the name Vector Euclidean Distance, where also
a simple mathematical expression for this quantity was easily derived for any
list size. In [1], a geometrical analysis gives this when the list size is 1, 2
or 3.",2007-02-02T16:33:54Z
"Generalized Statistics Framework for Rate Distortion Theory with Bregman
  Divergences","A variational principle for the rate distortion (RD) theory with Bregman
divergences is formulated within the ambit of the generalized (nonextensive)
statistics of Tsallis. The Tsallis-Bregman RD lower bound is established.
Alternate minimization schemes for the generalized Bregman RD (GBRD) theory are
derived. A computational strategy to implement the GBRD model is presented. The
efficacy of the GBRD model is exemplified with the aid of numerical
simulations.",2007-01-10T18:48:17Z
"Black Hole Spin Evolution: Implications for Short-hard Gamma Ray Bursts
  and Gravitational Wave Detection","The evolution of the spin and tilt of black holes in compact black hole -
neutron star and black hole - black hole binary systems is investigated within
the framework of the coalescing compact star binary model for short gamma ray
bursts via the population synthesis method. Based on recent results on
accretion at super critical rates in slim disk models, estimates of natal
kicks, and the results regarding fallback in supernova models, we obtain the
black hole spin and misalignment. It is found that the spin parameter, a_spin},
is less than 0.5 for initially non rotating black holes and the tilt angle,
i_tilt, is less than 45 deg for 50% of the systems in black hole - neutron star
binaries. Upon comparison with the results of black hole - neutron star merger
calculations we estimate that only a small fraction (~ 0.01) of these systems
can lead to the formation of a torus surrounding the coalesced binary
potentially producing a short-hard gamma ray burst. On the other hand, for high
initial black hole spin parameters (a_spin>0.6) this fraction can be
significant (~ 0.4). It is found that the predicted gravitational radiation
signal for our simulated population does not significantly differ from that for
non rotating black holes. Due to the (i) insensitivity of signal detection
techniques to the black hole spin and the (ii) predicted overall low
contribution of black hole binaries to the signal we find that the detection of
gravitational waves are not greatly inhibited by current searches with non
spinning templates. It is pointed out that the detection of a black hole -
black hole binary inspiral system with LIGO or VIRGO may provide a direct
measurement of the initial spin of a black hole.",2007-03-06T22:06:18Z
"Is magnetoresistance in excess of 1,000 % possible in Ni point contacts?","Electronic transport in nickel magnetic point contacts is investigated with a
combination of density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green
functions method. In particular we address the possibility of huge ballistic
magnetoresistance in impurity-free point contacts and the effects of oxygen
impurities. On-site corrections over the local spin density approximation
(LSDA) for the exchange and correlation potential, namely the LDA+U method, are
applied in order to account for low-coordination and strong correlations. We
show that impurity-free point contacts present magnetoresistance never in
excess of 50%. This value can raise up to about 450 % in the case of oxygen
contamination. These results suggest that magnetoresistance in excess of 1,000
% can not have solely electronic origin.",2007-01-22T10:52:50Z
Multiple-source optical spectral weight transfer in ferromagnetic EuB6,"We present the first wide range (2 meV$-$5.5 eV) optical conductivity of
EuB$_6$ from reflectivity and ellipsometry measurements. Upon the ferromagnetic
transition at T$_{c}$=15.5 K, interband transition $\sigma_{1}(\omega)$
decreases at three different energy $\omega$=0.5, 1.4, 2.75 eV and the lost
spectral weight is transferred to the Drude $\sigma_{1}(\omega)$ at
$\omega<$0.33 eV. We succeeded in explaining this unprecedented multiple-energy
$\sigma_{1}(\omega)$ change using LDA+U calculated band structure by Kunes and
Pickett (Phys. Rev. B, $\textbf{69}$,165111). Our finding supports strongly
that (1) EuB$_6$ is a semimetal and (2) the exchange-driven band splitting is
the primary source of the drastic $\rho(T)$ and $\omega_{p}^{2}$ changes at T
$<$ T$_{c}$.",2007-03-10T20:08:04Z
Resonant switching using spin valves,"Using micromagnetics we demonstrate that the r.f. field produced by a spin
valve can be used to reverse the magnetization in a magnetic nanoparticle. The
r.f. field is generated using a current that specifically excites a uniform
spin wave in the spin valve. This current is swept such that the
chirped-frequency generated by the valve matches the angular dependent resonant
frequency of the anisotropy-dominated magnetic nanoparticle, as a result of
which the magnetization reversal occurs. The switching is fast, requires
currents similar to those used in recent experiments with spin valves, and is
stable with respect to small perturbations. This phenomenon can potentially be
employed in magnetic information storage devices or recently discussed magnetic
computing schemes.",2007-03-11T04:46:23Z
"Exploiting Locally Imposed Anisotropies in (Ga,Mn)As: a Non-volatile
  Memory Device","Progress in (Ga,Mn)As lithography has recently allowed us to realize
structures where unique magnetic anisotropy properties can be imposed locally
in various regions of a given device. We make use of this technology to
fabricate a device in which we study transport through a constriction
separating two regions whose magnetization direction differs by 90 degrees. We
find that the resistance of the constriction depends on the flow of the
magnetic field lines in the constriction region and demonstrate that such a
structure constitutes a non-volatile memory device.",2007-01-19T13:46:17Z
Valence-band mixing in first-principles envelope-function theory,"This paper presents a numerical implementation of a first-principles
envelope-function theory derived recently by the author [B. A. Foreman, Phys.
Rev. B 72, 165345 (2005)]. The examples studied deal with the valence subband
structure of GaAs/AlAs, GaAs/Al(0.2)Ga(0.8)As, and In(0.53)Ga(0.47)As/InP (001)
superlattices calculated using the local density approximation to
density-functional theory and norm-conserving pseudopotentials without
spin-orbit coupling. The heterostructure Hamiltonian is approximated using
quadratic response theory, with the heterostructure treated as a perturbation
of a bulk reference crystal. The valence subband structure is reproduced
accurately over a wide energy range by a multiband envelope-function
Hamiltonian with linear renormalization of the momentum and mass parameters.
Good results are also obtained over a more limited energy range from a
single-band model with quadratic renormalization. The effective kinetic-energy
operator ordering derived here is more complicated than in many previous
studies, consisting in general of a linear combination of all possible operator
orderings. In some cases the valence-band Rashba coupling differs significantly
from the bulk magnetic Luttinger parameter. The splitting of the
quasidegenerate ground state of no-common-atom superlattices has non-negligible
contributions from both short-range interface mixing and long-range dipole
terms in the quadratic density response.",2007-01-17T02:38:33Z
"Suppression of Mott-Hubbard states and metal-insulator transitions in
  the two band Hubbard model","I investigate band and Mott insulating states in a two-band Hubbard model,
with the aim of understanding the differences between the idealised one-orbital
model and the more realistic multi-band case. Using a projection ansatz I show
that additional orbitals suppress the metal-insulator transition, leading to a
critical coupling of approximately eight times the bare band-width. I also
demonstrate the effects of orbital ordering, which hinder Mott-Hubbard states
and open a band gap. Since multi-band correlations are common in real
materials, this work suggests that the existence of very strongly correlated
band insulators may be more common than Mott-Hubbard insulators.",2007-02-27T14:45:13Z
Hypernuclear Physics and Compact Stars,"Hypernuclear physics plays a decisive role for several features of compact

properties of neutron stars.",2007-03-06T12:07:50Z
"Universal behavior of $\rm CePd_{1-x}Rh_x$ Ferromagnet at Quantum
  Critical Point","The heavy-fermion metal $\rm CePd_{1-x}Rh_x$ can be tuned from ferromagnetism
at $x=0$ to non-magnetic state at some critical concentration $x_c$. The
non-Fermi liquid behavior (NFL) at $x\simeq x_c$ is recognized by power low
dependence of the specific heat $C(T)$ given by the electronic contribution,
magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$ and volume expansion coefficient $\alpha(T)$
at low temperatures: $C/T\propto\chi(T)\propto\alpha(T)/T\propto1/\sqrt{T}$. We
also demonstrate that the behavior of normalized effective mass $M^*_N$
observed in $\rm CePd_{1-x}Rh_x$ at $x\simeq 0.8$ agrees with that of $M^*_N$
observed in paramagnetic $\rm CeRu_2Si_2$ and conclude that these alloys
exhibit the universal NFL thermodynamic behavior at their quantum critical
points. We show that the NFL behavior of $\rm CePd_{1-x}Rh_x$ can be accounted
for within frameworks of quasiparticle picture and fermion condensation quantum
phase transition, while this alloy exhibits a universal thermodynamic NFL
behavior which is independent of the characteristic features of the given alloy
such as its lattice structure, magnetic ground state, dimension etc.",2007-03-18T22:38:01Z
D-wave correlated Critical Bose Liquids in two dimensions,"We develop a description of a new quantum liquid phase of interacting bosons
in 2d which possesses relative D-wave two-body correlations and which we call a
D-wave Bose Liquid (DBL). The DBL has no broken symmetries, supports gapless
boson excitations residing on ""Bose surfaces"" in momentum space, and exhibits
power law correlations with continuously variable exponents. While the DBL can
be constructed for bosons in the 2d continuum, the state only respects the
point group symmetries of the square lattice. On the lattice the DBL respects
all symmetries and does not require a particular filling. But lattice effects
allow a second distinct phase, a quasi-local variant which we call a D-wave
Local Bose Liquid (DLBL). Remarkably, the DLBL has short-range boson
correlations and hence no Bose surfaces, despite sharing gapless excitations
and other critical signatures with the DBL. Moreover, both phases are metals
with a resistance that vanishes as a power of the temperature. We establish
these results by constructing a class of many-particle wavefunctions for the
DBL, which are time reversal invariant analogs of Laughlin's quantum Hall
wavefunction for bosons at $\nu=1/2$. A gauge theory formulation leads to a
simple mean field theory, and an N-flavor generalization enables incorporation
of gauge field fluctuations to deduce the properties of the DBL/DLBL; various
equal time correlation functions are in qualitative accord with the properties
inferred from the wavefunctions. We also identify a promising Hamiltonian which
might manifest the DBL or DLBL, and perform a variational study comparing to
other competing phases. We suggest how the DBL wavefunction can be generalized
to describe an itinerant non-Fermi liquid phase of electrons on the square
lattice with a no double occupancy constraint, a D-wave metal phase.",2007-03-12T17:10:20Z
"Predictions of Dynamic Behavior Under Pressure for Two Scenarios to
  Explain Water Anomalies","Using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field calculations for a cell model of
water we find a dynamic crossover in the orientational correlation time $\tau$
from non-Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures to Arrhenius behavior at low
temperatures. This dynamic crossover is independent of whether water at very
low temperature is charaterized by a ``liquid-liquid critical point'' or by the
``singularity free'' scenario. We relate $\tau$ to fluctuations of hydrogen
bond network and show that the crossover found for $\tau$ for both scenarios is
a consequence of the sharp change in the average number of hydrogen bonds at
the temperature of the specific heat maximum. We find that the effect of
pressure on the dynamics is strikingly different in the two scenarios, offering
a means to distinguish between them.",2007-02-05T15:57:51Z
"Old main-sequence turnoff photometry in the SMC: Star Formation History
  and Chemical Enrichment Law","We present deep ground-based {\it B} and {\it R} observations of 12 fields in
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The resulting color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)
reach the oldest main-sequence (MS) turnoff at M$_{R}$$\thicksim$3.5 and reveal
the stellar population differences between the part of the galaxy facing the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and an area on the opposite side. In the Southern
part of the galaxy, we found that there are still intermediate-age stars as far
as 4 kpc from the SMC center.

"No evidence for spontaneous orbital currents in finite size studies of
  three-band models for CuO planes","We have numerically evaluated the current-current correlations for three-band
models of the CuO planes in high-T_c superconductors at hole doping x=1/8. The
results show no evidence for the orbital current patterns proposed by Varma. If
such patterns exist, the associated energy is estimated to be smaller than 5
meV per link even if epsilon_p-epsilon_d=0. Assuming that the three-band models
are adequate, quantum critical fluctuations of such patterns hence cannot be
responsible for phenomena occurring at significantly higher energies, such as
superconductivity or the anomalous properties of the pseudogap phase.",2007-01-11T14:33:30Z
Full Potential Multiple Scattering for X-ray Spectroscopies,"We present a Full Potential Multiple Scattering (FP-MS) scheme for the
interpretation of several X-ray spectroscopies that is a straightforward
generalization of the more conventional Muffin-Tin (MT) version. Like this
latter, it preserves the intuitive description of the physical process under
consideration and overcomes some of the limitations of the existing FP-MS
codes. It hinges on a fast and efficient method for solving the single cell
scattering problem that avoids the convergence drawbacks of the angular
momentum (AM) expansion of the cell shape function and relies on an alternative
derivation of the multiple scattering equations (MSE) that allows us to work
reliably with only one truncation parameter, {\it i.e.} the number of local
basis functions in the expansion of the global scattering function determined
by the classical relation $l_{\rm max} \sim k R$.",2007-02-22T19:56:11Z
"Looking for Giant Earths in the HD 209458 System: A Search for Transits
  in MOST Space-based Photometry","We have made a comprehensive transit search for exoplanets down to about 2
Earth radii in the HD 209458 system, based on nearly uninterrupted broadband
optical photometry obtained with the MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of
Stars) satellite, spanning 14 days in 2004 and 44 days in 2005. We have
searched these data for limb-darkened transits at periods other than that of
the known giant planet, from about 0.5 days to 2 weeks. Monte Carlo statistical
tests of the data with synthetic transits inserted allow us to rule out
additional close-in exoplanets with sizes ranging from about 0.20-0.36 RJ
(Jupiter radii), or 2.2-4.0 RE (Earth radii) on orbits whose planes are near
that of HD 209458b. These null results constrain theories that invoke lower
mass planets in orbits similar to HD 209458b to explain its anomalously large
radius, and those that predict ""hot Earths"" due to the inward migration of HD
209458b.",2007-03-28T05:34:09Z
Gnutella: Topology Dynamics On Phase Space,"In this paper, the topology dynamic of Gnutella is studied through phase
space. The dynamic changes in peer degree are studied as a time series in two
dimensional phase space which is defined as the number of connected leaves and
the number of connected ultras. The reported degrees are concentrated in three
special Software related regions that we named as Ultra Stable Region, Leaf
Stable Region and Transition Belt. A method is proposed to classify degree
traces in phase space into different classes. Connection churn then is studied
along with the churn in degree. It shows that the topological structure of
Gnutella is rather stable in its connection degree but not the topology itself.
The connection drop rate is estimated and the live time of connections is
inferred afterwards. M/M/m/m loss queue system is introduced to model the
degree keeping process in Gnutella. This model revealed that the degree stable
is ensured by large new connection efforts. In other words the stable in
topological structure of Gnutella is a results of essential unstable in its
topology. That opens a challenge to the basic design philosophy of this
network.",2007-02-04T08:12:38Z
Protostellar Turbulence Driven by Collimated Outflows,"The majority of stars are thought to form in clusters. Cluster formation in
dense clumps of molecular clouds is strongly influenced, perhaps controlled, by
supersonic turbulence. We have previously shown that the turbulence in regions
of active cluster formation is quickly transformed by the forming stars through
protostellar outflows, and that the outflow-driven protostellar turbulence is
the environment in which most of the cluster members form. Here, we take
initial steps in quantifying the global properties of the protostellar
turbulence through 3D MHD simulations. We find that collimated outflows are
more efficient in driving turbulence than spherical outflows that carry the
same amounts of momentum. Gravity plays an important role in shaping the
turbulence, generating infall motions in the cluster forming region that
balance the outward motions driven by outflows. The resulting quasi-equilibrium
state is maintained through a slow rate of star formation, with a fraction of
the total mass converted into stars per free fall time as low as a few percent.
Magnetic fields are dynamically important even in magnetically supercritical
clumps, provided that their initial strengths are not far below the critical
value for static cloud support. We find that the mass weighted PDF of the
volume density is often, although not always, approximately lognormal. The PDFs
of the column density deviate more strongly from lognormal distributions. There
is a prominent break in the velocity power spectrum of the protostellar
turbulence, which may provide a way to distinguish it from other types of
turbulence.",2007-03-07T16:38:11Z
Inelastic scattering from quantum impurities,"We review the non-perturbative theoretical framework set up recently to
compute the inelastic scattering cross section from quantum impurities [G.
Zar\'and {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 107204 (2004)] and show how
it can be applied to a number of quantum impurity models. We first use this
method for the $S=1/2$ single-channel Kondo model and the Anderson model. In
both cases, a large plateau is found in the inelastic scattering rate for
incoming energies above $T_K$, and a quasi-linear regime appears in the energy
range $0.05 T_K < \omega < 0.5 T_K$, in agreement with the experimental
observations. We also present results for the 2-channel Kondo model, the
prototype of all non-Fermi liquid models, and show that there half of the
scattering remains inelastic even at the Fermi energy.",2007-03-12T12:53:56Z
"Vanishing Integral Relations and Expectation Values for Bloch Functions
  in Finite Domains","Integral identities for particular Bloch functions in finite periodic systems
are derived. All following statements are proven for a finite domain consisting
of an integer number of unit cells. It is shown that matrix elements of

"Electronic viscosity in a quantum well: A test for the local density
  approximation","In the local density approximation (LDA) for electronic time-dependent
current-density functional theory (TDCDFT) many-body effects are described in
terms of the visco-elastic constants of the homogeneous three-dimensional
electron gas. In this paper we critically examine the applicability of the
three-dimensional LDA to the calculation of the viscous damping of
1-dimensional collective oscillations of angular frequency $\omega$ in a quasi
2-dimensional quantum well. We calculate the effective viscosity
$\zeta(\omega)$ from perturbation theory in the screened Coulomb interaction
and compare it with the commonly used three-dimensional LDA viscosity
$Y(\omega)$. Significant differences are found. At low frequency $Y(\omega)$ is
dominated by a shear term, which is absent in $\zeta(\omega)$. At high
frequency $\zeta(\omega)$ and $Y(\omega)$ exhibit different power law behaviors
($\omega^{-3}$ and $\omega^{-5/2}$ respectively), reflecting different spectral
densities of electron-hole excitations in two and three dimensions. These
findings demonstrate the need for better approximations for the
exchange-correlation stress tensor in specific systems where the use of the
three-dimensional functionals may lead to unphysical results.",2007-02-23T03:38:37Z
The classical granular temperature and slightly beyond,"One goal of this paper is to discuss the classical definition of granular
temperature as an extension of its thermodynamic equivalent and a useful
concept which provides an important characterization of fluidized granular
matter. Following a review of some basic concepts and techniques (with emphasis
on fundamental issues) we present new results for a system that can exhibit
strong violations of equipartition, yet is amenable to description by classical
granular hydrodynamics, namely a binary granular gas mixture. A second goal of
this article is to present a result that pertains to dense granular and
molecular solids alike, namely the existence of a correction to the elastic
energy which is related to the heat flux in the equations of continuum
mechanics. The latter is of the same (second) order in the strain as the
elastic energy. Although recent definitions of temperatures for granular
matter, glasses and other disordered many-body systems are not within the scope
of this article we do make several general comments on this subject in the
closing section.",2007-02-23T12:38:26Z

Quest for high Tc in layered structures: the case of LiB,"Using electronic structure calculation we study the superconducting
properties of the theoretically-devised superconductor MS1-LiB (LiB). We
calculate the electron-phonon coupling ($\lambda=0.62$) and the phonon
frequency logarithmic average ($<\omega >_{log}=54.6$ meV) and show that the
LiB critical temperature is in the range of 10-15 K, despite the frozen-phonon
deformation potential being of the same order of MgB$_2$. As a consequence, LiB
captures some of the essential physics of MgB$_2$ but (i) the electron-phonon
coupling due to $\sigma$ states is smaller and (ii) the precious contribution
of the $\pi$ carriers to the critical temperature is lacking. We investigate
the possible change in $T_c$ that can be induced by doping and pressure and
find that these conditions cannot easily increase $T_c$ in LiB.",2007-01-10T12:22:19Z
Flow Equations for the BCS-BEC Crossover,"The functional renormalisation group is used for the BCS-BEC crossover in
gases of ultracold fermionic atoms. In a simple truncation, we see how
universality and an effective theory with composite bosonic di-atom states
emerge. We obtain a unified picture of the whole phase diagram. The flow
reflects different effective physics at different scales. In the BEC limit as
well as near the critical temperature, it describes an interacting bosonic
theory.",2007-01-10T11:56:00Z
Integrable spin-boson models descending from rational six-vertex models,"We construct commuting transfer matrices for models describing the
interaction between a single quantum spin and a single bosonic mode using the
quantum inverse scattering framework. The transfer matrices are obtained from
certain inhomogeneous rational vertex models combining bosonic and spin
representations of SU(2), subject to non-diagonal toroidal and open boundary
conditions. Only open boundary conditions are found to lead to integrable
Hamiltonians combining both rotating and counter-rotating terms in the
interaction. If the boundary matrices can be brought to triangular form
simultaneously, the spectrum of the model can be obtained by means of the
algebraic Bethe ansatz after a suitable gauge transformation; the corresponding
Hamiltonians are found to be non-hermitian. Alternatively, a certain
quasi-classical limit of the transfer matrix is considered where hermitian
Hamiltonians are obtained as members of a family of commuting operators; their
diagonalization, however, remains an unsolved problem.",2007-03-23T18:36:56Z

"Manganese trends in a sample of thin and thick disk stars. The origin of
  Mn","CONTEXT: Manganese is an iron-peak element and although the nucleosynthesis
path that leads to its formation is fairly well understood, it remains unclear
which objects, SN II and/or SN Ia, that contribute the majority of Mn to the
interstellar medium. It also remains unclear to which extent the supernovae Mn
yields depend on the metallicity of the progenitor star or not. AIMS: By using
a well studied and well defined sample of 95 dwarf stars we aim at further
constraining the formation site(s) of Mn. METHODS: We derive Mn abundances
through spectral synthesis of four Mn I lines at 539.4, 549.2, 601.3, and 601.6
nm. Stellar parameters and data for oxygen are taken from Bensby et al. (2003,
2004, 2005). RESULTS: When comparing our Mn abundances with O abundances for
the same stars we find that the abundance trends in the stars with kinematics
of the thick disk can be explained by metallicity dependent yields from SN II.
We go on and combine our data for dwarf stars in the disks with data for dwarf
and giant stars in the metal-poor thick disk and halo from the literature. We
find that dwarf and giant stars show the same trends, which indicates that
neither non-LTE nor evolutionary effects are a major concern for Mn.
Furthermore, the [Mn/O] vs [O/H] trend in the halo is flat. CONCLUSIONS: We
conclude that the simplest interpretation of our data is that Mn is most likely
produced in SN II and that the Mn yields for such SNae must be metallicity
dependent. Contribution from SN Ia in the metal-rich thin disk can not,
however, be excluded.",2007-03-19T15:00:46Z
"Branching, Capping, and Severing in Dynamic Actin Structures","Branched actin networks at the leading edge of a crawling cell evolve via
protein-regulated processes such as polymerization, depolymerization, capping,
branching, and severing. A formulation of these processes is presented and
analyzed to study steady-state network morphology. In bulk, we identify several
scaling regimes in severing and branching protein concentrations and find that
the coupling between severing and branching is optimally exploited for
conditions {\it in vivo}. Near the leading edge, we find qualitative agreement
with the {\it in vivo} morphology.",2007-03-15T12:42:49Z
Nanospintronics with carbon nanotubes,"One of the actual challenges of spintronics is the realization of a
spin-transistor allowing to control spin transport through an electrostatic
gate. In this review, we report on different experiments which demonstrate a
gate control of spin transport in a carbon nanotube connected to ferromagnetic
leads. We also discuss some theoretical approaches which can be used to analyze
spin transport in these systems. We emphasize the roles of the gate-tunable
quasi-bound states inside the nanotube and the coherent spin-dependent
scattering at the interfaces between the nanotube and its ferromagnetic
contacts.",2007-03-18T21:03:16Z
"Nonequilibrium Green's function method for thermal transport in

for thermal transport due to atomic vibrations in nanostructures. Some of the
key equations, such as self-energy and conductance with nonlinear effect, are
derived. A self-consistent mean-field theory is proposed. Computational
procedures are discussed. The method is applied to a number of systems
including one-dimensional chains, a benzene ring junction, and carbon
nanotubes. Mean-field calculations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model are compared
with classical molecular dynamics simulations. We find that nonlinearity
suppresses thermal transport even at moderately high temperatures.",2007-01-09T06:55:29Z
"Control of many electron states in semiconductor quantum dots by
  non-Abelian vector potentials","Adiabatic time evolution of degenerate eigenstates of a quantum system
provides a means for controlling electronic states since mixing between
degenerate levels generates a matrix Berry phase. In the presence of spin-orbit
coupling in n-type semiconductor quantum dots the electron Hamiltonian is
invariant under time reversal operation and the many body groundstate may be
doubly degenerate. This double degeneracy can generate non-Abelian vector
potentials when odd number of electrons are present. We find that the
antisymmetry of many electron wavefunction has no effect on the matrix Berry
phase. We have derived equations that allow one to investigate the effect of
electron correlations by expressing the non-Abelian vector potentials for many
electron system in terms of single electron non-Abelian vector potentials.",2007-01-15T07:38:46Z
"Irradiation-induced Ag nanocluster nucleation in silicate glasses:
  analogy with photography","The synthesis of Ag nanoclusters in sodalime silicate glasses and silica was
studied by optical absorption (OA) and electron spin resonance (ESR)
experiments under both low (gamma-ray) and high (MeV ion) deposited energy
density irradiation conditions. Both types of irradiation create electrons and
holes whose density and thermal evolution - notably via their interaction with
defects - are shown to determine the clustering and growth rates of Ag
nanocrystals. We thus establish the influence of redox interactions of defects
and silver (poly)ions. The mechanisms are similar to the latent image formation
in photography: irradiation-induced photoelectrons are trapped within the glass
matrix, notably on dissolved noble metal ions and defects, which are thus
neutralized (reverse oxidation reactions are also shown to exist). Annealing
promotes metal atom diffusion, which in turn leads to cluster nuclei formation.
The cluster density depends not only on the irradiation fluence, but also - and
primarily - on the density of deposited energy and the redox properties of the
glass. Ion irradiation (i.e., large deposited energy density) is far more
effective in cluster formation, despite its lower neutralization efficiency
(from Ag+ to Ag0) as compared to gamma photon irradiation.",2007-03-20T10:02:57Z
"Activity patterns on random scale-free networks: Global dynamics arising
  from local majority rules","Activity or spin patterns on random scale-free network are studied by mean
field analysis and computer simulations. These activity patterns evolve in time
according to local majority-rule dynamics which is implemented using (i)
parallel or synchronous updating and (ii) random sequential or asynchronous
updating. Our mean-field calculations predict that the relaxation processes of
disordered activity patterns become much more efficient as the scaling exponent
$\gamma$ of the scale-free degree distribution changes from $\gamma >5/2$ to
$\gamma < 5/2$. For $\gamma > 5/2$, the corresponding decay times increase as
$\ln(N)$ with increasing network size $N$ whereas they are independent of $N$
for $\gamma < 5/2$. In order to check these mean field predictions, extensive
simulations of the pattern dynamics have been performed using two different
ensembles of random scale-free networks: (A) multi-networks as generated by the
configuration method, which typically leads to many self-connections and
multiple edges, and (B) simple-networks without self-connections and multiple
edges.",2007-01-18T08:20:52Z
"Comparative study of unscreened and screened molecular static linear
  polarizability in the Hartree-Fock, hybrid-density functional, and density
  functional models","The sum-over-states (SOS) polarizabilities are calculated within the
approximate independent electron theories such as the Hartree-Fock
approximation and density functional models using the eigenvalues and orbitals
obtained from the self-consistent solution of single-particle equations. The
SOS polarizabilities are then compared with those calculated using the
finite-field method within three widely used single particle models: (1) the
Hartree-Fock (HF) method, (2) the three parameter hybrid generalized gradient
approximation (B3LYP), and (3) the parameter free generalized gradient
approximation due to Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE). The comparison is carried
out for polarizabilities of 142 molecules calculated using the 6-311++G(d,p)
orbital basis at the geometries optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G** level. The
results show that the SOS method almost always overestimate the FF
polarizabilities in the PBE and B3LYP models. This trend is reversed in the HF
method however exception to the trend do exist. The mean absolute errors (MAE)
in the screened (FF) and unscreened (SOS) polarizability are 0.78 \AA$^3$ for
the HF method, 1.87 \AA$^3$ for the B3LYP, and 3.44 \AA$^3$ for the PBE-GGA.
The Hartree-Fock approximation predicts finite-field polarizabilities that are
smaller than those predicted by the PBE and B3LYP models. Finally, a simple
scheme is devised to obtain FF quality estimate of polarizability from those
obtained using the SOS method by exploiting the observed trends.",2007-01-19T00:36:58Z
Proposed low energy model Hamiltonian for spin-gapped system CuTe2O5,"Using first-principles electronic structure calculations based on the Nth
order muffin tin orbital (NMTO)-downfolding technique, we derived the
low-energy spin model for CuTe2O5. Our study reveals that this compound is a 2D
coupled spin-dimer system with the strongest Cu-Cu interaction mediated by two
O-Te-O bridges. We checked the goodness of our model by computing the magnetic
susceptibility with the Quantum Monte Carlo technique and by comparing it with
available experimental data. We also present magnetization and specific heat
results which may be compared with future experimental investigations. Our
derived model is in disagreement with a recently proposed model for this
compound [J. Deisenhofer et al, Phys. Rev. B,74 (2006) 174421]. The situation
needs to be settled in terms of further experimental investigations.",2007-03-26T13:13:29Z
"Griffiths singularities and algebraic order in the exact solution of an
  Ising model on a fractal modular network","We use an exact renormalization-group transformation to study the Ising model
on a complex network composed of tightly-knit communities nested hierarchically
with the fractal scaling recently discovered in a variety of real-world
networks. Varying the ratio K/J of of inter- to intra-community coupling, we
obtain an unusual phase diagram: at high temperatures or small K/J we have a
disordered phase with a Griffiths singularity in the free energy, due to the
presence of rare large clusters, which we analyze through the Yang-Lee zeros in
the complex magnetic field plane. As the temperature is lowered, true
long-range order is not seen, but there is a transition to algebraic order,
where pair correlations have power-law decay with distance, reminiscent of the
XY model. The transition is infinite-order at small K/J, and becomes
second-order above a threshold value (K/J)_m. The existence of such slowly
decaying correlations is unexpected in a fat-tailed scale-free network, where
correlations longer than nearest-neighbor are typically suppressed.",2007-01-15T20:18:48Z
"Interaction of plane gravitational waves with a Fabry-Perot cavity in
  the local Lorentz frame","We analyze the interaction of plane '+'-polarized gravitational waves with a
Fabry-Perot cavity in the local Lorentz frame of the cavity input mirror
outside of the range of long-wave approximation with the force of radiation
pressure taken into account. The obtained detector response signal is
represented as a sum of two parts: (i) the phase shift due to displacement of
the movable mirror under the influence of gravitational wave and the force of
light pressure, and (ii) the phase shift due to direct interaction of
gravitational wave with light wave inside the cavity. We obtain formula for the
movable mirror law of motion paying close attention to the phenomena of optical
rigidity, radiative friction and direct coupling of gravitational wave to light
wave. Some issues concerning the detection of high-frequency gravitational
waves and the role of optical rigidity in it are discussed. We also examine in
detail special cases of optical resonance and small detuning from it and
compare our results with the known ones.",2007-01-29T09:04:02Z
Confined coherence in quasi-one-dimensional metals,"We present a functional renormalization group calculation of the effect of
strong interactions on the shape of the Fermi surface of weakly coupled
metallic chains. In the regime where the bare interchain hopping is small, we
show that scattering processes involving large momentum transfers perpendicular
to the chains can completely destroy the warping of the true Fermi surface,
leading to a confined state where the renormalized interchain hopping vanishes
and a coherent motion perpendicular to the chains is impossible.",2007-03-21T08:57:08Z
A well-tempered density functional theory of electrons in molecules,"Reporting extensions of a recently developed approach to density functional
theory with correct long-range be-havior (Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 043002 (2005)).
The central quantities are a splitting functional gamma[n] and a complementary
exchange-correlation functional. We give a practical method for determining the
value of \gamma in molecules, assuming an approximation for XC energy is given.
The resulting theory shows good ability to reproduce the ionization potentials
for various molecules. However it is not of sufficient accuracy for forming a
satisfactory framework for studying molecular properties. A somewhat different
approach is then adopted, which depends on a density-independent \gamma and an
additional parameter w eliminating part of the local exchange functional. The
values of these two parameters are obtained by best-fitting to experimental
atomization energies and bond-lengths of the molecules in the G2(1) database.
The optimized values are gamma=0.5 a_0^{-1} and w=0.1 . We then examine the
performance of this slightly semi-empirical functional for a variety of
molecular properties, comparing to related works and to experiment. We show
that this approach can be used for describing in a satisfactory manner a broad
range of molecular properties, be they static or dynamic. Most satisfactory is
the ability to describe valence, Rydberg and inter-molecular charge-transfer
excitations.",2007-01-20T07:32:25Z
"Star Counts in the Globular Cluster Omega Centauri. I. Bright Stellar
  Components","We present an extensive photometry on HB, RGB, and MSTO stars in Omega Cen.
The central regions of the cluster were covered with a mosaic of F435W, F625W,
and F658N-band data collected with ACS/HST. The outer reaches were covered with
a large set of U,B,V,I-band data collected with the WFI@2.2m ESO/MPI telescope.
The final catalogue includes ~1.7 million stars. We identified ~3,200 likely HB
stars and ~12,500 stars brighter than the subgiant branch and fainter than the
RGB bumps. The HB morphology changes with the radial distance. The relative
number of extreme HB stars decreases from ~30% to ~21% when moving from the
center toward the outer regions of the cluster, while the fraction of less hot
HB stars increases from ~62% to ~72%. We performed a detailed comparison
between observed ratios of different stellar tracers and predictions based on
canonical evolutionary models with a primordial helium (Y=0.23) content and
metal abundances (Z=0.0002,0.001) that bracket the observed spread in
metallicity of Omega Cen stars. We found that the empirical star counts of HB
stars are on average larger (30%-40%) than predicted. Moreover, the rate of HB
stars is 43% larger than the MSTO rate. The discrepancy between the rate of HB
compared with the rate of RG and MSTO stars supports the evidence that we are
facing a true excess of HB stars. The same comparison was performed by assuming
a mix of stellar populations made with 70% of canonical stars and 30% of
He-enhanced stars. The discrepancy between theory and observations decreases by
a factor of two when compared with rates predicted by canonical He content
models, but still 15%-25% (Y=0.42) and 15%-20% (Y=0.33) higher than observed.
Furthermore, the ratio between HB and MSTO star counts are ~24% (Y=0.42) and
30% (Y=0.33) larger than predicted lifetime ratios.",2007-03-15T17:46:49Z

"Possibility of magnetic field induced Composite Fermi sea in neutral
  Graphene","Neutral graphene in strong magnetic fields is believed to be an (exchange
stabilized) integer Hall state of completely filled up spin (say) and empty
down spin bands of n = 0, two fold valley degenerate Landau levels. We suggest
that correlation energy gain from a nearly SU(4) singlet (2 spin $\times$ 2
valley) composite fermi sea formation, at $\nu \approx$ \hlf filling for each
component, destabilizes ferromagnetic integer quantum Hall state. This
radically different scenario is consistent with a dissipative gapless state
seen in experiments in neutral graphene. Interesting paired Hall states are
possible, from residual interactions, in this SU(4) fermi sea with a small
Zeeman spin polarization.",2007-02-18T12:29:41Z
Size distribution and structure of Barchan dune fields,"Barchans are isolated mobile dunes often organized in large dune fields. Dune
fields seem to present a characteristic dune size and spacing, which suggests a
cooperative behavior based on dune interaction. In Duran et al. (2009), we
propose that the redistribution of sand by collisions between dunes is a key
element for the stability and size selection of barchan dune fields. This
approach was based on a mean-field model ignoring the spatial distribution of
dune fields. Here, we present a simplified dune field model that includes the
spatial evolution of individual dunes as well as their interaction through sand
exchange and binary collisions. As a result, the dune field evolves towards a
steady state that depends on the boundary conditions. Comparing our results
with measurements of Moroccan dune fields, we find that the simulated fields
have the same dune size distribution as in real fields but fail to reproduce
their homogeneity along the wind direction.",2007-01-16T10:37:22Z
"Effective medium theories for irregular fluffy structures: aggregation
  of small particles","We study the extinction efficiencies as well as scattering properties of
particles of different porosity. Calculations are performed for porous
pseudospheres with small size (Rayleigh) inclusions using the discrete dipole
approximation. Five refractive indices of materials covering the range from
$1.20+0.00i$ to $1.75+0.58i$ were selected. They correspond to biological
particles, dirty ice, silicate, amorphous carbon and soot in the visual part of
spectrum. We attempt to describe the optical properties of such particles using
Lorenz-Mie theory and a refractive index found from some effective medium
theory (EMT) assuming the particle is homogeneous. We refer to this as the
effective model.
  It is found that the deviations are minimal when utilizing the EMT based on
the Bruggeman mixing rule. Usually the deviations in extinction factor do not
exceed $\sim 5%$ for particle porosity ${\cal P}=0 - 0.9$ and size parameters
$x_{\rm porous} = 2 \pi r_{\rm s, porous}/\lambda \la 25$. The deviations are
larger for scattering and absorption efficiencies and smaller for particle
albedo and asymmetry parameter. Our calculations made for spheroids confirm
these conclusions. Preliminary consideration shows that the effective model
represents the intensity and polarization of radiation scattered by fluffy
aggregates quite well. Thus, the effective models of spherical and
non-spherical particles can be used to significantly simplify computations of
the optical properties of aggregates containing only Rayleigh inclusions.",2007-03-01T16:31:46Z
Portraits of Complex Networks,"We propose a method for characterizing large complex networks by introducing
a new matrix structure, unique for a given network, which encodes structural
information; provides useful visualization, even for very large networks; and
allows for rigorous statistical comparison between networks. Dynamic processes
such as percolation can be visualized using animations. Applications to graph
theory are discussed, as are generalizations to weighted networks, real-world
network similarity testing, and applicability to the graph isomorphism problem.",2007-03-19T18:57:45Z

On the robustness of the h-index,"The h-index (Hirsch, 2005) is robust, remaining relatively unaffected by
errors in the long tails of the citations-rank distribution, such as
typographic errors that short-change frequently-cited papers and create bogus
additional records. This robustness, and the ease with which h-indices can be
verified, support the use of a Hirsch-type index over alternatives such as the
journal impact factor. These merits of the h-index apply to both individuals
and to journals.",2007-01-11T00:48:45Z
Improving Prolog programs: Refactoring for Prolog,"Refactoring is an established technique from the object-oriented (OO)
programming community to restructure code: it aims at improving software
readability, maintainability and extensibility. Although refactoring is not
tied to the OO-paradigm in particular, its ideas have not been applied to Logic
Programming until now.
  This paper applies the ideas of refactoring to Prolog programs. A catalogue
is presented listing refactorings classified according to scope. Some of the
refactorings have been adapted from the OO-paradigm, while others have been
specifically designed for Prolog. The discrepancy between intended and
operational semantics in Prolog is also addressed by some of the refactorings.
  In addition, ViPReSS, a semi-automatic refactoring browser, is discussed and
the experience with applying ViPReSS to a large Prolog legacy system is
reported. The main conclusion is that refactoring is both a viable technique in
Prolog and a rather desirable one.",2007-02-14T09:53:37Z
A model for cage formation in colloidal suspension of laponite,"In this paper we investigate glass transition in aqueous suspension of
synthetic hectorite clay, laponite. We believe that upon dispersing laponite
clay in water, system comprises of clusters (agglomerates) of laponite
dispersed in the same. Subsequent osmotic swelling of these clusters leads to
increase in their volume fraction. We propose that this phenomenon is
responsible for slowing down of the overall dynamics of the system. As clusters
fill up the space, system undergoes glass transition. Along with the mode
coupling theory, proposed mechanism rightly captures various characteristic
features of the system in the ergodic regime as it approaches glass transition.",2007-02-20T16:10:07Z
Exciting a d-density wave in an optical lattice with driven tunneling,"Quantum phases with unusual symmetries may play a key role for the
understanding of solid state systems at low temperatures. We propose a
realistic scenario, well in reach of present experimental techniques, which
should permit to produce a stationary quantum state with $d_{x^2-y^2}$-symmetry
in a two-dimensional bosonic optical square lattice. This state, characterized
by alternating rotational flux in each plaquette, arises from driven tunneling
implemented by a stimulated Raman scattering process. We discuss bosons in a
square lattice, however, more complex systems involving other lattice
geometries appear possible.",2007-03-26T17:57:36Z
"Extreme value problems in Random Matrix Theory and other disordered
  systems","We review some applications of central limit theorems and extreme values
statistics in the context of disordered systems. We discuss several problems,
in particular concerning Random Matrix Theory and the generalisation of the
Tracy-Widom distribution when the disorder has ``fat tails''. We underline the
relevance of power-law tails for Directed Polymers and mean-field Spin Glasses,
and we point out various open problems and conjectures on these matters. We
find that in many instances the assumption of Gaussian disorder cannot be taken
for granted.",2007-02-09T16:00:12Z
Gauge Field Formulation of Adiabatic Spin Torques,"Previous calculation of spin torques for small-amplitude magnetization
dynamics around a uniformly magnetized state [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 75}
(2006) 113706] is extended here to the case of finite-amplitude dynamics. This
is achieved by introducing an `` adiabatic'' spin frame for conduction
electrons, and the associated SU(2) gauge field. In particular, the Gilbert
damping is shown to arise from the time variation of the spin-relaxation source
terms in this new frame, giving a new physical picture of the damping. The
present method will allow a `` first-principle'' derivation of spin torques
without any assumptions such as rotational symmetry in spin space.",2007-03-27T10:03:01Z
DNA double helices for single molecule electronics,"The combination of self-assembly and electronic properties as well as its
true nanoscale dimensions make DNA a promising candidate for a building block
of single molecule electronics. We argue that the intrinsic double helix
conformation of the DNA strands provides a possibility to drive the electric
current through the DNA by the perpendicular electric (gating) field. The
transistor effect in the poly(G)-poly(C) synthetic DNA is demonstrated within a
simple model approach. We put forward experimental setups to observe the
predicted effect and discuss possible device applications of DNA. In
particular, we propose a design of the single molecule analog of the Esaki
diode.",2007-03-09T13:24:19Z
Heat transport in giant (exo)planets: a new perspective,"We explore the possibility that large-scale convection be inhibited over some
regions of giant planet interiors, as a consequence of a gradient of
composition inherited either from their formation history or from particular
events like giant impacts or core erosion during their evolution. Under
appropriate circumstances, the redistribution of the gradient of molecular
weight can lead to double diffusive layered or overstable convection. This
leads to much less efficient heat transport and compositional mixing than
large-scale adiabatic convection. We show that this process can explain the
abnormally large radius of the transit planet HD209458b and similar objects,
and may be at play in some giant planets, with short-period planets offering
the most favorable conditions. Observational signatures of this transport
mechanism are a large radius and a reduced heat flux output compared with
uniformly mixed objects. If our suggestion is correct, it bears major
consequences on our understanding of giant planet formation, structure and
evolution, including possibly our own jovian planets.",2007-03-29T11:15:45Z
"Analysis of Sequential Decoding Complexity Using the Berry-Esseen
  Inequality","his study presents a novel technique to estimate the computational complexity
of sequential decoding using the Berry-Esseen theorem. Unlike the theoretical
bounds determined by the conventional central limit theorem argument, which
often holds only for sufficiently large codeword length, the new bound obtained
from the Berry-Esseen theorem is valid for any blocklength. The accuracy of the
new bound is then examined for two sequential decoding algorithms, an
ordering-free variant of the generalized Dijkstra's algorithm (GDA)(or
simplified GDA) and the maximum-likelihood sequential decoding algorithm
(MLSDA). Empirically investigating codes of small blocklength reveals that the
theoretical upper bound for the simplified GDA almost matches the simulation
results as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per information bit ($\gamma_b$) is
greater than or equal to 8 dB. However, the theoretical bound may become
markedly higher than the simulated average complexity when $\gamma_b$ is small.
For the MLSDA, the theoretical upper bound is quite close to the simulation
results for both high SNR ($\gamma_b\geq 6$ dB) and low SNR ($\gamma_b\leq 2$
dB). Even for moderate SNR, the simulation results and the theoretical bound
differ by at most \makeblue{0.8} on a $\log_{10}$ scale.",2007-01-05T01:07:16Z
"Sequential decoding for lossless streaming source coding with side
  information","The problem of lossless fixed-rate streaming coding of discrete memoryless
sources with side information at the decoder is studied. A random time-varying
tree-code is used to sequentially bin strings and a Stack Algorithm with a
variable bias uses the side information to give a delay-universal coding system
for lossless source coding with side information. The scheme is shown to give
exponentially decaying probability of error with delay, with exponent equal to
Gallager's random coding exponent for sources with side information. The mean
of the random variable of computation for the stack decoder is bounded, and
conditions on the bias are given to guarantee a finite $\rho^{th}$ moment for
$0 \leq \rho \leq 1$.
  Further, the problem is also studied in the case where there is a discrete
memoryless channel between encoder and decoder. The same scheme is slightly
modified to give a joint-source channel encoder and Stack Algorithm-based
sequential decoder using side information. Again, by a suitable choice of bias,
the probability of error decays exponentially with delay and the random
variable of computation has a finite mean. Simulation results for several
examples are given.",2007-03-23T17:58:27Z
Non-Planck equilibrium radiation in plasma model of early Universe,"Consideration of the adiabatic character of radiation expansion in early
Universe leads to the conclusion that equilibrium distribution of the
primordial radiation in the presence of charged particles could be different
from the Planck distribution in some regions of the spectrum. The equilibrium
distribution of electromagnetic radiation (the black body radiation) is
generalized for the system containing an extremely dense fully ionized plasma.
The conditions of the adiabatic expansion of radiation for the model of the
early Universe are found.",2007-03-22T09:07:54Z
"Nonequilibrium functional renormalization group for interacting quantum
  systems","We propose a nonequilibrium version of functional renormalization within the
Keldysh formalism by introducing a complex valued flow parameter in the Fermi
or Bose functions of each reservoir. Our cutoff scheme provides a unified
approach to equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations. We apply it to
nonequilibrium transport through an interacting quantum wire coupled to two
reservoirs and show that the nonequilibrium occupation induces new power law
exponents for the conductance.",2007-02-21T14:48:16Z
"Evolution of a quantum spin system to its ground state: Role of
  entanglement and interaction symmetry","We study the decoherence of two ferro- and antiferromagnetically coupled
spins that interact with a frustrated spin-bath environment in its ground
state. The conditions under which the two-spin system relaxes from the initial
spin-up - spin-down state towards its ground state are determined. It is shown
that the two-spin system relaxes to its ground state for narrow ranges of the
model parameters only. It is demonstrated that the symmetry of the coupling
between the two-spin system and the environment has an important effect on the
relaxation process. In particular, we show that if this coupling conserves the
magnetization, the two-spin system readily relaxes to its ground state whereas
a non-conserving coupling prevents the two-spin system from coming close to its
ground state.",2007-01-19T23:07:29Z
"High Resolution Photoemission Study on Low-T_K Ce Systems: Kondo
  Resonance, Crystal Field Structures, and their Temperature Dependence","We present a high-resolution photoemission study on the strongly correlated
Ce-compounds CeCu_6, CeCu_2Si_2, CeRu_2Si_2, CeNi_2Ge_2, and CeSi_2. Using a
normalization procedure based on a division by the Fermi-Dirac distribution we
get access to the spectral density of states up to an energy of 5 k_BT above
the Fermi energy E_F. Thus we can resolve the Kondo resonance and the crystal
field (CF) fine-structure for different temperatures above and around the Kondo
temperature T_K. The CF peaks are identified with multiple Kondo resonances
within the multiorbital Anderson impurity model. Our theoretical 4f spectra,
calculated from an extended non-crossing approximation (NCA), describe
consistently the observed photoemission features and their temperature
dependence. By fitting the NCA spectra to the experimental data and
extrapolating the former to low temperatures, T_K can be extracted
quantitatively. The resulting values for T_K and the crystal field energies are
in excellent agreement with the results from bulk sensitive measurements, e.g.
inelastic neutron scattering.",2007-02-15T13:44:17Z
A link between ECM plasticity and synaptic morphological evolution,"We made a link between Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM) plasticity and the

"Competing antiferroelectric and ferroelectric interactions in NaNbO3 :
  Neutron diffraction and theoretical studies","Neutron diffraction studies using powder samples have been used to understand
the complex sequence of low temperature phase transitions of NaNbO3 in the
temperature range from 12 K-350 K. Detailed Rietveld analysis of the
diffraction data reveal that the antiferroelectric to ferroelectric phase
transition occurs on cooling around 73 K while the reverse ferroelectric to
antiferroelectric transition occurs on heating at 245 K. However, the former
transformation is not complete till down to 12 K and there is unambiguous
evidence for the presence of the ferroelectric R3c phase coexisting with an
antiferroelectic phase (Pbcm) over a wide range of temperatures. The coexisting
phases and reported anomalous smearing of the dielectric response akin to
dipole glasses and relaxors observed in the same temperature range are
consistent with competing ferroelectric and antiferroelectric interactions in
NaNbO3. We have carried out theoretical lattice dynamical calculations which
reveal that the free energies of the antiferroelectric Pbcm and ferroelectric
R3c phases are nearly identical over a wide range of temperature. The small
energy difference between the two phases is of interest as it explains the
observed coexistence of these phases over a wide range of temperature. The
computed double well depths and energy barriers from paraelectric Pm m to
antiferroelectric Pbcm and ferroelectric R3c phases in NaNbO3 are also quite
similar, although the ferroelectric R3c phase has a slightly lower energy.",2007-03-14T09:13:09Z
Covariant Description of the Inhomogeneous Mixmaster Chaos,"We outline the covariant nature of the chaos characterizing the generic
cosmological solution near the initial singularity. Our analysis is based on a
""gauge"" independent ADM-reduction of the dynamics to the physical degrees of
freedom, and shows that the dynamics is isomorphic point by point in space to a
billiard on a Lobachevsky plane. The Jacobi metric associated to the geodesic
flow is constructed and a non-zero Lyapunov exponent is explicitly calculated.
The chaos covariance emerges from the independence of the form of the lapse
function and the shift vector.",2007-01-16T14:22:37Z
"Superconducting critical temperature and singlet and triplet pair
  functions of superconductor/normal-metal/ferromagnet trilayers","We calculate the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, the singlet pair
function $\Psi^+(x)$, and triplet pair function $\Psi^-(x)$ of
superconductor/normal metal/ferromagnet (S/N/F) trilayers using the linearized
Usadel equation near $T_c$. The Green's function method developed by Fominov
$et al.$ for the S/F bilayers is extended to the S/N/F trilayer systems. The S
of the trilayers is taken to be an s-wave singlet pairing superconductor, and
the S/N and N/F interfaces are modeled in terms of the interface resistances
parameterized, respectively, by $\gamma_b^{SN}$ and $\gamma_b^{NF}$. We present
the $T_c$, $\Psi^+(x)$, and $\Psi^-(x)$ for typical $\gamma_b^{SN}$,
$\gamma_b^{NF}$, and the exchange energy $ E_{ex}$: (a) For a small (large)
$\gamma_b^{NF}$, $T_c$ of S/N/F trilayers, as $d_N$ is increased, increases
(decreases) on the length scale of N coherence length $\xi_N$ with a
discontinuity at $d_N=0$ due to a boundary condition mismatch. (b) $T_c(d_F)$
shows a non-monotonic behavior like S/F bilayers with a weakened shallow dip.
(c) The odd frequency triplet component $\Psi^-(x)$, induced by $E_{ex}$ and
proximity effects, has a maximum near the N/F interface and decreases on the
length scale $\xi_{ex}$ in F. It also penetrates into N and S regions on the
length scale $\xi_N$ and $\xi_S$, respectively. Based on these results we make
comments on the experimental observation of the odd triplet components and the
recent $T_c$ measurements in Nb/Au/CoFe trilayer systems.",2007-01-29T10:05:29Z
Dynamical correlation functions of the XXZ model at finite temperature,"Combining a lattice path integral formulation for thermodynamics with the
solution of the quantum inverse scattering problem for local spin operators, we
derive a multiple integral representation for the time-dependent longitudinal
correlation function of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain at finite temperature
and in an external magnetic field. Our formula reproduces the previous results
in the following three limits: the static, the zero-temperature and the XY
limits.",2007-03-13T02:06:41Z
"Conditional statistics of electron transport in interacting nanoscale
  conductors","Interactions between nanoscale semiconductor structures form the basis for
charge detectors in the solid state. Recent experimental advances have
demonstrated the on-chip detection of single electron transport through a
quantum dot (QD). The discreteness of charge in units of e leads to intrinsic
fluctuations in the electrical current, known as shot noise. To measure these
single-electron fluctuations a nearby coherent conductor, called a quantum
point contact (QPC), interacts with the QD and acts as a detector. An important
property of the QPC charge detector is noninvasiveness: the system physically
affects the detector, not visa-versa. Here we predict that even for ideal
noninvasive detectors such as the QPC, when a particular detector result is
observed, the system suffers an informational backaction, radically altering
the statistics of transport through the QD as compared to the unconditional
shot noise. We develop a theoretical model to make predictions about the joint
current probability distributions and conditional transport statistics. The
experimental findings reported here demonstrate the reality of informational
backaction in nanoscale systems as well as a variety of new effects, such as
conditional noise enhancement, which are in essentially perfect agreement with
our model calculations. This type of switching telegraph process occurs
abundantly in nature, indicating that these results are applicable to a wide
variety of systems.",2007-01-29T21:50:50Z
Optical phase shifts and diabolic topology in Mobius-type strips,"We compute the optical phase shifts between the left and the right-circularly
polarized light after it traverses non-planar cyclic paths described by the
boundary curves of closed twisted strips. The evolution of the electric field
along the curved path of a light ray is described by the Fermi-Walker transport
law which is mapped to a Schr\""{o}dinger equation. The effective quantum
Hamiltonian of the system has eigenvalues equal to $0, \pm \kappa$, where
$\kappa$ is the local curvature of the path. The inflexion points of the
twisted strips correspond to the vanishing of the curvature and manifest
themselves as the diabolic crossings of the quantum Hamiltonian. For the
M\""{o}bius loops, the critical width where the diabolic geometry resides also
corresponds to the characteristic width where the optical phase shift is
minimal. In our detailed study of various twisted strips, this intriguing
property singles out the M""{o}bius geometry.",2007-01-17T01:14:07Z
"Van der Waals density functional: Self-consistent potential and the
  nature of the van der Waals bond","We derive the exchange-correlation potential corresponding to the nonlocal
van der Waals density functional [M. Dion, H. Rydberg, E. Schroder, D. C.
Langreth, and B. I. Lundqvist, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. We use this
potential for a self-consistent calculation of the ground state properties of a
number of van der Waals complexes as well as crystalline silicon. For the
latter, where little or no van der Waals interaction is expected, we find that
the results are mostly determined by semilocal exchange and correlation as in
standard generalized gradient approximations (GGA), with the fully nonlocal
term giving little effect. On the other hand, our results for the van der Waals
complexes show that the self-consistency has little effect at equilibrium
separations. This finding validates previous calculations with the same
functional that treated the fully nonlocal term as a post GGA perturbation. A
comparison of our results with wave-function calculations demonstrates the
usefulness of our approach. The exchange-correlation potential also allows us
to calculate Hellmann-Feynman forces, hence providing the means for efficient
geometry relaxations as well as unleashing the potential use of other standard
techniques that depend on the self-consistent charge distribution. The nature
of the van der Waals bond is discussed in terms of the self-consistent bonding
charge.",2007-03-16T16:24:01Z
"Transfer-matrix renormalization group study of the spin ladders with
  cyclic four-spin interactions","The temperature dependence of the specific heat and spin susceptibility of
the spin ladders with cyclic four-spin interactions in the rung-singlet phase
is explored by making use of the transfer-matrix renormalization group method.
The values of spin gap are extracted from the specific heat and susceptibility,
respectively. It is found that for different relative strength between
interchain and intrachain interactions, the spin gap is approximately linear
with the cyclic four-spin interaction in the region far away from the critical
point. Furthermore, we show that the dispersion for the one-triplet magnon
branch can be obtained by numerically fitting on the partition function.",2007-01-11T14:05:53Z
"Superlattices Consisting of ""Lines"" of Adsorbed Hydrogen Atom Pairs on
  Graphene","The structures and electron properties of new superlattices formed on
graphene by adsorbed hydrogen molecules are theoretically described. It has
been shown that superlattices of the (n, 0) zigzag type with linearly arranged
pairs of H atoms have band structures similar to the spectra of (n, 0) carbon
nanotubes. At the same time, superlattices of the (n, n) type with a
""staircase"" of adsorbed pairs of H atoms are substantially metallic with a high
density of electronic states at the Fermi level and this property distinguishes
their spectra from the spectra of the corresponding (n, n) nanotubes. The
features of the spectra have the Van Hove form, which is characteristic of each
individual superlattice. The possibility of using such planar structures with
nanometer thickness is discussed.",2007-03-09T19:52:48Z
Dust properties at z=6.3 in the host galaxy of GRB 050904,"We investigate the dust extinction properties in the host galaxy of the
Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) GRB 050904 at z=6.29 by analyzing simultaneous broad band
observations of the optical and UV afterglow at three different epochs. We show
that the peculiar afterglow spectral energy distribution (SED) observed at 0.5
days and at 1 day after the burst (1.6 and 3 hours rest frame) cannot be
explained with dust reddening with any of the extinction curves observed at low
redshift. Yet, the extinction curve recently inferred for the most distant BAL
QSO at z=6.2 nicely reproduces the SED of GRB 050904 at both epochs. Our result
provides an additional, independent indication that the properties of dust
evolve beyond z~6. We discuss the implications of this finding within the
context of the dust production mechanisms through the cosmic ages.",2007-03-14T09:21:24Z
Bose glass and superfuid phases of cavity polaritons,"We report the calculation of cavity exciton-polariton phase diagram which
takes into account the presence of realistic structural disorder. Polaritons
are modelled as weakly interacting two-dimensional bosons. We show that with
increasing density polaritons first undergo a quasi-phase transition towards a
Bose glass: the condensate is localized in at least one minimum of the disorder
potential, depending on the value of the chemical potential of the polariton
system. A further increase of the density leads to a percolation process of the
polariton fluid which gives rise to a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition
towards superfluidity. The spatial representation of the condensate
wavefunction as well as the spectrum of elementary excitations are obtained
from the solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for all the phases.",2007-01-29T14:54:17Z
Recovering Metallicity in A4C60: The Case of Monomeric Li4C60,"The restoration of metallicity in the high-temperature, cubic phase of Li4C60
represents a remarkable feature for a member of the A4C60 family (A = alkali
metal), invariably found to be insulators. Structural and resonance technique
investigations on Li4C60 at T > 600 K, show that its fcc structure is
associated with a complete (4e) charge transfer to C60 and a sparsely populated
Fermi level. These findings not only emphasize the crucial role played by
lattice symmetry in fulleride transport properties, but also re-dimension the
role of Jahn-Teller effects in band structure determination. Moreover, they
suggest the present system as a potential precursor to a new class of
superconducting fullerides.",2007-01-15T10:15:06Z
XXX Spin Chain: from Bethe Solution to Open Problems,"We present some open problems in the field of exactly solvable models. Two of

Vortex quasi-crystals in mesoscopic superconducting samples,"There seems to be a one to one correspondence between the phases of atomic
and molecular matter (AMOM) and vortex matter (VM) in superfluids and
superconductors. Crystals, liquids and glasses have been experimentally
observed in both AMOM and VM. Here, we propose a vortex quasi-crystal state
which can be stabilized due to boundary and surface energy effects for samples
of special shapes and sizes. For finite sized pentagonal samples, it is
proposed that a phase transition between a vortex crystal and a vortex
quasi-crystal occurs as a function of magnetic field and temperature as the
sample size is reduced.",2007-03-15T17:56:25Z
Ultrafast Vortex-Core Reversal Dynamics in Ferromagnetic Nanodots,"To verify the exact underlying mechanism of ultrafast vortex-core reversal as
well as the vortex state stability we conducted numerical calculations of the
dynamic evolution of magnetic vortices in Permalloy cylindrical nanodots under
an oscillating in-plane magnetic field over a wide range of the frequency and
amplitude. The calculated results reveal different kinds of the non-trivial
dynamic responses of vortices to the driving external field. In particular, the
results offer insight into the 10 ps scale underlying physics of the ulrafast
vortex-core reversals driven by small amplitude (~10 Oe) in-plane fields. This
work also provides fundamentals of how to manipulate effectively the dynamical
switching of the vortex-core orientation.",2007-03-21T05:03:20Z
An introduction to the polaron and bipolaron theoretical concepts,"A simple model for the autolocalization of a free charged particle is
presented. The polarization well in the model is deep enough for only one
localized level. In dielectric materials with a sufficiently large dielectric
constant, two charged identical particles can be localized in one polarization
potential well, forming a bipolaron. Although several localized levels can be
found in more realistic self-consistent models of this type, the more realistic
theories require a high level of knowledge of mathematics. Hence, the proposed
model can serve as an introduction to the ideas and concepts of autolocalized
states.",2007-02-10T14:55:53Z
"Tunneling through magnetic molecules with arbitrary angle between easy
  axis and magnetic field","Inelastic tunneling through magnetically anisotropic molecules is studied
theoretically in the presence of a strong magnetic field. Since the molecular
orientation is not well controlled in tunneling experiments, we consider
arbitrary angles between easy axis and field. This destroys all conservation
laws except that of charge, leading to a rich fine structure in the
differential conductance. Besides single molecules we also study monolayers of
molecules with either aligned or random easy axes. We show that detailed
information on the molecular transitions and orientations can be obtained from
the differential conductance for varying magnetic field. For random easy axes,
averaging over orientations leads to van Hove singularities in the differential
conductance. Rate equations in the sequential-tunneling approximation are
employed. An efficient approximation for their solution for complex molecules
is presented. The results are applied to Mn12-based magnetic molecules.",2007-02-08T17:12:06Z
"Air-shower simulations with and without thinning: artificial
  fluctuations and their suppression","The most common way to simplify extensive Monte-Carlo simulations of air
showers is to use the thinning approximation. We study its effect on the
physical parameters reconstructed from simulated showers. To this end, we have
created a library of showers simulated without thinning with energies from
10^17 eV to 10^18 eV, various zenith angles and primaries. This library is
publicly available. Physically interesting applications of the showers
simulated without thinning are discussed. Observables reconstructed from these
showers are compared to those obtained with the thinning approximation. The
amount of artificial fluctuations introduced by thinning is estimated. A simple
method, multisampling, is suggested which results in a controllable suppression
of artificial fluctuations and at the same time requires less demanding
computational resources as compared to the usual thinning.",2007-03-21T06:11:54Z
"Structure and heat capacity of Ne and Xe adsorbed on a bundle of carbon

Universal Algorithmic Intelligence: A mathematical top->down approach,"Sequential decision theory formally solves the problem of rational agents in
uncertain worlds if the true environmental prior probability distribution is
known. Solomonoff's theory of universal induction formally solves the problem
of sequence prediction for unknown prior distribution. We combine both ideas
and get a parameter-free theory of universal Artificial Intelligence. We give
strong arguments that the resulting AIXI model is the most intelligent unbiased
agent possible. We outline how the AIXI model can formally solve a number of
problem classes, including sequence prediction, strategic games, function
minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The major drawback of the
AIXI model is that it is uncomputable. To overcome this problem, we construct a
modified algorithm AIXItl that is still effectively more intelligent than any
other time t and length l bounded agent. The computation time of AIXItl is of
the order t x 2^l. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence
order relations, the horizon problem and relations of the AIXI theory to other
AI approaches.",2007-01-20T00:18:06Z
Magnetoelectric coupling in epitaxial orthorhombic YMnO3 thin films,"We have grown epitaxial thin-films of the orthorhombic phase of YMnO3 oxide
on Nb:SrTiO3(001) substrates and their structure, magnetic and dielectric
response have been measured. We have found that a substrate-induced strain
produces an in-plane compression of the YMnO3 unit cell. The
temperature-dependent magnetization curves display a significant ZFC-FC
hysteresis at temperatures below the Neel temperature (TN around 40K). The
dielectric constant increases gradually (up to 26%) below TN and mimics the ZFC
magnetization curve. We argue that these effects are a manifestation of
magnetoelectric coupling in thin films and that the magnetic structure of YMnO3
can be controlled by substrate selection.",2007-01-16T18:06:16Z
Shot noise in carbon nanotube based Fabry-Perot interferometers,"We report on shot noise measurements in carbon nanotube based Fabry-Perot
electronic interferometers. As a consequence of quantum interferences, the
noise power spectral density oscillates as a function of the voltage applied to
the gate electrode. The quantum shot noise theory accounts for the data
quantitatively. It allows to confirm the existence of two nearly degenerate
orbitals. At resonance, the transmission of the nanotube approaches unity, and
the nanotube becomes noiseless, as observed in quantum point contacts. In this
weak backscattering regime, the dependence of the noise on the backscattering
current is found weaker than expected, pointing either to electron-electron
interactions or to weak decoherence.",2007-03-05T15:12:54Z
Dynamical correlation functions of the XXZ model at finite temperature,"Combining a lattice path integral formulation for thermodynamics with the
solution of the quantum inverse scattering problem for local spin operators, we
derive a multiple integral representation for the time-dependent longitudinal
correlation function of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain at finite temperature
and in an external magnetic field. Our formula reproduces the previous results
in the following three limits: the static, the zero-temperature and the XY
limits.",2007-03-13T02:06:41Z
"Analysis of a SU(4) generalization of Halperin's wave function as an
  approach towards a SU(4) fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene sheets","Inspired by the four-fold spin-valley symmetry of relativistic electrons in
graphene, we investigate a possible SU(4) fractional quantum Hall effect, which
may also arise in bilayer semiconductor quantum Hall systems with small Zeeman
gap. SU(4) generalizations of Halperin's wave functions [Helv. Phys. Acta 56,
75 (1983)], which may break differently the original SU(4) symmetry, are
studied analytically and compared, at nu=2/3, to exact-diagonalization studies.",2007-01-26T16:40:19Z
Error Correction and Digitalization Concepts in Biochemical Computing,"We offer a theoretical design of new systems that show promise for digital
biochemical computing, including realizations of error correction by utilizing

processing using encoded DNA sequences, DNAzyme biocatalyzed reactions and the
use of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles. Digital XOR and NAND logic
gates and copying (fanout) are designed using the same components.",2007-03-13T20:02:57Z
Entropy production and time asymmetry in nonequilibrium fluctuations,"The time-reversal symmetry of nonequilibrium fluctuations is experimentally
investigated in two out-of-equilibrium systems namely, a Brownian particle in a
trap moving at constant speed and an electric circuit with an imposed mean
current. The dynamical randomness of their nonequilibrium fluctuations is
characterized in terms of the standard and time-reversed entropies per unit
time of dynamical systems theory. We present experimental results showing that
their difference equals the thermodynamic entropy production in units of
Boltzmann's constant.",2007-03-27T06:57:12Z
An Upper Bound on the Average Size of Silhouettes,"It is a widely observed phenomenon in computer graphics that the size of the
silhouette of a polyhedron is much smaller than the size of the whole
polyhedron. This paper provides, for the first time, theoretical evidence
supporting this for a large class of objects, namely for polyhedra that
approximate surfaces in some reasonable way; the surfaces may be non-convex and
non-differentiable and they may have boundaries. We prove that such polyhedra
have silhouettes of expected size $O(\sqrt{n})$ where the average is taken over
all points of view and n is the complexity of the polyhedron.",2007-02-14T13:52:35Z
Clausius-Mossotti approximation in the theory of polar materials,"Clausius-Mossotti approximation is extended to describe the measured magnetic
moment of an ellipsoidal sample containing magnetic or nonmagnetic ellipsoidal
inclusions and magnetic or nonmagnetic matrix. The magnetic field in the matrix
and inclusions is calculated. The magnetic energy of a system is calculated
also. The equilibrium shape of a pore in a ferromagnetic sample is
investigated. The phenomenon of cavitation in porous ferromagnetic samples is
described. The model is applied to calculate magnetic properties of granular
superconductors. The effective electric conductivity of a sample of a composite
material, containing an arbitrary number of differently ordered distributions
of ellipsoidal inclusions is calculated. Effective conductivity of a composite
material, consisting of fibers of high conductivity and a matrix of low
conductivity is discussed. Concentrated electric field in the vicinity of the
ends of a conductive nanofiber in a composite material is calculated. The high
quantity of this field is of an extreme importance to provide the proper
functioning of monitors, based on conductive nanofibers in dielectric media.",2007-02-08T20:13:20Z
Properties of Rank Metric Codes,"This paper investigates general properties of codes with the rank metric. We
first investigate asymptotic packing properties of rank metric codes. Then, we
study sphere covering properties of rank metric codes, derive bounds on their
parameters, and investigate their asymptotic covering properties. Finally, we
establish several identities that relate the rank weight distribution of a
linear code to that of its dual code. One of our identities is the counterpart
of the MacWilliams identity for the Hamming metric, and it has a different form
from the identity by Delsarte.",2007-02-13T20:23:38Z
"Domain structure sequence in ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 thin film on
  MgO","The structural evolution of a polydomain ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 film
was studied by temperature dependent X-ray diffraction. Two critical
temperatures were evidenced: T*=740K, corresponding to a change in the domain
structure (a/c/a/c to a1/a2/a1/a2), and Tc_film = 825K where the film undergoes
a ferroelectricparaelectric phase transition. The films remains tetragonal on
the whole range of temperature investigated. The evolutions of the domain
structure and lattice parameters were found to be in very good agreement with
the calculated domain stability map and theoretical temperature-misfit strain
phase diagram respectively.",2007-03-23T13:09:50Z
"Exact analytical calculation for the percolation crossover in
  deterministic partially self-avoiding walks in one-dimensional random media","Consider $N$ points randomly distributed along a line segment of unitary
length. A walker explores this disordered medium moving according to a
partially self-avoiding deterministic walk. The walker, with memory $\mu$,
leaves from the leftmost point and moves, at each discrete time step, to the
nearest point which has not been visited in the preceding $\mu$ steps. Using
open boundary conditions, we have calculated analytically the probability
$P_N(\mu) = (1 - 2^{-\mu})^{N - \mu - 1}$ that all $N$ points are visited, with
$N \gg \mu \gg 1$. This approximated expression for $P_N(\mu)$ is reasonable
even for small $N$ and $\mu$ values, as validated by Monte Carlo simulations.
We show the existence of a critical memory $\mu_1 = \ln N/\ln 2$. For $\mu <
\mu_1 - e/(2\ln2)$, the walker gets trapped in cycles and does not fully
explore the system. For $\mu > \mu_1 + e/(2\ln2)$ the walker explores the whole
system. Since the intermediate region increases as $\ln N$ and its width is
constant, a sharp transition is obtained for one-dimensional large systems.
This means that the walker needs not to have full memory of its trajectory to
explore the whole system. Instead, it suffices to have memory of order
$\log_{2} N$.",2007-02-01T22:24:33Z
"Analytical Solution to Transport in Brownian Ratchets via Gambler's Ruin
  Model","We present an analogy between the classic Gambler's Ruin problem and the
thermally-activated dynamics in periodic Brownian ratchets. By considering each
periodic unit of the ratchet as a site chain, we calculated the transition
probabilities and mean first passage time for transitions between energy minima
of adjacent units. We consider the specific case of Brownian ratchets driven by
Markov dichotomous noise. The explicit solution for the current is derived for
any arbitrary temperature, and is verified numerically by Langevin simulations.
The conditions for vanishing current and current reversal in the ratchet are
obtained and discussed.",2007-01-21T15:27:28Z
Exchange and correlation near the nucleus in density functional theory,"The near nucleus behavior of the exchange-correlation potential $v_{xc}({\bf
r})$ in Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham density functional theory is investigated. It is
shown that near the nucleus the linear term of $O(r)$ of the spherically
averaged exchange-correlation potential ${\bar v}_{xc}(r)$ is nonzero, and that
it arises purely from the difference between the kinetic energy density at the
nucleus of the interacting system and the noninteracting Kohn-Sham system. An
analytical expression for the linear term is derived. Similar results for the
exchange $v_{x}({\bf r})$ and correlation $v_{c}({\bf r})$ potentials are also
obtained separately. It is further pointed out that the linear term in
$v_{xc}({\bf r})$ arising mainly from $v_{c}({\bf r})$ is rather small, and
$v_{xc}({\bf r})$ therefore has a nearly quadratic structure near the nucleus.
Implications of the results for the construction of the Kohn-Sham system are
discussed with examples.",2007-02-14T10:28:05Z
"Percolation model for the superconductor-insulator transition in
  granular films","We study the temperature dependence of the superconductor-insulator
transition in granular superconductors. Empirically, these systems are
characterized by very broad resistance tails, which depend exponentially on the
temperature, and the normal state resistance. We model these systems by a
two-dimensional random resistor percolation networks in which the resistance
between two grains is governed either by Josephson junction coupling or by
quasi particle tunneling. Our numerical simulations as well as an effective
medium evaluation explain the experimental results over a wide range of
temperatures and resistances. Using effective medium approximation we find an
analytical expression for the effective resistance of the system and the value
of the critical resistance separating conducting from insulating branches.",2007-01-14T09:34:00Z
"Phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations with
  planewaves and pseudopotentials--applications to atoms and molecules","The phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AF QMC) method [S. Zhang
and H. Krakauer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 136401 (2003)] is used to carry out a
systematic study of the dissociation and ionization energies of second-row
group 3A-7A atoms and dimers, Al, Si, P, S, Cl. In addition, the P_2 dimer is
compared to the third-row As_2 dimer, which is also triply-bonded. This method
projects the many-body ground state by means of importance-sampled random walks
in the space of Slater determinants. The Monte Carlo phase problem, due to the
electron-electron Coulomb interaction, is controlled via the phaseless
approximation, with a trial wave function |Psi_T>. As in previous calculations,
a mean-field single Slater determinant is used as |Psi_T>. The method is
formulated in the Hilbert space defined by any chosen one-particle basis. The
present calculations use a planewave basis under periodic boundary conditions
with norm-conserving pseudopotentials. Computational details of the planewave
AF QMC method are presented. The isolated systems chosen here allow a
systematic study of the various algorithmic issues. We show the accuracy of the
planewave method and discuss its convergence with respect to parameters such as
the supercell size and planewave cutoff. The use of standard norm-conserving
pseudopotentials in the many-body AF QMC framework is examined.",2007-02-05T17:31:44Z
Interacting spinor and scalar fields in Bianchi cosmology,"A self-consistent system of interacting spinor and scalar fields is
considered within the scope of Bianchi type VI cosmological model filled with a
perfect fluid. The contribution of the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$-term)
is taken into account as well. Exact self-consistent solutions to the field
equations are obtained for a special choice of spatial inhomogeneity and the
interaction terms of the spinor and scalar fields. It has been found that some
special choice of metric functions can give rise to a singularity-free
solutions independent of the value and sign of the $\Lambda$ term. It is also
shown that the introduction of a positive $\Lambda$, the most widespread kind
of dark energy, leads to the rapid growth of the universe, while the negative
one, corresponding to an additional gravitational energy gives rise to an
oscillatory or non-periodic mode of expansion. The role of the spatial
inhomogeneity in the evolution of the universe is clarified within the scope of
the considered models.",2007-01-10T11:56:30Z
"Warped product spaces and geodesic motion in the neighbourhood of
  hypersurfaces","We study the classical geodesic motions of nonzero rest mass test particles
and photons in five-dimensional warped product spaces. We show that it is
possible to obtain a general picture of these motions, using the natural
decoupling that occurs in such spaces between the motions in the fifth
dimension and the motion in the hypersurfaces. This splitting allows the use of
phase space analysis in order to investigate the possible confinement of
particles and photons to hypersurfaces in five-dimensional warped product
spaces. Using such analysis, we find a novel form of quasi-confinement which is
oscillatory and neutrally stable. We also find that this class of warped
product spaces locally satisfy the Z2 symmetry by default. The importance of
such a confinement is that it is purely due to the classical gravitational
effects, without requiring the presence of brane-type confinement mechanisms.",2007-02-10T14:38:36Z
Self-Consistent Field study of Polyelectrolyte Brushes,"We formulate a self-consistent field theory for polyelectrolyte brushes in
the presence of counterions. We numerically solve the self-consistent field
equations and study the monomer density profile, the distribution of
counterions, and the total charge distribution. We study the scaling relations
for the brush height and compare them to the prediction of other theories. We
find a weak dependence of the brush height on the grafting density.We fit the
counterion distribution outside the brush by the Gouy-Chapman solution for a
virtual charged wall. We calculate the amount of counterions outside the brush
and find that it saturates as the charge of the polyelectrolytes increases.",2007-03-12T05:58:15Z
Effect of interaction shape on the condensed DNA toroid,"We investigate how different microscopic interactions between semiflexible
chain segments can qualitatively alter the physical properties of the condensed
toroid. We propose a general form of the Hamiltonian of the toroid and discuss
its analytic properties. For different interactions, the theory predicts
different scaling behaviours of the mean toroidal and cross sectional radii,
$r_c$ and $r_{cross}$, as functions of the contour length L: $(r_c, r_{cross})
\sim L^{\nu(N_c)}$ with $\nu=(1/5, 2/5)$ for the van der Waals type,
$\nu=(-1/3, 2/3)$ for the Coulomb type, $\nu=(-1, 1)$ for the delta function
type attractions in the asymptotic limit. For the toroids with finite winding
number $N_c=100 \sim 400$, we find $\nu \simeq 0$ for the Yukawa interaction
with screening parameter $\kappa=0.5 \sim 1.0$, and $\nu=0.1 \sim 0.13$ for the
van der Waals type interactions. These findings could provide possible
explanation for the experimentally well known observation $\nu \simeq 0$ of the
condensed DNA toroids. Conformational transitions are also discussed.",2007-01-30T09:04:48Z
Precise asymptotics for a variable-range hopping model,"For a system of localised electron states the DC conductivity vanishes at
zero temperature, but localised electrons can conduct at finite temperature.
Mott gave a theory for the low-temperature conductivity in terms of a

asymptotic results for a modified variable-range hopping model proposed by S.

"On the Possibility of Using Semiconductor Nanocolumns for the
  Realization of Quantum Bits","We propose the use of quantum dots formed in a semiconductor nanocolumn for
the realization of charge or spin based quantum bits. The radial carrier
confinement is achieved by employing conformal overgrowth, while multiple
segmented gates are used to control the quantum dot properties. Different
concepts for read-out and control are discussed. Furthermore, we assess which
combinations of core nanowires and shell materials are feasible.",2007-03-20T16:00:47Z
Theoretical phase diagram of ultrathin films of incipient ferroelectrics,"We have used a first-principles-based scheme to compute the
temperature-versus-misfit strain ``Pertsev'' phase diagram of ultrathin films
of {\sl incipient} ferroelectric KTaO$_3$. Our results suggest that, at
variance with the bulk material, KTaO$_3$ ultrathin films cannot be described
as quantum paraelectrics. Rather, the behavior of the films is largely
determined by surface/interface effects that favor ferroelectricity and the
imperfect screening of the depolarizing fields. This leads to Pertsev phase
diagrams that are qualitatively similar to those of {\sl normal} ferroelectrics
such as BaTiO$_3$.",2007-02-12T18:32:44Z
"Drude Weight of the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model -- Reexamination of
  Finite-Size Effect in Exact Diagonalization Study --","The Drude weight of the Hubbard model on the two-dimensional square lattice
is studied by the exact diagonalizations applied to clusters up to 20 sites. We
carefully examine finite-size effects by consideration of the appropriate
shapes of clusters and the appropriate boundary condition beyond the imitation
of employing only the simple periodic boundary condition. We successfully
capture the behavior of the Drude weight that is proportional to the squared
hole doping concentration. Our present result gives a consistent understanding
of the transition between the Mott insulator and doped metals. We also find, in
the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity, that the mid-gap
incoherent part emerges more quickly than the coherent part and rather
insensitive to the doping concentration in accordance with the scaling of the
Drude weight.",2007-01-30T06:29:01Z
"Nonlinear excitation of second sound in quantum solutions He3-He4 due to
  light wave absorption","Nonlinear excitation of second sound in superfluid solutions He3-He4 by light
waves due to their absorption is discussed. Nonlinear wave equations that model
the interaction of second-sound waves with light waves are derived, the
expression for the nonlinear interaction length is obtained and an
order-of-magnitude numerical estimate of the distance at which a second-sound
wave could be amplified from a fluctuation level up to observable values is
performed.",2007-03-05T18:45:54Z
"Giant Vortices Below the Surface of NbSe$_2$ Detected Using Low Energy
  $β$-NMR","A low energy radioactive beam of polarized $^8$Li has been used to observe
the vortex lattice near the surface of superconducting NbSe$_2$. The
inhomogeneous magnetic field distribution associated with the vortex lattice
was measured using depth-resolved $\beta$-detected NMR. Below $T_c$ one
observes the characteristic lineshape for a triangular vortex lattice which
depends on the magnetic penetration depth and vortex core radius. The size of
the vortex core varies strongly with magnetic field. In particular in a low
field of 10.8 mT the core radius is much larger than the coherence length. The
possible origin of these giant vortices is discussed.",2007-03-07T09:17:18Z
Thomas-Fermi Screening in Graphene,"The in-plane static screening of the field originated by a charge placed in a
graphene sheet is investigated. A self-consistent field equation in the real
space domain is obtained by using a suitable Thomas-Fermi procedure. Exact and
approximated (for qualitative considerations) solutions are presented. In the
case of a charged sheet, the screened potential presents a tail dependent on
the free carrier density whose importance is connected with the local features
of the impurity system. Early conclusions about Thomas-Fermi screening in
graphene are revised.",2007-01-05T13:56:57Z
"Spectral properties of a Rydberg atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein
  condensate","The electronic spectrum of a Rydberg atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein
condensate is investigated. The Heisenberg equations of motions for the
condensate and the Rydberg atom are derived. Neglecting the backaction of the
Rydberg atom onto the condensate decouples the equations describing the
condensate and Rydberg atom. In this case the spectral structure of the Rydberg
atom is completely determined by an effective potential which depends on the
density distribution of the condensate. We study the spectral properties for
the situation of an isotropic harmonic and anharmonic as well as axially
symmetric confinement. In the latter case an intriguing analogy with Rydberg
atoms in magnetic fields is encountered.",2007-03-16T16:33:19Z
"Effective non-additive pair potential for lock-and-key interacting
  particles: the role of the limited valence","Theoretical studies of self-assembly processes and condensed phases in
colloidal systems are often based on effective inter-particle potentials. Here
we show that developing an effective potential for particles interacting with a
limited number of ``lock-and-key'' selective bonds (due to the specificity of
bio-molecular interactions) requires -- beside the non-sphericity of the
potential -- a (many body) constraint that prevent multiple bonding on the same
site. We show the importance of retaining both valence and bond-selectivity by
developing, as a case study, a simple effective potential describing the
interaction between colloidal particles coated by four single-strand DNA
chains.",2007-03-14T19:54:20Z
Nematic Order by Disorder in Spin-2 BECs,"The effect of quantum and thermal fluctuations on the phase diagram of spin-2
BECs is examined. They are found to play an important role in the nematic part
of the phase diagram, where a mean-field treatment of two-body interactions is
unable to lift the accidental degeneracy between nematic states. Quantum and
thermal fluctuations resolve this degeneracy, selecting the uniaxial nematic
state, for scattering lengths $a_4>a_2$, and the square biaxial nematic state
for $a_4<a_2$. Paradoxically, the fluctuation induced order is stronger at
higher temperatures, for a range of temperatures below $T_c$. For the
experimentally relevant cases of spin-2 $^{87}$Rb and $^{23}$Na, we argue that
such fluctuations could successfully compete against other effects like the
quadratic Zeeman field, and stabilize the uniaxial phase for experimentally
realistic conditions. A continuous transition of the Ising type from uniaxial
to square biaxial order is predicted on raising the magnetic field. These
systems present a promising experimental opportunity to realize the `order by
disorder' phenomenon.",2007-02-05T19:32:51Z
"Compressible Turbulence in Galaxy Clusters: Physics and Stochastic
  Particle Re-acceleration","We attempt to explain the non-thermal emission arising from galaxy clusters
as a result of the re-acceleration of electrons by compressible turbulence
induced by cluster mergers. In our model intracluster medium (ICM) is
represented by a high beta plasma in which turbulent motions are driven at
large scales. The corresponding injection velocities are higher than the Alfven
velocity. As a result, the turbulence is approximately isotropic up to the
scale at which the turbulent velocity gets comparable with the Alfven velocity.
Under the hypothesis that turbulence in the ICM is highly super- Alfvenic the
magnetic field is passively advected and the field lines are bended on scales
smaller than that of the classical, unmagnetized, ion-ion mean free path. This
affects ion diffusion and the strength of the effective viscosity. Under these
conditions the bulk of turbulence in hot (5-10 keV temperature) galaxy clusters
is likely to be dissipated at collisionless scales via resonant coupling with
thermal and fast particles. We use collisionless physics to derive the
amplitude of the different components of the energy of the compressible modes,
and review and extend the treatment of plasma damping in the ICM. We calculate
the acceleration of both protons and electrons taking into account both TTD
acceleration and non-resonant acceleration by large scale compressions. We find
that relativistic electrons can be re-accelerated in the ICM up to energies of
several GeV provided that the rms velocity of the compressible turbulent-eddies
is (V_L/c_s)^2~0.15-0.3. We find that under typical conditions ~ 2-5 % of the
energy flux of the cascading of compressible motions injected at large scales
goes into the acceleration of fast particles and that this may explain the
observed non-thermal emission from merging galaxy clusters.",2007-03-22T18:35:45Z
Nanoscale data storage,"The object of this article is to review the development of ultrahigh-density,
nanoscale data storage, i.e., nanostorage. As a fundamentally new type of
storage system, the recording mechanisms of nanostorage may be completely
different to those of the traditional devices. Currently, two types of
molecules are being studied for potential application in nanostorage. One is
molecular electronic elements including molecular wires, rectifiers, switches,
and transistors. The other approach employs nanostructured materials such as
nanotubes, nanowires, and nanoparticles. The challenges for nanostorage are not
only the materials, ultrahigh data-densities, fabrication-costs, device
operating temperatures and large-scale integration, but also the development of
the physical principles and models. There are already some breakthroughs
obtained, but it is still unclear what kind of nanostorage systems can
ultimately replace the current silicon based transistors. A promising candidate
may be a molecular-nanostructure hybrid device with sub-5 nm dimensions.",2007-01-29T06:59:30Z
Molecular Doping of Graphene,"Graphene, a one-atom thick zero gap semiconductor [1, 2], has been attracting
an increasing interest due to its remarkable physical properties ranging from
an electron spectrum resembling relativistic dynamics [3-12] to ballistic
transport under ambient conditions [1-4]. The latter makes graphene a promising
material for future electronics and the recently demonstrated possibility of
chemical doping without significant change in mobility has improved graphene's
prospects further [13]. However, to find optimal dopants and, more generally,
to progress towards graphene-based electronics requires understanding the
physical mechanism behind the chemical doping, which has been lacking so far.
Here, we present the first joint experimental and theoretical investigation of
adsorbates on graphene. We elucidate a general relation between the doping
strength and whether or not adsorbates have a magnetic moment: The paramagnetic
single NO2 molecule is found to be a strong acceptor, whereas its diamagnetic
dimer N2O4 causes only weak doping. This effect is related to the peculiar
density of states of graphene, which provides an ideal situation for model
studies of doping effects in semiconductors. Furthermore, we explain recent
results on its ""chemical sensor"" properties, in particular, the possibility to
detect a single NO2 molecule [13].",2007-03-15T04:27:47Z
Constructing Optimal Highways,"For two points $p$ and $q$ in the plane, a straight line $h$, called a
highway, and a real $v>1$, we define the \emph{travel time} (also known as the
\emph{city distance}) from $p$ and $q$ to be the time needed to traverse a
quickest path from $p$ to $q$, where the distance is measured with speed $v$ on
$h$ and with speed 1 in the underlying metric elsewhere.
  Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in the plane and a highway speed $v$, we
consider the problem of finding a \emph{highway} that minimizes the maximum
travel time over all pairs of points in $S$. If the orientation of the highway
is fixed, the optimal highway can be computed in linear time, both for the
$L_1$- and the Euclidean metric as the underlying metric. If arbitrary
orientations are allowed, then the optimal highway can be computed in $O(n^{2}
\log n)$ time. We also consider the problem of computing an optimal pair of
highways, one being horizontal, one vertical.",2007-03-08T17:22:21Z
Strongly Correlated States of Ultracold Rotating Dipolar Fermi Gases,"We study strongly correlated ground and excited states of rotating quasi-2D
Fermi gases constituted of a small number of dipole-dipole interacting
particles with dipole moments polarized perpendicular to the plane of motion.
As the number of atoms grows, the system enters {\it an intermediate regime},
where ground states are subject to a competition between distinct bulk-edge
configurations. This effect obscures their description in terms of composite
fermions and leads to the appearance of novel composite fermion quasi-hole
states. In the presence of dipolar interactions, the principal Laughlin state
at filling $\nu=1/3$ exhibits a substantial energy gap for neutral (total
angular momentum conserving) excitations, and is well-described as an
incompressible Fermi liquid. Instead, at lower fillings, the ground state
structure favors crystalline order.",2007-02-10T21:14:25Z
"Analytic theory of pair distribution functions in symmetric
  electron-electron and electron-hole bilayers","We present a self-consistent analytic theory of the intra-layer and
inter-layer pair correlation functions in electron-electron and electron-hole
fluid bilayer systems. Our approach involves the solution of a zero-energy
scattering Schroedinger equation with an effective potential which includes a
Bose-like term from Jastrow-Feenberg correlations and a Fermi term from kinetic
energy and exchange, tailored to yield the Hartree-Fock limit at high carrier
density. The theory is also shown to satisfy the plasmon sum rule and the
charge neutrality condition. We obtain good agreement with the available
Quantum Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) data in symmetric bilayers over a wide
range of carrier density and layer spacing, and stress the role of three-body
correlation terms in yielding fully quantitative agreement at strong coupling.
Signals of impending transitions to density-modulated states at strong coupling
and low layer spacing appear in the calculated pair correlations through
inter-layer in-phase oscillations for electron-hole bilayers and out-of-phase
oscillations for electron-electron bilayers, in agreement with the DMC
findings.",2007-02-14T10:51:24Z

ellipsometry, and VUV reflectance for energies between 0 and 24 eV. A stablized
Kramers-Kronig transformation yields the optical conductivity and reveals
changes in the optical spectral weight up to 24 eV at the metal to insulator

within $\rm 0.3 %$. The redistribution of spectral weight between low and high

Mg and Fe as functions of the galaxy velocity dispersion, sigma. Our results
are compatible with a scenario in which the stellar populations of massive
elliptical galaxies, independently of their environment and mass, had formation
timescales shorter than ~1 Gyr. This result implies that massive elliptical
galaxies have evolved passively since, at least, as long ago as z~2. For a
given galaxy mass the duration of star formation is shorter in those galaxies
belonging to more dense environments. Finally, we show that the abundance
ratios [CN/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] are the key ""chemical clocks"" to infer the star
formation history timescales in ellipticals. In particular, [Mg/Fe] provides an
upper limit for those formation timescales, while [CN/Fe] apperars to be the
most suitable parameter to resolve them in elliptical galaxies with sigma<300
km/s.",2007-03-08T18:51:58Z
Exact Markovian kinetic equation for a quantum Brownian oscillator,"We derive an exact Markovian kinetic equation for an oscillator linearly
coupled to a heat bath, describing quantum Brownian motion. Our work is based
on the subdynamics formulation developed by Prigogine and collaborators. The
space of distribution functions is decomposed into independent subspaces that
remain invariant under Liouville dynamics. For integrable systems in
Poincar\'e's sense the invariant subspaces follow the dynamics of uncoupled,
renormalized particles. In contrast for non-integrable systems, the invariant
subspaces follow a dynamics with broken-time symmetry, involving generalized
functions. This result indicates that irreversibility and stochasticity are
exact properties of dynamics in generalized function spaces. We comment on the
relation between our Markovian kinetic equation and the Hu-Paz-Zhang equation.",2007-02-22T06:01:35Z
"Signatures of Discontinuity in the Exchange-Correlation Energy
  Functional Derived from the Subband Electronic Structure of Semiconductor
  Quantum Wells","The discontinuous character of the exact exchange-correlation $(xc)$ energy
functional of Density Functional Theory is shown to arise naturally in the
subband spectra of semiconductor quantum wells. Using an \emph{ab-initio} $xc$
functional, including exchange exactly and correlation in an exact partial way,
a discontinuity appears in the $xc$ potential, each time a subband becomes
slightly occupied. Exchange and correlation give opposite contributions to the
discontinuity, with correlation overcoming exchange. The jump in the
intersubband energy is in excellent agreement with experimental data.",2007-02-07T19:49:29Z
"Node-like excitations in superconducting PbMo6S8 probed by scanning
  tunneling spectroscopy","We present the first scanning tunneling spectroscopy study on the Chevrel
phase PbMo6S8, an extreme type II superconductor with a coherence length only
slightly larger than in high-Tc cuprates. Tunneling spectra measured on
atomically flat terraces are spatially homogeneous and show well-defined
coherence peaks. The low-energy spectral weight, the zero bias conductance and
the temperature dependence of the gap are incompatible with a conventional
isotropic s-wave interpretation, revealing the presence of low-energy
excitations in the superconducting state. We show that our data are consistent
with the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap.",2007-02-12T14:59:45Z
Path Loss Models Based on Stochastic Rays,"In this paper, two-dimensional percolation lattices are applied to describe
wireless propagation environment, and stochastic rays are employed to model the
trajectories of radio waves. We first derive the probability that a stochastic
ray undergoes certain number of collisions at a specific spatial location.
Three classes of stochastic rays with different constraint conditions are
considered: stochastic rays of random walks, and generic stochastic rays with
two different anomalous levels. Subsequently, we obtain the closed-form
formulation of mean received power of radio waves under non line-of-sight
conditions for each class of stochastic ray. Specifically, the determination of
model parameters and the effects of lattice structures on the path loss are
investigated. The theoretical results are validated by comparison with
experimental data.",2007-03-10T02:26:08Z
"Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Ga Penetration along Grain Boundaries
  in Al: a Dislocation Climb Mechanism","Many systems where a liquid metal is in contact with a polycrystalline solid
exhibit deep liquid grooves where the grain boundary meets the solid-liquid
interface. For example, liquid Ga quickly penetrates deep into grain boundaries
in Al, leading to intergranular fracture under very small stresses. We report
on a series of molecular dynamics simulations of liquid Ga in contact with an
Al bicrystal. We identify the mechanism for liquid metal embrittlement, develop
a new model for it, and show that is in excellent agreement with both
simulation and experimental data.",2007-02-16T07:46:31Z
"Quantum interference in the classically forbidden region: a parametric
  oscillator","We study tunneling between period two states of a parametrically modulated
oscillator. The tunneling matrix element is shown to oscillate with the varying
frequency of the modulating field. The effect is due to spatial oscillations of
the wave function and the related interference in the classically forbidden
region. The oscillations emerge already in the ground state of the oscillator
Hamiltonian in the rotating frame, which is quartic in the momentum.",2007-03-18T19:14:46Z
"A polynomial time algorithm to approximate the mixed volume within a
  simply exponential factor","Let ${\bf K} = (K_1, ..., K_n)$ be an $n$-tuple of convex compact subsets in
the Euclidean space $\R^n$, and let $V(\cdot)$ be the Euclidean volume in
$\R^n$. The Minkowski polynomial $V_{{\bf K}}$ is defined as $V_{{\bf
K}}(\lambda_1, ... ,\lambda_n) = V(\lambda_1 K_1 +, ..., + \lambda_n K_n)$ and
the mixed volume $V(K_1, ..., K_n)$ as $$ V(K_1, ..., K_n) =
\frac{\partial^n}{\partial \lambda_1...\partial \lambda_n} V_{{\bf
K}}(\lambda_1 K_1 +, ..., + \lambda_n K_n). $$ Our main result is a poly-time
algorithm which approximates $V(K_1, ..., K_n)$ with multiplicative error $e^n$
and with better rates if the affine dimensions of most of the sets $K_i$ are
small. Our approach is based on a particular approximation of $\log(V(K_1, ...,
K_n))$ by a solution of some convex minimization problem. We prove the mixed
volume analogues of the Van der Waerden and Schrijver-Valiant conjectures on
the permanent. These results, interesting on their own, allow us to justify the
abovementioned approximation by a convex minimization, which is solved using
the ellipsoid method and a randomized poly-time time algorithm for the
approximation of the volume of a convex set.",2007-02-02T01:09:36Z
Coefficient of restitution for viscoelastic disks,"The dissipative collision of two identical viscoelastic disks is studied. By
using a known law for the elastic part of the interaction force and the
viscoelastic damping model an analytical solution for the coefficient of
restitution shall be given. The coefficient of restitution depends
significantly on the impact velocity. It approaches one for small velocities
and decreases for increasing velocities.",2007-01-08T11:22:37Z
Non-monotonic Relaxation in Systems with Reentrant Type Interaction,"Recently, interesting non-monotonic time evolution has been pointed out in
the experiments by J\""onsson, {\it et al.} and Jonsson {\it et.al.} and also in
the numerical simulation by Takayama and Hukushima where the magnetic
susceptibility does not monotonically relax to the equilibrium value, but moves
to the opposite side. We study mechanism of this puzzling non-monotonic
dynamical property in a frustrated Ising model in which the equilibrium
correlation exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence (reentrant type). We
study the time evolution of spin correlation function after sudden change of
temperature. There, we find that the value of the correlation function shows
non-monotonic relaxation, and analyze mechanisms of the non-monotonicity. We
also point out that competition between different configurations widely causes
non-monotonic relaxation.",2007-02-15T11:58:20Z
On the stress and torque tensors in fluid membranes,"We derive the membrane elastic stress and torque tensors using the standard
Helfrich model and a direct variational method in which the edges of a membrane
are infinitesimally translated and rotated. We give simple expressions of the
stress and torque tensors both in the local tangent frame and in projection
onto a fixed frame. We recover and extend the results of Capovilla and Guven
[J. Phys. A, 2002, \textbf{35}, 6233], which were obtained using covariant
geometry and Noether's theorem: we show that the Gaussian rigidity contributes
to the torque tensor and we include the effect of a surface potential in the
stress tensor. Many interesting situations may be investigated directly using
force and torque balances instead of full energy minimization. As examples, we
consider the force exerted at the end of a membrane tubule, membrane adhesion
and domain contact conditions.",2007-02-12T16:29:06Z
"The observed ionization rate of the intergalactic medium and the
  ionizing emissivity at z >5: Evidence for a photon starved and extended epoch
  of reionization","We use a large set of hydrodynamical simulations, combined with measurements
of the Lyman alpha opacity of the IGM taken from the literature, to obtain
robust estimates for the photoionization rate per hydrogen atom at z=5 and 6.
We find the photoionization rate drops by a factor of two and four,
respectively, compared to our recent measurements at z = 2 - 4. The number of
ionizing photons emitted by known sources at z=5 and 6, based on an
extrapolation of source numbers below the detection limit and standard
assumptions for the relationship between the ionizing emissivity and observed
luminosity density at 1500 Angstroms, are in reasonable agreement with the
photoionization rates inferred from the Lyman alpha forest if the escape
fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies is large (>= 20 per cent). Claims to
the contrary may be attributed to the adoption of an unduly high value for the
clumping factor of ionized hydrogen. Using physically motivated assumptions for
the mean free path of ionizing photons our measurements of the photoionization
rate can be turned into an estimate of the ionizing emissivity. In comoving
units the inferred ionizing emissivity is nearly constant over the redshift
range 2-6 and corresponds to 1.5-3 photons emitted per hydrogen atom over a
time interval corresponding to the age of the Universe at z=6. This strongly
suggests that the epoch of reionization was photon-starved and extended.

"A comparison of methods for gravitational wave burst searches from LIGO
  and Virgo","The search procedure for burst gravitational waves has been studied using 24
hours of simulated data in a network of three interferometers (Hanford 4-km,
Livingston 4-km and Virgo 3-km are the example interferometers). Several
methods to detect burst events developed in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration
(LSC) and Virgo collaboration have been studied and compared. We have performed
coincidence analysis of the triggers obtained in the different interferometers
with and without simulated signals added to the data. The benefits of having
multiple interferometers of similar sensitivity are demonstrated by comparing
the detection performance of the joint coincidence analysis with LSC and Virgo
only burst searches. Adding Virgo to the LIGO detector network can increase by
50% the detection efficiency for this search. Another advantage of a joint
LIGO-Virgo network is the ability to reconstruct the source sky position. The
reconstruction accuracy depends on the timing measurement accuracy of the
events in each interferometer, and is displayed in this paper with a fixed
source position example.",2007-01-03T16:35:38Z
"Z2 topological term, the global anomaly, and the two-dimensional
  symplectic symmetry class of Anderson localization","We discuss, for a two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian with random scalar
potential, the presence of a $Z_2$ topological term in the non-linear sigma
model encoding the physics of Anderson localization in the symplectic symmetry
class. The $Z_2$ topological term realizes the sign of the Pfaffian of a family
of Dirac operators. We compute the corresponding global anomaly, i.e., the
change in the sign of the Pfaffian by studying a spectral flow numerically.
This $Z_2$ topological effect can be relevant to graphene when the impurity
potential is long-ranged and, also, to the two-dimensional boundaries of a
three-dimensional lattice model of $Z_2$ topological insulators in the
symplectic symmetry class.",2007-02-22T17:39:45Z
The Phase Diagram of 1-in-3 Satisfiability Problem,"We study the typical case properties of the 1-in-3 satisfiability problem,
the boolean satisfaction problem where a clause is satisfied by exactly one
literal, in an enlarged random ensemble parametrized by average connectivity
and probability of negation of a variable in a clause. Random 1-in-3
Satisfiability and Exact 3-Cover are special cases of this ensemble. We
interpolate between these cases from a region where satisfiability can be
typically decided for all connectivities in polynomial time to a region where
deciding satisfiability is hard, in some interval of connectivities. We derive
several rigorous results in the first region, and develop the
one-step--replica-symmetry-breaking cavity analysis in the second one. We
discuss the prediction for the transition between the almost surely satisfiable
and the almost surely unsatisfiable phase, and other structural properties of
the phase diagram, in light of cavity method results.",2007-02-26T17:29:57Z
"The Chamomile Scheme: An Optimized Algorithm for N-body simulations on
  Programmable Graphics Processing Units","We present an algorithm named ""Chamomile Scheme"". The scheme is fully
optimized for calculating gravitational interactions on the latest programmable
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), NVIDIA GeForce8800GTX, which has (a) small but
fast shared memories (16 K Bytes * 16) with no broadcasting mechanism and (b)
floating point arithmetic hardware of 500 Gflop/s but only for single
precision. Based on this scheme, we have developed a library for gravitational
N-body simulations, ""CUNBODY-1"", whose measured performance reaches to 173
Gflop/s for 2048 particles and 256 Gflop/s for 131072 particles.",2007-03-06T01:17:28Z
The Distance to the Isolated Neutron Star RX J0720.4-3125,"We have used a set of dedicated astrometric data from the Hubble Space
Telescope to measure the parallax and proper motion of the nearby neutron star
RX J0720.4-3125. At each of eight epochs over two years, we used the High
Resolution Camera of the Advanced Camera for Surveys to measure the position of
the B=26.6 target to a precision of ~2 mas (~0.07 pix) relative to 22 other
stars. From these data we measure a parallax of pi=2.8+/-0.9 mas (for a
distance of 360+170-90 pc) and a proper motion of mu=107.8+/-1.2 mas/yr.
Exhaustive testing of every stage of our analysis suggests that it is robust,
with a maximum systematic uncertainty on the parallax of 0.4 mas. The distance
is compatible with earlier estimates made from scaling the optical emission of
RX J0720.4-3125 relative to the even closer neutron star RX J1856.5-3754. The
distance and proper motion imply a transverse velocity of 180+90-40 km/s,
comparable to velocities observed for radio pulsars. The speed and direction
suggest an origin for RX J0720.4-3125 in the Trumpler 10 OB association ~0.7
Myr ago, with a possible range of 0.5-1.0 Myr given by the uncertainty in the
distance.",2007-03-13T22:02:33Z
Acoustic attenuation in glasses and its relation with the boson peak,"A theory for the vibrational dynamics in disordered solids [W. Schirmacher,
Europhys. Lett. {\bf 73}, 892 (2006)], based on the random spatial variation of
the shear modulus, has been applied to determine the wavevector ($k$)
dependence of the Brillouin peak position ($\Omega_k)$ and width ($\Gamma_k$),
as well as the density of vibrational states ($g(\omega)$), in disordered
systems. As a result, we give a firm theoretical ground to the ubiquitous $k^2$
dependence of $\Gamma_k$ observed in glasses. Moreover, we derive a
quantitative relation between the excess of the density of states (the boson
peak) and $\Gamma_k$, two quantities that were not considered related before.
The successful comparison of this relation with the outcome of experiments and
numerical simulations gives further support to the theory.",2007-01-05T16:14:57Z
"The Galaxy Luminosity Function at z~1 in the HUDF: Probing the Dwarf
  Population","We present a catalog of spectro-photometric redshifts for 1308 galaxies from
the GRism ACS Program for Extragalactic Science (GRAPES) observations with the
Hubble Space Telescope. These low-resolution spectra between 6000 A and 9500 A
are supplemented with U, J, H, and Ks from various facilities, resulting in
redshifts computed with ~40 spectral bins per galaxy. For 81 galaxies between
0.5<z<1.5 with spectroscopic redshifts, the standard deviation in the
fractional error in (1+z) is 0.046. With this catalog, we compute the B-band
luminosity function in this redshift range from 72 galaxies. Owing to the depth
of the GRAPES survey, we are able to accurately constrain the faint-end slope
by going to M_B~-18 mag at 0.8<z<1.2, nearly two magnitudes fainter than
previous studies. The faint-end slope is alpha=-1.32+-0.07. When compared to
numerous published values at various redshifts, we find strong evidence for a
steepening of the faint-end slope with redshift which is expected in the
hierarchical formation scenario of galaxies.",2007-03-28T22:17:54Z
"Two-dimensional spin-filtered chiral network model for the Z_2 quantum
  spin-Hall effect","The effects of static disorder on the Z_2 quantum spin-Hall effect for
non-interacting electrons propagating in two-dimensional space is studied
numerically. A two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric network model is
constructed to account for the effects of static disorder on the propagation of
non-interacting electrons subjected to spin-orbit couplings. This network model
is different from past network models belonging to the symplectic symmetry
class in that the propagating modes along the links of the network can be
arranged into an odd number of Kramers doublet. It is found that (1) a
two-dimensional metallic phase of finite extent is embedded in a Z_2 insulating
phase in parameter space and (2) the quantum phase transitions between the
metallic and Z_2 insulating phases belong to the conventional symplectic
universality class in two space dimensions.",2007-02-08T10:31:12Z
"Effect of electron and hole doping on the structure of C, Si, and S
  nanowires","We use ab initio density functional calculations to study the effect of
electron and hole doping on the equilibrium geometry and electronic structure
of C, Si, and S monatomic wires. Independent of doping, all these nanowires are
found to be metallic. In absence of doping, C wires are straight, whereas Si
and S wires display a zigzag structure. Besides two preferred bond angles of 60
deg and 120 deg in Si wires, we find an additional metastable bond angle of 90
deg in S wires. The equilibrium geometry and electronic structure of these
nanowires is shown to change drastically upon electron and hole doping.",2007-03-02T16:41:04Z
Velocity dependence of friction and Kramers relaxation rates,"We study the influence of the velocity dependence of friction on the escape
of a Brownian particle from the deep potential well ($E_{b} \gg k_{B}T$,
$E_{b}$ is the barrier height, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the
bath temperature). The bath-induced relaxation is treated within the Rayleigh
model (a heavy particle of mass $M$ in the bath of light particles of mass
$m\ll M$) up to the terms of the order of $O(\lambda^{4})$,
$\lambda^{2}=m/M\ll1$. The term $\sim 1$ is equivalent to the Fokker-Planck
dissipative operator, and the term $\sim \lambda^{2}$ is responsible for the
velocity dependence of friction. As expected, the correction to the Kramers
escape rate in the overdamped limit is proportional to $\lambda^{2}$ and is
small. The corresponding correction in the underdamped limit is proportional to
$\lambda^{2}E_{b}/(k_{B}T)$ and is not necessarily small. We thus suggest that
the effects due to the velocity-dependent friction may be of considerable
importance in determining the rate of escape of an under- and moderately damped
Brownian particle from a deep potential well, while they are of minor
importance for an overdamped particle.",2007-03-12T20:21:15Z
"Angle-dependent magnetoresistance oscillations due to magnetic breakdown
  orbits","We present experimental evidence for a hitherto unconfirmed type of
angle-dependent magnetoresistance oscillation caused by magnetic breakdown. The
effect was observed in the organic superconductor
kappa-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu(NCS)$_2$ using hydrostatic pressures of up to 9.8 kbar
and magnetic fields of up to 33 T. In addition, we show that similar
oscillations are revealed in ambient pressure measurements, provided that the
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are suppressed either by elevated temperatures
or filtering of the data. These results provide a compelling validation of
Pippard's semiclassical picture of magnetic breakdown.",2007-02-24T12:28:48Z
"Ultra long range plasmonic waveguides using quasi two dimensional
  metallic layers","We calculate the bound plasmonic modes of a quantum metamaterial slab,
comprised of multiple quasi two dimensional electron gas (Q2DEG) layers, whose
thickness is much smaller than the optical wavelength. For the first order
transverse magnetic (TM) optical and the surface plasmonic modes we find
propagation constants which are independent of both the electron density and of
the scattering rates in the Q2DEGs. This leads to extremely long propagation
distances. In a detailed case study of a structure comprising a slab of
GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well (MQW) material, we find propagation lengths
of 100s of mm. In addition, the electric field enhancement associated with the
plasmonic resonance is found to be sufficient to induce the condition of strong
coupling between the slab modes and the intersubband transitions in the MQWs.",2007-01-22T15:24:43Z
Nearby low-mass triple system GJ795,"We report the results of our optical speckle-interferometric observations of
the nearby triple system GJ795 performed with the 6-m BTA telescope with
diffraction-limited angular resolution. The three components of the system were
optically resolved for the first time. Position measurements allowed us to
determine the elements of the inner orbit of the triple system. We use the
measured magnitude differences to estimate the absolute magnitudes and spectral
types of the components of the triple: $M_{V}^{Aa}$=7.31$\pm$0.08,
$M_{V}^{Ab}$=8.66$\pm$0.10, $M_{V}^{B}$=8.42$\pm$0.10, $Sp_{Aa}$ $\approx$K5,
$Sp_{Ab}$ $\approx$K9, $Sp_{B}$ $\approx$K8. The total mass of the system is
equal to $\Sigma\mathcal{M}_{AB}$=1.69$\pm0.27\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$. We show
GJ795 to be a hierarchical triple system which satisfies the empirical
stability criteria.",2007-03-15T18:54:42Z

terms of axis-data.",2007-01-20T18:34:27Z
Reentrant stability of superconducting films,"We propose a mechanism responsible for the abrupt vanishing of the dendritic
flux instability found in many superconducting films when an increasing
magnetic field is applied. The onset of flux avalanches and the subsequent
reentrance of stability in NbN films was investigated using magneto-optical
imaging, and the threshold fields were measured as functions of critical
current density, $j_c$. The results are explained with excellent quantitative
agreement by a thermomagnetic model published recently, Phys. Rev. B73, 014512
(2006), showing that the reentrant stability is a direct consequence of a
monotonously decreasing $j_c$ versus field.",2007-02-28T15:34:49Z
Zero-bias anomaly in the tunneling density of states of graphene,"In the vicinity of the Fermi energy, the band structure of graphene is well
described by a Dirac equation. Impurities will generally induce both a scalar
potential as well as a (fictitious) gauge field acting on the Dirac fermions.
We show that the angular dependence of the zero-bias anomaly in the spatially
resolved tunneling density of states (TDOS) around a particular impurity allows
one to distinguish between these two contributions. Our predictions can be
tested in scanning-tunneling-microscopy measurements on graphene.",2007-02-01T15:07:49Z
The Simplest Solution to an Underdetermined System of Linear Equations,"Consider a d*n matrix A, with d<n. The problem of solving for x in y=Ax is
underdetermined, and has infinitely many solutions (if there are any). Given y,
the minimum Kolmogorov complexity solution (MKCS) of the input x is defined to
be an input z (out of many) with minimum Kolmogorov-complexity that satisfies
y=Az. One expects that if the actual input is simple enough, then MKCS will
recover the input exactly. This paper presents a preliminary study of the
existence and value of the complexity level up to which such a complexity-based
recovery is possible. It is shown that for the set of all d*n binary matrices
(with entries 0 or 1 and d<n), MKCS exactly recovers the input for an
overwhelming fraction of the matrices provided the Kolmogorov complexity of the
input is O(d). A weak converse that is loose by a log n factor is also
established for this case. Finally, we investigate the difficulty of finding a
matrix that has the property of recovering inputs with complexity of O(d) using
MKCS.",2007-02-19T12:34:09Z
The Thermodynamical Limit of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model,"A method based on the analyzis of the Majorana polynomial roots is introduced
to compute the spectrum of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in the
thermodynamical limit. A rich structure made of four qualitatively different
regions is revealed in the parameter space whereas the ground state study only
distinguishes between two phases.",2007-03-19T17:23:30Z
A First Step Towards Automatically Building Network Representations,"To fully harness Grids, users or middlewares must have some knowledge on the
topology of the platform interconnection network. As such knowledge is usually
not available, one must uses tools which automatically build a topological
network model through some measurements. In this article, we define a
methodology to assess the quality of these network model building tools, and we
apply this methodology to representatives of the main classes of model builders
and to two new algorithms. We show that none of the main existing techniques
build models that enable to accurately predict the running time of simple
application kernels for actual platforms. However some of the new algorithms we
propose give excellent results in a wide range of situations.",2007-02-13T16:35:04Z
Model for l/f Flux Noise in SQUIDs and Qubits,"We propose a model for 1/f flux noise in superconducting devices (f is
frequency). The noise is generated by the magnetic moments of electrons in
defect states which they occupy for a wide distribution of times before
escaping. A trapped electron occupies one of the two Kramers-degenerate ground
states, between which the transition rate is negligible at low temperature. As
a result, the magnetic moment orientation is locked. Simulations of the noise
produced by randomly oriented defects with a density of 5*10^17 m^-2 yield 1/f
noise magnitudes in good agreement with experiments.",2007-02-01T17:56:41Z
"Ensembles of plasmonic nanospheres at optical frequencies and a problem
  of negative index behavior","Arrays of metallic nanoparticles support individual and collective plasmonic
excitations that contribute to unusual phenomena like surface enhanced Raman
scattering, anomalous transparency, negative index, and subwavelength
resolution in various metamaterials. We have examined the electromagnetic
response of dual Kron's lattice and films containing up to three monolayers of
metallic nanospheres. It appears that open cubic Kron's lattice exhibits `soft'
electromagnetic response but no negative index behavior. The close-packed
arrays behave similarly: there are plasmon resonances and very high
transmission at certain wavelengths that are much larger than the separation
between the particles, and a `soft' magnetic response, with small but positive
effective index of refraction. It would be interesting to check those
predictions experimentally.",2007-01-09T21:05:14Z
"The Effect of Nanoparticle Shape on Polymer-Nanocomposite Rheology and
  Tensile Strength","Nanoparticles can influence the properties of polymer materials by a variety
of mechanisms. With fullerene, carbon nanotube, and clay or graphene sheet
nanocomposites in mind, we investigate how particle shape influences the melt
shear viscosity $\eta$ and the tensile strength $\tau$, which we determine via
molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations of compact (icosahedral), tube
or rod-like, and sheet-like model nanoparticles indicate an order of magnitude
increase in the viscosity $\eta$ relative to the pure melt. This finding
evidently can not be explained by continuum hydrodynamics and we provide
evidence that the $\eta$ increase in our model nanocomposites has its origin in
chain bridging between the nanoparticles. We find that this increase is the
largest for the rod-like nanoparticles and least for the sheet-like
nanoparticles. Curiously, the enhancements of $\eta$ and $\tau$ exhibit {\it
opposite trends} with increasing chain length $N$ and with particle shape
anisotropy. Evidently, the concept of bridging chains alone cannot account for
the increase in $\tau$ and we suggest that the deformability or flexibility of
the sheet nanoparticles contributes to nanocomposite strength and toughness by
reducing the relative value of the Poisson ratio of the composite. Our
simulations point to a substantial contribution of nanoparticle shape to both
mechanical and processing properties of polymer nanocomposites.",2007-01-24T23:35:03Z
Instanton and Superconductivity in Supersymmetric CP(N-1) Model,"The two dimensional supersymmetric CP(N-1) model has a striking similarity to
the N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions. The BPS mass formula
and the curve of the marginal stability (CMS), which exist in the four
dimensional gauge theory, appears in this two dimensional CP(N-1) model. These
two quntities are derived by a one-dimensional n-vector spin model in the large
n limit for the N=2 case. This mapping is further investigated at the critical
point. An application of the study of the BPS mass formula is proposed to the
phenomena of the spin and charge separations in the Higgs phase.",2007-03-27T02:21:52Z
"Spin-Current-Induced Charge Accumulation and Electric Current in
  Semiconductor Nanostructures with Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling","We demonstrate that the flow of a longitudinal spin current with different
spin polarization will induce different patterns of charge accumulation in a
two-terminal strip, or electric current distribution in a four-terminal
Hall-bar structure, of two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling (RSOC). For an in-plane polarized spin current, charges will
accumulate either by the two lateral edges or around the center of the strip
structure while, for an out-of-plain polarized spin current, charge densities
will show opposite signs by the two lateral edges leading to a Hall voltage.
Our calculation offers a new route to experimentally detect or differentiate
pure spin currents with various spin polarization.",2007-01-15T17:39:42Z

transition, and of the oxygen mass ($^{16}$O, $^{18}$O). We quantitatively show
how the polaronic narrowing of the carrier bandwidth and the crystal lattice
micro-strains control the volume fractions of the mesoscopic ferro- and
antiferromagnetic clusters. A well-defined dip in the transition temperatures
and the suppression of all the types of long range ordering seen near the
MI-transition at $y\simeq0.9$ indicate a key role of the quenched disorder for
the formation of the long-scale phase separated state.",2007-01-11T14:08:06Z
"Reconstruction of Rb-Rb inter-atomic potential from ultracold Bose-gas
  collision","Scattering phase shifts obtained from 87Rb Bose-gas collision experiments are
used to reconstruct effective potentials resulting, self-consistently, in the
same scattering events observed in the experiments at a particular energy. We
have found that the interaction strength close to the origin suddenly changes
from repulsion to attraction when the collision energy crosses, from below, the
l=2 shape resonance position at E = 275 mikroK. This observation may be
utilized in outlining future Bose-gas collision experiments.",2007-02-24T07:21:53Z
Unitary Fermi gas in the epsilon expansion,"We construct systematic expansions around four and two spatial dimensions for
a Fermi gas near the unitarity limit. Near four spatial dimensions such a Fermi
gas can be understood as a weakly-interacting system of fermionic and bosonic
degrees of freedom. To the leading and next-to-leading orders in the expansion
over \epsilon=4-d, with d being the dimensionality of space, we determine the
thermodynamic functions, the fermion quasiparticle spectrum, the critical
polarizations, and the critical temperature as functions of the binding energy
of the two-body state. We also show that the unitary Fermi gas near two spatial
dimensions reduces to a weakly-interacting Fermi gas and calculate the
thermodynamic functions and the fermion quasiparticle spectrum in the expansion
over \bar\epsilon=d-2. We discuss the matching of the two systematic expansions
around four and two spatial dimensions in order to extract physical observables
at d=3. We find good agreement of the results with those from recent Monte
Carlo simulations.",2007-03-19T14:34:25Z
"Magneto-resistivity model and ionization energy approximation for
  ferromagnets","The evolution of resistivity versus temperature ($\rho(T)$) curve for
different doping elements, and in the presence of various defects and
clustering are explained for both diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) and
manganites. Here, we provide unambiguous evidence that the concept of
ionization energy ($E_I$), which is explicitly associated with the atomic
energy levels, can be related quantitatively to transport measurements. The
proposed ionization energy model is used to understand how the valence states
of ions affect the evolution of $\rho(T)$ curves for different doping elements.
We also explain how the $\rho(T)$ curves evolve in the presence of, and in the
absence of defects and clustering. The model also complements the results
obtained from first-principles calculations.",2007-01-22T11:35:48Z
"The Troublesome Broadband Evolution of GRB 061126: Does a Grey Burst
  Imply Grey Dust?","We report on observations of a gamma-ray burst (GRB 061126) with an extremely
bright (R ~ 12 mag at peak) early-time optical afterglow. The optical afterglow
is already fading as a power law 22 seconds after the trigger, with no
detectable prompt contribution in our first exposure, which was coincident with
a large prompt-emission gamma-ray pulse. The optical--infrared photometric
spectral energy distribution is an excellent fit to a power law, but it
exhibits a moderate red-to-blue evolution in the spectral index at about 500 s
after the burst. This color change is contemporaneous with a switch from a
relatively fast decay to slower decay. The rapidly decaying early afterglow is
broadly consistent with synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, but a bright
forward-shock component predicted by the intermediate- to late-time X-ray
observations under the assumptions of standard afterglow models is not
observed. Indeed, despite its remarkable early-time brightness, this burst
would qualify as a dark burst at later times on the basis of its nearly flat
optical-to-X-ray spectral index. Our photometric spectral energy distribution
provides no evidence of host-galaxy extinction, requiring either large
quantities of grey dust in the host system (at redshift 1.1588 +/- 0.0006,
based upon our late-time Keck spectroscopy) or separate physical origins for
the X-ray and optical afterglows.",2007-03-20T21:03:07Z
"Orbital Magnetism and Transport Phenomena in Two Dimensional Dirac
  Fermions in Weak Magnetic Field","We discuss the orbital magnetism and the Hall effect in the weak magnetic
field in two dimensional Dirac fermion systems with energy gap. This model is
related to the graphene sheet, organic conductors, and $d$-density wave
superconductors. We found the strong diamagnetism and finite Hall conductivity
even in gapped systems. We also discuss the relation between the weak-magnetic
field formalism and the Landau quantization with the Euler-Maclaurin expansion.",2007-03-14T14:27:43Z
"Two-Dimensional Superconducting Fluctuations in Stripe-Ordered
  La(1.875)Ba(0.125)CuO(4)","Recent spectroscopic observations of a d-wave-like gap in stripe-ordered
La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4) with x=1/8 have led us to critically analyze the anisotropic
transport and magnetization properties of this material. The data suggest that
concomitant with the spin ordering is an electronic decoupling of the CuO(2)
planes. We observe a transition (or crossover) to a state of two-dimensional
(2D) fluctuating superconductivity, which eventually reaches a 2D
superconducting state below a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Thus,
it appears that the stripe order in La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4) frustrates
three-dimensional superconducting phase order, but is fully compatible with 2D
superconductivity and an enhanced T_c.",2007-03-14T03:28:21Z
"The Shear Viscosity to Entropy Density Ratio of Trapped Fermions in the
  Unitarity Limit","We extract the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio \eta/s of cold
fermionic atoms in the unitarity limit from experimental data on the damping of
collective excitations. We find that near the critical temperature \eta/s is
roughly equal to 1/2 in units of \hbar/k_B. With the possible exception of the
quark gluon plasma, this value is closer to the conjectured lower bound
1/(4\pi) than any other known liquid.",2007-01-11T18:37:48Z
"Optical detection of the radio supernova SN 2000ft in the circumnuclear
  region of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 7469","SN 2000ft is detected in two independent Planetary Camera images (F547W and
F814W) taken May 13, 2000, about two months before the predicted date of the
explosion (July 19, 2000), based on the analysis of its radio light evolution
by Alberdi and collaborators. The apparent optical magnitudes and red color of
SN 2000ft indicate that it is observed through an extinction of at least A$_V$=
3.0 magnitudes. The extinction corrected lower limit to the absolute visual
magnitude (M$_V$ $\leq -$ 18.0), identifies SN 2000ft as a luminous supernova
in the optical, as other luminous radio supernovae before. SN 2000ft exploded
in a region located at only 0.1 arcsec (i.e. 34 +/- 3 pc) west of a faint
cluster (C24). No parent cluster is identified within the detection limits of
the HST short exposures. The unambiguous detection of SN 2000ft in the visual
shows that multi-epoch sub-arcsecond (FWHM less than 0.1 arcsec) optical
imaging is also a valid tool that should be explored further to detect
supernovae in the dusty (circum)nuclear regions of (U)LIRGs.",2007-03-19T08:38:40Z
Thermal dependence of the zero-bias conductance through a nanostructure,"We show that the conductance of a quantum wire side-coupled to a quantum dot,
with a gate potential favoring the formation of a dot magnetic moment, is a
universal function of the temperature. Universality prevails even if the
currents through the dot and the wire interfere. We apply this result to the
experimental data of Sato et al.[Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 066801 (2005)].",2007-01-22T18:13:37Z
"Linking Microscopic and Macroscopic Models for Evolution: Markov Chain
  Network Training and Conservation Law Approximations","In this paper, a general framework for the analysis of a connection between
the training of artificial neural networks via the dynamics of Markov chains
and the approximation of conservation law equations is proposed. This framework
allows us to demonstrate an intrinsic link between microscopic and macroscopic
models for evolution via the concept of perturbed generalized dynamic systems.
The main result is exemplified with a number of illustrative examples where
efficient numerical approximations follow directly from network-based
computational models, viewed here as Markov chain approximations. Finally,
stability and consistency conditions of such computational models are
discussed.",2007-02-25T11:19:25Z
Charge rearrangement and screening in a quantum point contact,"Compressibility measurements, sensitive to charge rearrangements, are
performed on a quantum point contact (QPC). Screening due to mobile charges in
the QPC is quantitatively measured, using a second point contact to detect the
screened electrical potential. These measurements are performed from pinch-off
through the opening of the first few modes in the QPC. While the measured
signal closely matches a Thomas-Fermi-Poisson prediction, deviations from the
classical behavior, in the form of additional dips, are apparent near the
openings of the different modes, with the largest dip at the opening of the
first mode. Density functional calculations attribute the first dip to exchange
interactions. The other dips reflect the diverging density of states at the
opening of each one-dimensional mode, which affects both kinetic and exchange
contributions to the energy.",2007-03-26T19:51:04Z
"Critical wetting of a class of nonequilibrium interfaces: A mean-field
  picture","A self-consistent mean-field method is used to study critical wetting
transitions under nonequilibrium conditions by analyzing Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
(KPZ) interfaces in the presence of a bounding substrate. In the case of
positive KPZ nonlinearity a single (Gaussian) regime is found. On the contrary,
interfaces corresponding to negative nonlinearities lead to three different
regimes of critical behavior for the surface order-parameter: (i) a trivial
Gaussian regime, (ii) a weak-fluctuation regime with a trivially located
critical point and nontrivial exponents, and (iii) a highly non-trivial
strong-fluctuation regime, for which we provide a full solution by finding the
zeros of parabolic-cylinder functions. These analytical results are also
verified by solving numerically the self-consistent equation in each case.
Analogies with and differences from equilibrium critical wetting as well as
nonequilibrium complete wetting are also discussed.",2007-03-15T10:31:17Z
Hole states in wide band-gap diluted magnetic semiconductors and oxides,"Puzzling disagreement between photoemission and optical findings in
magnetically doped GaN and ZnO is explained within a generalized alloy theory.
The obtained results show that the strong coupling between valence-band holes
and localized spins gives rise to a mid-gap Zhang-Rice-like state, to a sign
reversal of the apparent p-d exchange integral, and to an increase of the
band-gap with the magnetic ion concentration.",2007-03-11T21:58:26Z
"Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Folding and Diffusion of Proteins in
  Nanopores","A novel combination of discontinuous molecular dynamics and the Langevin
equation, together with an intermediate-resolution model, are used to carry out
long (several $\mu$s) simulation and study folding transition and transport of
proteins in slit nanopores. Both attractive ($U^+$) and repulsive ($U^-$)
interaction potentials between the proteins and the pore walls are considered.
Near the folding temperature $T_f$ and in the presence of $U^+$ the proteins
undergo a repeating sequence of folding/partially-folding/ unfolding
transitions, while $T_f$ decreases with decreasing pore sizes. The opposite is
true when $U^-$ is present. The proteins' effective diffusivity $D$ is computed
as a function of their length (number of the amino acid groups), temperature
$T$, the pore size, and the interaction potentials $U^\pm$. Far from $T_f$, $D$
increases (roughly) linearly with $T$, but due to the thermal fluctuations and
their effect on the proteins' structure near $T_f$, the dependence of $D$ on
$T$ in this region is nonlinear. Under certain conditions, transport of
proteins in smaller pores can be {\it faster} than that in larger pores.",2007-03-14T21:47:48Z
"Structure and energetics of solvated ferrous and ferric ions:
  Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics in the DFT+U formalism","We implemented a rotationally-invariant Hubbard U extension to
density-functional theory in the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics framework,
with the goal of bringing the accuracy of the DFT+U approach to
finite-temperature simulations, especially for liquids or solids containing
transition-metal ions. First, we studied the effects on the Hubbard U on the
static equilibrium structure of the hexa-aqua ferrous and ferric ions, and the
inner-sphere reorganization energy for the electron-transfer reaction between
aqueous ferrous and ferric ions. It is found that the reorganization energy is
increased, mostly as a result of the Fe-O distance elongation in the hexa-aqua
ferrous ion. Second, we performed a first-principles molecular dynamics study
of the solvation structure of the two aqueous ferrous and ferric ions. The
Hubbard term is found to change the Fe-O radial distribution function for the
ferrous ion, while having a negligible effect on the aqueous ferric ion.
Moreover, the frequencies of vibrations between Fe and oxygen atoms in the
first-solvation shell are shown to be unaffected by the Hubbard corrections for
both ferrous and ferric ions.",2007-01-12T00:52:42Z
"Even-odd effect in Andreev Transport through a Carbon Nanotube Quantum
  Dot","We have measured the current(I)-voltage(V) characteristics of a single-wall
carbon nanotube quantum dot coupled to superconducting source and drain
contacts in the intermediate coupling regime. Whereas the enhanced differential
conductance dI/dV due to the Kondo resonance is observed in the normal state,
this feature around zero bias voltage is absent in the superconducting state.
Nonetheless, a pronounced even-odd effect appears at finite bias in the $dI/dV$
sub-gap structure caused by Andreev reflection. The first-order Andreev peak
appearing around V=\Delta/e is markedly enhanced in gate-voltage regions, in
which the charge state of the quantum dot is odd. This enhancement is explained
by a `hidden' Kondo resonance, pinned to one contact only. A comparison with a
single-impurity Anderson model, which is solved numerically in a slave-boson
meanfield ansatz, yields good agreement with the experiment.",2007-03-02T22:33:56Z
"Kinetic Effects on Turbulence Driven by the Magnetorotational
  Instability in Black Hole Accretion","Magnetorotational Instability (MRI), the instability causing turbulent
transport in accretion disks, is studied in the kinetic regime. Radiatively
Inefficient Accretion Flows (RIAFs), like the one around the supermassive black
hole in the center of our Galaxy, are believed to be collisionless. Kinetic MHD
formalism, based on the moments of the Vlasov equation, is used for linear
analysis and nonlinear simulations.
  ZEUS MHD code is modified to include key kinetic MHD terms: anisotropic
pressure tensor and anisotropic thermal conduction. Simulations use the local
shearing box approximation. Pressure anisotropy is created, because of the
adiabatic invariance ($\mu=p_\perp/B$), as magnetic field is amplified by the
MRI. Larmor radius scale instabilities--mirror, ion-cyclotron, and
firehose--are excited at large pressure anisotropy. Pressure isotropization due
to pitch angle scattering by these instabilities is included as a subgrid
model. A key result of the kinetic MHD simulations is that the anisotropic
(viscous) stress can be as large as the Maxwell stress.
  A new numerical method to simulate anisotropic thermal conduction with large
temperature gradients is suggested. Simple tests show that the centered
differencing of anisotropic thermal conduction can result in heat flowing from
lower to higher temperatures, giving rise to negative temperatures. Limiting of
transverse temperature gradients does not accentuate temperature extrema.",2007-03-20T23:14:21Z
"Composition and reactivity on Pd/Au(111) surface: A first-principle
  study","Atomic configurations of two or three Pd substituents on the Au(111) surface
are investigated using the first-principles pseudopotential plane wave
approach. Pd atoms are found to form second neighborhoods on PdAu(111). The
Pd-d band becomes narrow and well below the Fermi level, very different from
those in a Pd film or bulk Pd. Nevertheless, surface Pd atoms are still active
and serve as independent attractive centers towards adsorbates. The special
ensembles are important for catalysis applications because of their ability to
confine reactants in a small region.",2007-01-31T09:42:41Z
Entanglement entropy of the random spin-1 Heisenberg chain,"Random spin chains at quantum critical points exhibit an entanglement entropy
between a segment of length L and the rest of the chain that scales as log_2 L
with a universal coefficient. Since for pure quantum critical spin chains this
coefficient is fixed by the central charge of the associated conformal field
theory, the universal coefficient in the random case can be understood as an
effective central charge. In this paper we calculate the entanglement entropy
and effective central charge of the spin-1 random Heisenberg model in its
random-singlet phase and also at the critical point at which the Haldane phase
breaks down. The latter is the first entanglement calculation for an
infinite-randomness fixed point that is not in the random-singlet universality
class. Our results are consistent with a c-theorem for flow between
infinite-randomness fixed points. The formalism we use can be generally applied
to calculation of quantities that depend on the RG history in s>=1 random
Heisenberg chains.",2007-03-01T21:05:04Z
"First-principles calculations of Cu(001) thin films: quantum size effect
  in surface energetics and surface chemical reactivities","First-principles calculations of Cu(001) free-standing thin films have been
performed to investigate the oscillatory quantum size effects exhibited in
surface energy, work function, atomic relaxation, and adsorption energy of the
cesium adsorbate. The quantum well states have been shown and clarified at
particular $k$-points corresponding to the stationary extrema in bulk Brillouin
zone, which are in good agreement with experimental observations. The
calculated surface energetics and geometry relaxations are clearly featured by
quantum oscillations as a function of the film thickness of the film with
oscillation periods characterized by a superposition of long and short length
scales. Furthermore, we have investigated Cs adsorption onto Cu(001) thin films
as a function of the film thickness. Our systematic calculated results clearly
show the large-amplitude quantum oscillations in adsorption energetics, which
may be used to tailor catalysis, chemical reactions and other surface processes
in nanostructured materials.",2007-01-13T07:06:36Z
Dynamical scaling in branching models for seismicity,"We propose a branching process based on a dynamical scaling hypothesis
relating time and mass. In the context of earthquake occurrence, we show that
experimental power laws in size and time distribution naturally originate
solely from this scaling hypothesis. We present a numerical protocol able to
generate a synthetic catalog with an arbitrary large number of events. The
numerical data reproduce the hierarchical organization in time and magnitude of
experimental inter-event time distribution.",2007-01-30T10:34:25Z
"Bright globular clusters in NGC 5128: the missing link between young
  massive clusters and evolved massive objects","In order to investigate whether the brightest globular clusters (GCs) in the
giant elliptical galaxies are similar to the less luminous GCs like those found
in Local Group galaxies, we study the velocity dispersion and structural
parameter correlations of a sample of bright GCs in the nearest gE galaxy NGC
5128. UVES echelle spectrograph on the ESO VLT, and EMMI on the ESO NTT were
used to obtain high resolution spectra of bright GCs in NGC 5128. The velocity
dispersions were obtained for all the targets. The structural parameters were
either taken from the existing literature, or derived from our VLT FORS1 images
using the ISHAPE software. The velocity dispersion and structural parameter
measurements were used to obtain masses and M/L_V ratios of 22 clusters. The
masses of the clusters in our sample range from M_vir=10^5-10^7 M_sun and the
average M/L_V is 3+/-1. The three GCs harbouring X-ray point sources are the
second, third and sixth most massive in our sample. The most massive cluster,
HCH99-18, is also the brightest and the largest in size. It has the mass
(M_vir=1.4x10^7 M_sun) an order of magnitude larger than the most massive
clusters in the Local Group, and a high M/L_V ratio (4.7+/-1.2). We discuss
briefly possible formation scenarios for this object. The correlations of
structural parameters, velocity dispersion, masses and M/L_V for the bright GCs
in NGC 5128 extend the properties established for the most massive Local Group
clusters towards those characteristic of dE galaxy nuclei and Ultra Compact
Dwarfs (UCDs). The detection of the mass-radius and the mass-M/L_V relations
for the GCs with masses greater than ~2x10^6 M_sun provides the missing link
between ``normal'' old globular clusters, young massive clusters, and evolved
objects like UCDs. (Abridged)",2007-03-15T08:38:21Z
"Multimodal Meaning Representation for Generic Dialogue Systems
  Architectures","An unified language for the communicative acts between agents is essential
for the design of multi-agents architectures. Whatever the type of interaction
(linguistic, multimodal, including particular aspects such as force feedback),
whatever the type of application (command dialogue, request dialogue, database
querying), the concepts are common and we need a generic meta-model. In order
to tend towards task-independent systems, we need to clarify the modules
parameterization procedures. In this paper, we focus on the characteristics of
a meta-model designed to represent meaning in linguistic and multimodal
applications. This meta-model is called MMIL for MultiModal Interface Language,
and has first been specified in the framework of the IST MIAMM European
project. What we want to test here is how relevant is MMIL for a completely
different context (a different task, a different interaction type, a different
linguistic domain). We detail the exploitation of MMIL in the framework of the
IST OZONE European project, and we draw the conclusions on the role of MMIL in
the parameterization of task-independent dialogue managers.",2007-03-16T15:37:47Z
RPAE versus RPA for the Tomonaga model with quadratic energy dispersion,"Recently the damping of the collective charge (and spin) modes of interacting
fermions in one spatial dimension was studied. It results from the nonlinear
correction to the energy dispersion in the vicinity of the Fermi points. To
investigate the damping one has to replace the random phase approximation (RPA)
bare bubble by a sum of more complicated diagrams. It is shown here that a
better starting point than the bare RPA is to use the (conserving) linearized
time dependent Hartree-Fock equations, i.e. to perform a random phase
approximation (with) exchange
  (RPAE) calculation. It is shown that the RPAE equation can be solved
analytically for the special form of the two-body interaction often used in the
Luttinger liquid framework. While (bare) RPA and RPAE agree for the case of a
strictly linear disperson there are qualitative differences for the case of the
usual nonrelativistic quadratic dispersion.",2007-02-21T10:34:57Z
"Colloids with key-lock interactions: non-exponential relaxation, aging
  and anomalous diffusion","The dynamics of particles interacting by key-lock binding of attached
biomolecules are studied theoretically. Experimental realizations of such
systems include colloids grafted with complementary single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA), and particles grafted with antibodies to cell-membrane proteins.
Depending on the coverage of the functional groups, we predict two distinct
regimes. In the low coverage localized regime, there is an exponential
distribution of departure times. As the coverage is increased the system enters
a diffusive regime resulting from the interplay of particle desorption and
diffusion. This interplay leads to much longer bound state lifetimes, a
phenomenon qualitatively similar to aging in glassy systems. The diffusion
behavior is analogous to dispersive transport in disordered semiconductors:
depending on the interaction parameters it may range from a finite
renormalization of the diffusion coefficient to anomalous, subdiffusive
behavior. We make connections to recent experiments and discuss the
implications for future studies.",2007-02-23T23:35:24Z
"Coherent electron dynamics in a two-dimensional random system with
  mobility edges","We study numerically the dynamics of a one-electron wave packet in a
two-dimensional random lattice with long-range correlated diagonal disorder in
the presence of a uniform electric field. The time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger
equation is used for this purpose. We find that the wave packet displays
Bloch-like oscillations associated with the appearance of a phase of
delocalized states in the strong correlation regime. The amplitude of
oscillations directly reflects the bandwidth of the phase and allows to measure
it. The oscillations reveal two main frequencies whose values are determined by
the structure of the underlying potential in the vicinity of the wave packet
maximum.",2007-01-10T13:50:33Z
"Universal behavior of $\rm CePd_{1-x}Rh_x$ Ferromagnet at Quantum
  Critical Point","The heavy-fermion metal $\rm CePd_{1-x}Rh_x$ can be tuned from ferromagnetism
at $x=0$ to non-magnetic state at some critical concentration $x_c$. The
non-Fermi liquid behavior (NFL) at $x\simeq x_c$ is recognized by power low
dependence of the specific heat $C(T)$ given by the electronic contribution,
magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$ and volume expansion coefficient $\alpha(T)$
at low temperatures: $C/T\propto\chi(T)\propto\alpha(T)/T\propto1/\sqrt{T}$. We
also demonstrate that the behavior of normalized effective mass $M^*_N$
observed in $\rm CePd_{1-x}Rh_x$ at $x\simeq 0.8$ agrees with that of $M^*_N$
observed in paramagnetic $\rm CeRu_2Si_2$ and conclude that these alloys
exhibit the universal NFL thermodynamic behavior at their quantum critical
points. We show that the NFL behavior of $\rm CePd_{1-x}Rh_x$ can be accounted
for within frameworks of quasiparticle picture and fermion condensation quantum
phase transition, while this alloy exhibits a universal thermodynamic NFL
behavior which is independent of the characteristic features of the given alloy
such as its lattice structure, magnetic ground state, dimension etc.",2007-03-18T22:38:01Z
"On the accuracy of first-principles lateral interactions: Oxygen at
  Pd(100)","We employ a first-principles lattice-gas Hamiltonian (LGH) approach to
determine the lateral interactions between O atoms adsorbed on the Pd(100)
surface. With these interactions we obtain an ordering behavior at low coverage
that is in quantitative agreement with experimental data. Uncertainties in the
approach arise from the finite LGH expansion and from the approximate
exchange-correlation (xc) functional underlying the employed density-functional
theory energetics. We carefully scrutinize these uncertainties and conclude
that they primarily affect the on-site energy, which rationalizes the agreement
with the experimental critical temperatures for the order-disorder transition.
We also investigate the validity of the frequently applied assumption that the
ordering energies can be represented by a sum of pair terms. Restricting our
LGH expansion to just pairwise lateral interactions, we find that this results
in effective interactions which contain spurious contributions that are of
equal size, if not larger than any of the uncertainties e.g. due to the
approximate xc functional.",2007-01-23T12:57:34Z

"Numerical study of drying process and columnar fracture process in
  granules-water mixtures","The formation of three-dimensional prismatic cracks in the drying process of
starch-water mixtures is investigated numerically. We assume that the mixture
is an elastic porous medium which possesses a stress field and a water content
field. The evolution of both fields are represented by a spring network and a
phenomenological model with the water potential, respectively. We find that the
water content distribution has a propagating front which is not explained by a
simple diffusion process. The prismatic structure of cracks driven by the water
content field is observed. The depth dependence and the coarsening process of
the columnar structure are also studied. The particle diameter dependence of
the scale of the columns and the effect of the crack networks on the dynamics
of the water content field are also discussed.",2007-02-05T00:07:17Z
Multiple-source optical spectral weight transfer in ferromagnetic EuB6,"We present the first wide range (2 meV$-$5.5 eV) optical conductivity of
EuB$_6$ from reflectivity and ellipsometry measurements. Upon the ferromagnetic
transition at T$_{c}$=15.5 K, interband transition $\sigma_{1}(\omega)$
decreases at three different energy $\omega$=0.5, 1.4, 2.75 eV and the lost
spectral weight is transferred to the Drude $\sigma_{1}(\omega)$ at
$\omega<$0.33 eV. We succeeded in explaining this unprecedented multiple-energy
$\sigma_{1}(\omega)$ change using LDA+U calculated band structure by Kunes and
Pickett (Phys. Rev. B, $\textbf{69}$,165111). Our finding supports strongly
that (1) EuB$_6$ is a semimetal and (2) the exchange-driven band splitting is
the primary source of the drastic $\rho(T)$ and $\omega_{p}^{2}$ changes at T
$<$ T$_{c}$.",2007-03-10T20:08:04Z
"Excitons in QED3 and spin response in a phase-fluctuating d-wave

"Doping induced magnetic clusters and Co spin state transition in
  Na_xCoO_2 with 0.78<x<.97","By muon spin rotation we investigated the magnetic properties of a series of
highly Na doped NaxCoO2 single crystals with 0.78(1)<x<0.97(1). Our data
provide evidence for an intrinsically inhomogeneous magnetic state which can be
described in tems of hole doping (Na vacancy) induced magnetic clusters that
percolate at 1-x>0.04 until they yield a bulk magnetic state near x=0.78.
Evidence for a strong (likely geometrical) frustration of the magnetic order is
obtained from the anomalous doping dependence of the spin fluctuation rate
(above the ordering temperature) which is strongly enhanced at x=0.78 as
compared to x=0.97.",2007-01-02T12:00:20Z
"Cassini States with Dissipation: Why Obliquity Tides Cannot Inflate Hot
  Jupiters","Some short-period exoplanets (hot Jupiters) are observed by their transits to
have anomalously large radii. It has been suggested that these planets are in a
resonance involving persistent misalignment and synchronous precession of their
spin and orbital angular momenta, a Cassini state, and that the attendant tidal
heating inflates the planet. We argue against this. Using explicit tidal
integrations, we show that although an oblique Cassini state can dissipate many
times the rotational energy of the planet, the rate of dissipation must be much
less than hypothesized. Dissipation causes the planetary spin to lie at an
angle to the plane containing the orbital and total angular momenta. If
dissipation is too rapid, this angle becomes so large that Cassini equilibrium
is lost. A separate consideration limits the total energy that can be extracted
from the orbit. The source of the torque on the orbit, either an oblique parent
star or an inclined third body, aligns with the orbit as it absorbs the angular
momentum shed by the planet. Alignment removes the orbital precession required
by the Cassini state. In combination with observational bounds on the mass and
semimajor axis of a possible second planet and with bounds on the stellar
rotation and obliquity, these constraints make it very unlikely that obliquity
tides can be the explanation for inflated hot Jupiters, especially HD 209458b.",2007-03-16T13:53:44Z
A Triple Main Sequence in the Globular Cluster NGC 2808,"Accurate photometry with HST/ACS shows that the main sequence of the globular
cluster NGC 2808 splits into three separate branches. The three MS branches may
be associated with complexities of the cluster's horizontal branch and of its
abundance distribution. We attribute the MS branches to successive rounds of
star formation, with different helium abundances; we discuss possible sources
of helium enrichment. Some other massive globulars also appear to have complex
populations; we compare them with NGC 2808.",2007-03-29T16:20:07Z
"Metal clusters, quantum dots and trapped atoms -- from single-particle
  models to correlatio","In this review, we discuss the electronic structure of finite quantal systems
on the nanoscale. After a few general remarks on the many-particle physics of
the harmonic oscillator -- likely being the most studied example for the
many-body systems of finite quantal systems, we discuss properties of metal
clusters, quantum dots and cold atoms in traps. We address magic numbers, shape
deformation, magnetism, particle localization, and vortex formation in rotating
systems.",2007-03-12T11:24:23Z
Static and dynamic aspects of transonicity in Bondi accretion,"Transonicity in a spherically symmetric accreting system has been considered
in both the stationary and the dynamic regimes. The stationary flow, set up as
a dynamical system, has been shown to be greatly unstable to even the minutest
possible deviation in the boundary condition for transonicity. With the help of
a simple analytical model, and some numerical modelling, it has then been
argued that the flow indeed becomes transonic and stable, when the evolution of
the flow is followed through time. The time-dependent approach also shows that
there is a remarkable closeness between an equation of motion for a
perturbation in the flow, and the metric of an analog acoustic black hole.",2007-03-13T09:58:18Z
Models of diffusion of galactic Cosmic Rays from Super-bubbles,"Super-bubbles are shells in the interstellar medium produced by the
simultaneous explosions of many supernova remnants. The solutions of the
mathematical diffusion and of the Fourier expansion in 1D, 2D and 3D were
deduced in order to describe the diffusion of nucleons from such structures.
The mean number of visits in the the case of the Levy flights in 1D was
computed with a Monte Carlo simulation. The diffusion of cosmic rays has its
physical explanation in the relativistic Larmor gyro-radius which is energy
dependent. The mathematical solution of the diffusion equation in 1D with
variable diffusion coefficient was computed. Variable diffusion coefficient
means magnetic field variable with the altitude from the Galactic plane. The
analytical solutions allow us to calibrate the code that describes the Monte
Carlo diffusion.
  The maximum energy that can be extracted from the super-bubbles is deduced.
The concentration of cosmic rays is a function of the distance from the nearest
super-bubble and the selected energy. The interaction of the cosmic rays on the
target material allows us to trace the theoretical map of the diffuse Galactic
continuum gamma-rays. The streaming of the cosmic rays from the Gould Belts
that contains the sun at it's internal was described by a Monte Carlo
simulation. Nine new formulas are derived.",2007-03-14T11:29:15Z
Graph Partitioning Induced Phase Transitions,"We study the percolation properties of graph partitioning on random regular
graphs with N vertices of degree $k$. Optimal graph partitioning is directly
related to optimal attack and immunization of complex networks. We find that
for any partitioning process (even if non-optimal) that partitions the graph
into equal sized connected components (clusters), the system undergoes a
percolation phase transition at $f=f_c=1-2/k$ where $f$ is the fraction of
edges removed to partition the graph. For optimal partitioning, at the
percolation threshold, we find $S \sim N^{0.4}$ where $S$ is the size of the
clusters and $\ell\sim N^{0.25}$ where $\ell$ is their diameter. Additionally,
we find that $S$ undergoes multiple non-percolation transitions for $f<f_c$.",2007-02-17T23:28:56Z
"Condensed Matter Physics With Light And Atoms: Strongly Correlated Cold
  Fermions in Optical Lattices","Various topics at the interface between condensed matter physics and the
physics of ultra-cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices are discussed. The
lectures start with basic considerations on energy scales, and on the regimes
in which a description by an effective Hubbard model is valid. Qualitative
ideas about the Mott transition are then presented, both for bosons and
fermions, as well as mean-field theories of this phenomenon. Antiferromagnetism
of the fermionic Hubbard model at half-filling is briefly reviewed. The
possibility that interaction effects facilitate adiabatic cooling is discussed,
and the importance of using entropy as a thermometer is emphasized. Geometrical
frustration of the lattice, by suppressing spin long-range order, helps
revealing genuine Mott physics and exploring unconventional quantum magnetism.
The importance of measurement techniques to probe quasiparticle excitations in
cold fermionic systems is emphasized, and a recent proposal based on stimulated
Raman scattering briefly reviewed. The unconventional nature of these
excitations in cuprate superconductors is emphasized.",2007-02-05T23:27:12Z
"Structure and Problem Hardness: Goal Asymmetry and DPLL Proofs in<br>
  SAT-Based Planning","In Verification and in (optimal) AI Planning, a successful method is to
formulate the application as boolean satisfiability (SAT), and solve it with
state-of-the-art DPLL-based procedures. There is a lack of understanding of why
this works so well. Focussing on the Planning context, we identify a form of
problem structure concerned with the symmetrical or asymmetrical nature of the
cost of achieving the individual planning goals. We quantify this sort of
structure with a simple numeric parameter called AsymRatio, ranging between 0
and 1. We run experiments in 10 benchmark domains from the International
Planning Competitions since 2000; we show that AsymRatio is a good indicator of
SAT solver performance in 8 of these domains. We then examine carefully crafted
synthetic planning domains that allow control of the amount of structure, and
that are clean enough for a rigorous analysis of the combinatorial search
space. The domains are parameterized by size, and by the amount of structure.
The CNFs we examine are unsatisfiable, encoding one planning step less than the
length of the optimal plan. We prove upper and lower bounds on the size of the
best possible DPLL refutations, under different settings of the amount of
structure, as a function of size. We also identify the best possible sets of
branching variables (backdoors). With minimum AsymRatio, we prove exponential
lower bounds, and identify minimal backdoors of size linear in the number of
variables. With maximum AsymRatio, we identify logarithmic DPLL refutations
(and backdoors), showing a doubly exponential gap between the two structural
extreme cases. The reasons for this behavior -- the proof arguments --
illuminate the prototypical patterns of structure causing the empirical
behavior observed in the competition benchmarks.",2007-01-29T12:47:08Z
"The Relativistic Generalization of the Gravitational Force for Arbitrary
  Spacetimes","It has been suggested that re-expressing relativity in terms of forces could
provide fresh insights. The formalism developed for this purpose only applied
to static, or conformally static, space-times. Here we extend it to arbitrary
space-times. It is hoped that this formalism may lead to a workable definition
of mass and energy in relativity.",2007-01-12T08:05:03Z
"Apsidal Behavior Among Planetary Orbits: Testing the Planet-Planet
  Scattering Model","Planets in extrasolar systems tend to interact such that their orbits lie
near a boundary between apsidal libration and circulation, a ""separatrix"", with
one eccentricity periodically reaching near-zero. One explanation, applied to
the Upsilon Andromedae system, assumed three original planets on circular
orbits. One is ejected, leaving the other two with near-separatrix behavior. We
test that model by integrating hundreds of hypothetical, unstable planetary
systems that eject a planet. We find that the probability that the remaining
planets exhibit near-separatrix motion is small (< 5% compared with nearly 50%
of observed systems). Moreover, while observed librating systems are evenly
divided between aligned and anti-aligned pericenter longitudes, the scattering
model strongly favors alignment. Alternative scattering theories are proposed,
which may provide a more satisfactory fit with observed systems.",2007-03-01T20:02:11Z
"Superfluid Insulator Transitions of Hard-Core Bosons on the Checkerboard
  Lattice","We study hard-core bosons on the checkerboard lattice with nearest neighbour
unfrustrated hopping $t$ and `tetrahedral' plaquette charging energy $U$.
Analytical arguments and Quantum Monte Carlo simulations lead us to the
conclusion that the system undergoes a zero temperature ($T$) quantum phase
transition from a superfluid phase at small $U/t$ to a large $U/t$ Mott
insulator phase with $\rho$ = 1/4 for a range of values of the chemical
potential $\mu$. Further, the quarter-filled insulator breaks lattice
translation symmetry in a characteristic four-fold ordering pattern, and
occupies a lobe of finite extent in the $\mu$-$U/t$ phase diagram. A Quantum
Monte-Carlo study slightly away from the tip of the lobe provides evidence for
a direct weakly first-order superfluid-insulator transition away from the tip
of the lobe. While analytical arguments leads us to conclude that the
transition {\em at} the tip of the lobe belongs to a different landau-forbidden
second-order universality class, an extrapolation of our numerical results
suggests that the size of the first-order jump does not go to zero even at the
tip of the lobe.",2007-01-19T13:00:11Z
Effect of interaction shape on the condensed DNA toroid,"We investigate how different microscopic interactions between semiflexible
chain segments can qualitatively alter the physical properties of the condensed
toroid. We propose a general form of the Hamiltonian of the toroid and discuss
its analytic properties. For different interactions, the theory predicts
different scaling behaviours of the mean toroidal and cross sectional radii,
$r_c$ and $r_{cross}$, as functions of the contour length L: $(r_c, r_{cross})
\sim L^{\nu(N_c)}$ with $\nu=(1/5, 2/5)$ for the van der Waals type,
$\nu=(-1/3, 2/3)$ for the Coulomb type, $\nu=(-1, 1)$ for the delta function
type attractions in the asymptotic limit. For the toroids with finite winding
number $N_c=100 \sim 400$, we find $\nu \simeq 0$ for the Yukawa interaction
with screening parameter $\kappa=0.5 \sim 1.0$, and $\nu=0.1 \sim 0.13$ for the
van der Waals type interactions. These findings could provide possible
explanation for the experimentally well known observation $\nu \simeq 0$ of the
condensed DNA toroids. Conformational transitions are also discussed.",2007-01-30T09:04:48Z
Finding low-weight polynomial multiples using discrete logarithm,"Finding low-weight multiples of a binary polynomial is a difficult problem
arising in the context of stream ciphers cryptanalysis. The classical algorithm
to solve this problem is based on a time memory trade-off. We will present an
improvement to this approach using discrete logarithm rather than a direct
representation of the involved polynomials. This gives an algorithm which
improves the theoretical complexity, and is also very flexible in practice.",2007-01-10T09:17:59Z
Dynamic spin susceptibility of paramagnetic spinel LiV2O4,"In an attempt to explain inelastic neutron scattering data for LiV2O4 the
dynamical spin susceptibility \chi(Q,w) at zero temperature is calculated.
Starting point is a weak coupling approach based on the LDA bandstructure for
that material. It is supplemented by a RPA treatment of local on-site
interactions and contains an adjustable parameter. Due to the geometrically
frustrated lattice structure the magnetic response is strongly enhanced in the
vicinity of a nearly spherical surface in Q-space. We compare these results
with recent low-temperature neutron scattering data. The measured spin
relaxation rate \Gamma is used to estimate the spin fluctuation contribution to
the specific heat.",2007-03-17T10:29:43Z
"A microscopically-based, global landscape perspective on slow dynamics
  in condensed matter","A complete understanding of the precipitous onset of slow dynamics in systems
such as supercooled liquids requires making direct connections between dynamics
and the underlying potential energy landscape. With the aid of a switch in
ensembles, we show that it is possible to formulate a landscape-based mechanism
for the onset of slow dynamics based on the rapid lengthening of the geodesic
paths that traverse the landscape. We confirm the usefulness of this purely
geometric analysis by showing that it successfully predicts the diffusion
constants of a standard model supercooled liquid.",2007-02-08T14:34:08Z
"Triaxial nuclear models and the outer crust of nonaccreting cold neutron
  stars","The properties and composition of the outer crust of nonaccreting cold
neutron stars are studied by applying the model of Baym, Pethick, and
Sutherland (BPS) and taking into account for the first time triaxial
deformations of nuclei. Two theoretical nuclear models, Hartree-Fock plus
pairing in the BCS approximation (HF-BCS) with Skyrme SLy6 parametrization and
Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB) with Gogny D1S force, are used to calculate the
nuclear masses. The two theoretical calculations are compared concerning their
neutron drip line, binding energies, magic neutron numbers, and the sequence of
nuclei in the outer crust of nonaccreting cold neutron stars, with special
emphasis on the effect of triaxial deformations. The BPS model is extended by
the higher-order corrections for the atomic binding, screening, exchange and
zero-point energies. The influence of the higher-order corrections on the
sequence of the outer crust is investigated.",2007-03-15T13:08:07Z
"How to calculate the fractal dimension of a complex network: the box
  covering algorithm","Covering a network with the minimum possible number of boxes can reveal
interesting features for the network structure, especially in terms of
self-similar or fractal characteristics. Considerable attention has been
recently devoted to this problem, with the finding that many real networks are
self-similar fractals. Here we present, compare and study in detail a number of
algorithms that we have used in previous papers towards this goal. We show that
this problem can be mapped to the well-known graph coloring problem and then we
simply can apply well-established algorithms. This seems to be the most
efficient method, but we also present two other algorithms based on burning
which provide a number of other benefits. We argue that the presented
algorithms provide a solution close to optimal and that another algorithm that
can significantly improve this result in an efficient way does not exist. We
offer to anyone that finds such a method to cover his/her expenses for a 1-week
trip to our lab in New York (details in http://jamlab.org).",2007-01-10T17:44:00Z
"Reaction rate uncertainties and the operation of the NeNa and MgAl
  chains during HBB in intermediate-mass AGB stars","We test the effect of proton-capture reaction rate uncertainties on the
abundances of the Ne, Na, Mg and Al isotopes processed by the NeNa and MgAl
chains during hot bottom burning (HBB) in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars
of intermediate mass between 4 and 6 solar masses and metallicities between
Z=0.0001 and 0.02. We provide uncertainty ranges for the AGB stellar yields,
for inclusion in galactic chemical evolution models, and indicate which
reaction rates are most important and should be better determined. We use a
fast synthetic algorithm based on detailed AGB models. We run a large number of
stellar models, varying one reaction per time for a very fine grid of values,
as well as all reactions simultaneously. We show that there are uncertainties
in the yields of all the Ne, Na, Mg and Al isotopes due to uncertain
proton-capture reaction rates. The most uncertain yields are those of 26Al and
23Na (variations of two orders of magnitude), 24Mg and 27Al (variations of more
than one order of magnitude), 20Ne and 22Ne (variations between factors 2 and
7). In order to obtain more reliable Ne, Na, Mg and Al yields from IM-AGB stars
the rates that require more accurate determination are: 22Ne(p,g)23Na,
23Na(p,g)24Mg, 25Mg(p,g)26Al, 26Mg(p,g)27Al and 26Al(p,g)27Si. Detailed
galactic chemical evolution models should be constructed to address the impact
of our uncertainty ranges on the observational constraints related to HBB
nucleosynthesis, such as globular cluster chemical anomalies.",2007-03-05T14:36:46Z
"Roundoff-induced attractors and reversibility in conservative
  two-dimensional maps","We numerically study two conservative two-dimensional maps, namely the baker
map (whose Lyapunov exponent is known to be positive), and a typical one
(exhibiting a vanishing Lyapunov exponent) chosen from the generalized shift
family of maps introduced by C. Moore [Phys Rev Lett {\bf 64}, 2354 (1990)] in
the context of undecidability. We calculated the time evolution of the entropy
$S_q \equiv \frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^Wp_i^q}{q-1}$ ($S_1=S_{BG}\equiv
-\sum_{i=1}^Wp_i \ln p_i$), and exhibited the dramatic effect introduced by
numerical precision. Indeed, in spite of being area-preserving maps, they
present, {\it well after} the initially concentrated ensemble has spread
virtually all over the phase space, unexpected {\it pseudo-attractors}
(fixed-point like for the baker map, and more complex structures for the Moore
map). These pseudo-attractors, and the apparent time (partial) reversibility
they provoke, gradually disappear for increasingly large precision. In the case
of the Moore map, they are related to zero Lebesgue-measure effects associated
with the frontiers existing in the definition of the map. In addition to the
above, and consistently with the results by V. Latora and M. Baranger [Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 82}, 520 (1999)], we find that the rate of the
far-from-equilibrium entropy production of baker map, numerically coincides
with the standard Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of this strongly chaotic system.",2007-02-23T20:40:42Z
Centipede ladder at quarter filling,"We study the ground state and excitation spectrum of a quasi one-dimensional
nanostructure consisting of a pole and rungs oriented in the opposite
directions (""centipede ladder"", CL) at quarter filling. The spin and charge
excitation spectra are found in the limits of small and large longitudinal
hopping $t_\|$ compared to the on-rung hopping rate $t_\perp$ and exchange
coupling $I_\perp$. At small $t_\|$ the system with ferromagnetic on-rung
exchange demonstrates instability against dimerization. Coherent propagation of
charge transfer excitons is possible in this limit. At large $t_\|$ CL behaves
like two-orbital Hubbard chain, but the gap opens in the charge excitation
spectrum thus reducing the symmetry from SU(4) to SU(2). The spin excitations
are always gapless and their dispersion changes from quadratic magnon-like for
ferromagnetic on-rung exchange to linear spinon-like for antiferromagnetic
on-rung exchange in weak longitudinal hopping limit.",2007-02-13T15:21:12Z
Graph Partitioning Induced Phase Transitions,"We study the percolation properties of graph partitioning on random regular
graphs with N vertices of degree $k$. Optimal graph partitioning is directly
related to optimal attack and immunization of complex networks. We find that
for any partitioning process (even if non-optimal) that partitions the graph
into equal sized connected components (clusters), the system undergoes a
percolation phase transition at $f=f_c=1-2/k$ where $f$ is the fraction of
edges removed to partition the graph. For optimal partitioning, at the
percolation threshold, we find $S \sim N^{0.4}$ where $S$ is the size of the
clusters and $\ell\sim N^{0.25}$ where $\ell$ is their diameter. Additionally,
we find that $S$ undergoes multiple non-percolation transitions for $f<f_c$.",2007-02-17T23:28:56Z
Noise Limited Computational Speed,"In modern transistor based logic gates, the impact of noise on computation
has become increasingly relevant since the voltage scaling strategy, aimed at
decreasing the dissipated power, has increased the probability of error due to
the reduced switching threshold voltages. In this paper we discuss the role of
noise in a two state model that mimic the dynamics of standard logic gates and
show that the presence of the noise sets a fundamental limit to the computing
speed. An optimal idle time interval that minimizes the error probability, is
derived.",2007-02-11T09:52:12Z
Effective mass anomalies in strained Si thin films and crystals,"Effective mass anomalies due to the geometrical effects are investigated in
silicon nanostructures using first-principles calculations for the first time.
In \{111\} and \{110\} biaxially strained Si, it is found that longitudinal
effective mass is extraordinarily enhanced for both thin films and crystals.
This mass enhancement is caused by the change of the band structure with double
minima into that with a single minimum due to strain and confinement. At the
transition point, it is analytically shown that the effective mass diverges.
The dependences of the confinement thickness on the anomalies are qualitatively
explained by an extension of the effective mass approximation.",2007-01-16T12:09:10Z
"Hartree-Fock variational bounds for ground state energy of chargeless
  fermions with finite magnetic moment in presence of a hard core potential:A
  stable ferromagnetic state","We use different types of determinantal Hartree-Fock (HF) wave functions to
calculate variational bounds for the ground state energy of spin-half fermions
in volume V_0, with mass m, electric charge zero, and magnetic moment mu, which
are interacting through long range magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. We find
that at high densities when the average inter particle distance r_0 becomes
small compared to the magnetic length r_m, a ferromagnetic state with
spheroidal occupation function, involving quadrupolar deformation, gives a
lower energy compared to the variational energy for the uniform paramagnetic
state. This HF variational bound to the ground state energy turns out to have a
lower energy than our earlier calculation in which instead of a determinantal
wavefunction we had used a positive semi-definite single particle density
matrix operator whose eigenvalues, having quadrupolar deformation, were allowed
to take any value from 0 to 1. This system is of course still unstable towards
infinite density collapse, but we show here explicitly that a suitable short
range repulsive (hard core) interaction of strength U_0 and range a can stop
this collapse.The existence of a stable high density ferromagnetic state with
spheroidal occupation function is possible as long as the ratio of hard-core
and magnetic dipole coupling constants is not very small compared to 1.",2007-03-21T13:04:27Z
"The Stryngbohtyk Model of the Universe: a Solution to the Problem of the
  Cosmological Constant","Astronomical observations have shown that the expansion of the universe is at
present accelerating, in a way consistent with the presence of a positive
cosmological constant. This is a major puzzle, because we do not understand:
why the cosmological constant is so small; why, being so small, it is not
exactly zero; and why it has precisely the value it must have to make the
expansion start accelerating just at the epoch when we are observing the
universe. We present a new model of cosmology, which we call the stryngbohtyk
model, that solves all these problems and predicts exactly the value that the
cosmological constant must have. The predicted value agrees with the observed
one within the measurement error. We show that in the stryngbohtyk model, the
fact the cosmological constant starts being important at the present epoch is
not a coincidence at all, but a necessity implied by our origin in a planet
orbiting a star that formed when the age of the universe was of the same order
as the lifetime of the star.",2007-03-30T08:29:21Z
Inhomogeneity-induced enhancement of the pairing interaction in cuprates,"Scanning tunneling spectroscopy has recently discovered a positive
correlation between the magnitude of the superconducting gap and positions of
dopant oxygen atoms in Bi-based cuprates. We propose a microscopic mechanism
that could be responsible for this effect. In particular, we demonstrate that
the dopant-induced spatial variation of the atomic levels always enhances the
superexchange interaction.",2007-03-22T00:35:38Z
"Very high contrast IFU spectroscopy of AB Doradus C: 9 mag contrast at
  0.2"" without a coronagraph using spectral deconvolution","We present an extension of the spectral deconvolution method (Sparks & Ford
2002) to achieve very high contrast at small inner working radii. We apply the
method to the specific case of ground based adaptive optics fed integral field
spectroscopy (without a coronagraph). Utilising the wavelength dependence of
the Airy and speckle patterns, we make an accurate estimate of the PSF that can
be scaled and subtracted from the data cube. The residual noise in the
resulting spectra is very close to the photon noise from the starlight halo. We
utilise the technique to extract a very high SNR H & K band spectrum of AB Dor
C, the low mass companion to AB Dor A. By effectively eliminating all
contamination from AB Dor A, the extracted spectrum retains both continuum and
spectral features. The achieved 1 sigma contrast is 9 mag at 0.2"", 11 mag at
0.5"", in 20 mins exposure time, at an effective spectral bandwidth of 5.5 nm,
proving that the method is applicable even in low Strehl regimes.
  The spectral deconvolution method clearly demonstrates the efficacy of image
slicer based IFUs in achieving very high contrast imaging spectroscopy at small
angular separations, validating their use as high contrast
spectrographs/imagers for extreme adaptive optics systems.",2007-03-21T17:19:48Z
Size-dependent melting of spherical copper nanoparticles,"We report size-dependent melting of spherical copper nanoparticles embedded
into silica matrix. Based on the temperature dependence of the surface plasmon
resonance energy and its width we observe two distinct melting regimes. For
particles smaller than 20 nm the absorption spectrum changes monotonically with
the temperature, and this allows us to assume the gradual solid-liquid phase
transition (melting) of the nanoparticles or existence of superheated solid
nanoparticles. In contrast, for nanoparticles larger than 20 nm, we observe a
jump-like increase of the bandwidth and non-monotonic dependence of surface
plasmon energy at the temperatures below the bulk melting point. This indicates
that the melting of large nanoparticles is a first-order phase transition
similar to the melting of bulk copper.",2007-01-12T13:50:30Z
"Algebraic Signal Processing Theory: Cooley-Tukey Type Algorithms for
  DCTs and DSTs","This paper presents a systematic methodology based on the algebraic theory of
signal processing to classify and derive fast algorithms for linear transforms.
Instead of manipulating the entries of transform matrices, our approach derives
the algorithms by stepwise decomposition of the associated signal models, or
polynomial algebras. This decomposition is based on two generic methods or
algebraic principles that generalize the well-known Cooley-Tukey FFT and make
the algorithms' derivations concise and transparent. Application to the 16
discrete cosine and sine transforms yields a large class of fast algorithms,
many of which have not been found before.",2007-02-04T23:44:34Z
"Simulations on the elastic response of amorphous and nanocomposite
  carbon","Theoretical calculations of the elastic response of carbon composites and
amorphous carbon are reported. The studied composites consist of crystalline
nanoinclusions, either spherical diamonds or carbon nanotubes, embedded in
amorphous carbon matrices. The elastic constants of the composites were
calculated and found to systematically increase as the density increases. The
elastic recovery under hydrostatic pressure for all structures was also
investigated and was found to be significantly high for both nanocomposite and
amorphous carbon, but decreases as the material becomes more dilute.",2007-03-02T23:36:21Z
Dirac fermions in de Sitter and anti-de Sitter backgrounds,"Starting with a new theory of symmetries generated by isometries in field
theories with spin, one finds the generators of the spinor representation in
backgrounds with a given symmetry. In this manner one obtains a collection of
conserved operators from which one can chose the complete sets of commuting
operators defining quantum modes. In this framework, the quantum modes of the
free Dirac field on de Sitter or anti-de Sitter spacetimes can be completely
derived in static or moving charts. One presents the discrete quantum modes, in
the central static charts of the anti-de Sitter spacetime, whose eigenspinors
can be normalized. The consequence is that the second quantization can be done
in this case in canonical manner. For the free Dirac field on de Sitter
manifolds this can not be done in static charts being forced to consider the
moving ones. The quantum modes of the free Dirac field in these charts are used
for writing down the quantum Dirac field and its one-particle operators.",2007-01-22T11:44:35Z
"Brownian motion of black holes in stellar systems with non-Maxwellian
  distribution for the stars field","A massive black hole at the center of a dense stellar system, such as a
globular cluster or a galactic nucleus, is subject to a random walk due
gravitational encounters with nearby stars. It behaves as a Brownian particle,
since it is much more massive than the surrounding stars and moves much more
slowly than they do. If the distribution function for the stellar velocities is
Maxwellian, there is a exact equipartition of kinetic energy between the black
hole and the stars in the stationary state. However, if the distribution
function deviates from a Maxwellian form, the strict equipartition cannot be
achieved. The deviation from equipartition is quantified in this work by
applying the Tsallis q-distribution for the stellar velocities in a
q-isothermal stellar system and in a generalized King model.",2007-03-14T17:07:28Z
"Analysis of a SU(4) generalization of Halperin's wave function as an
  approach towards a SU(4) fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene sheets","Inspired by the four-fold spin-valley symmetry of relativistic electrons in
graphene, we investigate a possible SU(4) fractional quantum Hall effect, which
may also arise in bilayer semiconductor quantum Hall systems with small Zeeman
gap. SU(4) generalizations of Halperin's wave functions [Helv. Phys. Acta 56,

studied analytically and compared, at nu=2/3, to exact-diagonalization studies.",2007-01-26T16:40:19Z
Entropy and anisotropy,"We address the problem of defining the concept of entropy for anisotropic

construction of entropy and show that it cannot be associated with the one
following from relativistic thermodynamics.",2007-01-23T01:00:26Z
Invariance of the Kohn (sloshing) mode in a conserving theory,"It is proven that the center of mass (COM or Kohn) oscillation of a many-body
system in a harmonic trap coincides with the motion of a single particle as
long as conserving approximations are applied to treat the interactions. The
two conditions formulated by Kadanoff and Baym \cite{kb-book} are shown to be
sufficient to preserve the COM mode. The result equally applies to zero and
finite temperature, as well as to nonequilibrium situations, and to the linear
and nonlinear response regimes.",2007-02-27T09:38:32Z
Theoretical X-Ray Absorption Debye-Waller Factors,"An approach is presented for theoretical calculations of the Debye-Waller
factors in x-ray absorption spectra. These factors are represented in terms of
the cumulant expansion up to third order. They account respectively for the net
thermal expansion $\sigma^{(1)}(T)$, the mean-square relative displacements
$\sigma^2(T)$, and the asymmetry of the pair distribution function
$\sigma^{(3)}(T)$. Similarly, we obtain Debye-Waller factors for x-ray and
neutron scattering in terms of the mean-square vibrational amplitudes $u^2(T)$.
Our method is based on density functional theory calculations of the dynamical
matrix, together with an efficient Lanczos algorithm for projected phonon
spectra within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Due to anharmonicity in the
interatomic forces, the results are highly sensitive to variations in the
equilibrium lattice constants, and hence to the choice of exchange-correlation
potential. In order to treat this sensitivity, we introduce two prescriptions:
one based on the local density approximation, and a second based on a modified
generalized gradient approximation. Illustrative results for the leading
cumulants are presented for several materials and compared with experiment and
with correlated Einstein and Debye models. We also obtain Born-von Karman
parameters and corrections due to perpendicular vibrations.",2007-02-16T19:08:04Z
"Ab initio study of charge transport through single oxygen molecules in
  atomic aluminum contacts","We present ab initio calculations of transport properties of atomic-sized
aluminum contacts in the presence of oxygen. The experimental situation is
modeled by considering a single oxygen atom (O) or one of the molecules O2 and
O3 bridging the gap between electrodes forming ideal, atomically sharp
pyramids. The transport characteristics are computed for these geometries with
increasing distances between the leads, simulating the opening of a break
junction. To facilitate comparison with experiments further, the vibrational
modes of the oxygen connected to the electrodes are studied. It is found that
in the contact regime the change of transport properties due to the presence of
oxygen is strong and should be detectable in experiments. All three types of
oxygen exhibit a comparable behavior in their vibrational frequencies and
conductances, which are well below the conductance of pure aluminum atomic
contacts. The conductance decreases for an increasing number of oxygen atoms.
In the tunneling regime the conductance decays exponentially with distance and
the decay length depends on whether or not oxygen is present in the junction.
This fact may provide a way to identify the presence of a gas molecule in
metallic atomic contacts.",2007-02-20T21:28:55Z
"Tunnelling couplings in discrete lattices, single particle band
  structure and eigenstates of interacting atom pairs","By adjusting the tunnelling couplings over longer than nearest neighbor
distances it is possible in discrete lattice models to reproduce the properties
of the lowest energy band of a real, continuous periodic potential. We propose
to include such terms in problems with interacting particles and we show that
they have significant consequences for scattering and bound states of atom
pairs in periodic potentials.",2007-03-22T09:17:36Z
Feasible Depth,"This paper introduces two complexity-theoretic formulations of Bennett's
logical depth: finite-state depth and polynomial-time depth. It is shown that
for both formulations, trivial and random infinite sequences are shallow, and a
slow growth law holds, implying that deep sequences cannot be created easily
from shallow sequences. Furthermore, the E analogue of the halting language is
shown to be polynomial-time deep, by proving a more general result: every
language to which a nonnegligible subset of E can be reduced in uniform
exponential time is polynomial-time deep.",2007-01-19T22:10:50Z
"Pre-main-sequence stars in the young open cluster NGC 1893: II. Evidence
  for triggered massive star formation","(Abridged) The open cluster NGC 1893, illuminating the HII region IC410,
contains a moderately large population of O-type stars and is one of the
youngest clusters observable in the optical range. We have probed the stellar
population of NGC 1893 in an attempt to determine its size and extent. We
classify a large sample of cluster members with new intermediate resolution
spectroscopy. We use H-alpha slitless spectroscopy of the field to search for
emission line objects, identifying 18 emission-line PMS stars. We then combine
existing optical photometry with 2MASS JHKs photometry to detect stars with
infrared excesses, finding close to 20 more PMS candidates. While almost all
stars earlier than B2 indicate standard reddening, all later cluster members
show strong deviations from a standard reddening law, which we interpret in
terms of infrared excess emission. Emission-line stars and IR-excess objects
show the same spatial distribution, concentrating around two localised areas,
the immediate vicinity of the pennant nebulae Sim 129 and Sim 130 and the area
close to the cluster core where the rim of the molecular cloud associated with
IC 410 is illuminated by the nearby O-type stars. In and around the emission
nebula Sim 130 we find three Herbig Be stars with spectral types in the B1-4
range and several other fainter emission-line stars. We obtain a complete
census of B-type stars by combining Stroemgren, Johnson and 2MASS photometry
and find a deficit of intermediate mass stars compared to massive stars. We
observe a relatively extended halo of massive stars surrounding the cluster
without an accompanying population of intermediate-mass stars. The overall
picture of star formation in NGC 1893 suggests a very complex process.",2007-03-28T08:28:49Z
Hamiltonian Formulation of 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein Theory,"We analyze the consistency of the ADM approach to KK model; we prove that KK
reduction commute with ADM splitting. This leads to a well defined Hamiltonian;
we provide the outcome. The electromagnetic constraint is derived from a
geometrical one and this result enforces the physical meaning of KK model.
Moreover we study the role of the extra scalar field we have in our model;
classical hints from geodesic motion and cosmological solutions suggest that
the scalar field can be an alternative time variable in the relational point of
view.",2007-02-01T15:36:14Z
"Thermodynamic formalism and large deviation functions in continuous time
  Markov dynamics","The thermodynamic formalism, which was first developed for dynamical systems
and then applied to discrete Markov processes, turns out to be well suited for
continuous time Markov processes as well, provided the definitions are
interpreted in an appropriate way. Besides, it can be reformulated in terms of
the generating function of an observable, and then extended to other
observables. In particular, the simple observable $K$ giving the number of
events occurring over a given time interval turns out to contain already the
signature of dynamical phase transitions. For mean-field models in equilibrium,
and in the limit of large systems, the formalism is rather simple to apply and
shows how thermodynamic phase transitions may modify the dynamical properties
of the systems. This is exemplified with the q-state mean-field Potts model,
for which the Ising limit q=2 is found to be qualitatively different from the
other cases.",2007-03-16T15:31:01Z
Properties of Mesoscopic Hybrid Superconducting Systems,"In this paper we review several aspects of mesoscopic hybrid superconducting
systems. In particular we consider charge and heat transport properties in
hybrid superconducting-metal structures and the effect of charging energy in
superconducting nanostructures.",2007-03-30T08:56:02Z
Infrared Extinction Toward Nearby Star-Forming Regions,"We present an independent estimate of the interstellar extinction law for the
Spitzer IRAC bands as well as a first attempt at extending the law to the
24micron MIPS band. The source data for these measurements are observations of
five nearby star-forming regions: the Orion A cloud, NGC 2068/71, NGC 2024/23,
Serpens and Ophiuchus. Color excess ratios E(H-Ks)/E(Ks-[lambda]) were measured
for stars without infrared excess dust emission from circumstellar
disks/envelopes.
  For four of these five regions, the extinction laws are similar at all
wavelengths and differ systematically from a previous determination of the
extinction law, which was dominated by the diffuse ISM, derived for the IRAC
bands. This difference could be due to the difference in the dust properties of
the dense molecular clouds observed here and those of the diffuse ISM. The
extinction law at longer wavelengths toward the Ophiuchus region lies between
that to the other four regions studied here and that for the ISM. In addition,
we extended our extinction law determination to 24micron for Serpens and NGC
2068/71 using Spitzer MIPS data. We compare these results against several ISO
extinction law determinations, although in each case there are assumptions
which make absolute comparison uncertain. However, our work confirms a
relatively flatter extinction curve from 4 - 8micron than the previously
assumed standard, as noted by all of these recent studies. The extinction law
at 24micron is consistent with previous measurements and models, although there
are relatively large uncertainties.",2007-03-29T21:51:41Z
Hidden symmetries in Bechgaard salt (TMTSF)2NO3,"Among known Bechgaard and Fabre salts (TMTSF)2NO3 is unique since it never
becomes superconducting even under pressure. Also, though (TMTSF)2NO3 undergoes
the spin density wave (SDW) transition, the low temperature transport is
semimetallic and gapless. We propose: a) the absence of the superconductivity
is due to the inverse symmetry breaking associated with the anion ordering at
45K; b) the SDW state below 9K should be unconventional as seen from the angle
dependent magnetoresistance oscillation (AMRO); c) a new phase diagram for
Bechgaard salts, where unconventional spin density wave (USDW) occupies the
prominent space.",2007-02-05T10:27:15Z
"Non-Singular Spherically Symmetric Solution in Einstein-Scalar-Tensor
  Gravity","A static spherically symmetric metric in Einstein-scalar-tensor gravity
theory with a scalar field potential $V[\phi]$ is non-singular for all real
values of the coordinates. It does not have a black hole event horizon and
there is no essential singularity at the origin of coordinates. The weak energy
condition $\rho_\phi > 0$ fails to be satisfied for $r\lesssim 1.3r_S$ (where
$r_S$ is the Schwarzschild radius) but the strong energy condition
$\rho_\phi+3p_\phi > 0$ is satisfied. The classical Einstein-scalar-tensor
solution is regular everywhere in spacetime without a black hole event horizon.
However, the violation of the weak energy condition may signal the need for
quantum physics anti-gravity as $r\to 0$. The non-singular static spherically
symmetric solution is stable against the addition of ordinary matter.",2007-02-13T15:37:30Z
"Frequency combinations in the magnetoresistance oscillations spectrum of
  a linear chain of coupled orbits with a high scattering rate","The oscillatory magnetoresistance spectrum of the organic metal
(BEDO)$_5$Ni(CN)$_4\cdot$3C$_2$H$_4$(OH)$_2$ has been studied up to 50 T, in
the temperature range from 1.5 K to 4.2 K. In high magnetic field, its Fermi
surface corresponds to a linear chain of quasi-two-dimensional orbits coupled
by magnetic breakdown (MB). The scattering rate consistently deduced from the
data relevant to the basic $\alpha$ and the MB-induced $\beta$ orbits is very
large which points to a significant reduction of the chemical potential
oscillation. Despite of this feature, the oscillations spectrum exhibits many
frequency combinations. Their effective masses and (or) Dingle temperature are
not in agreement with either the predictions of the quantum interference model
or the semiclassical model of Falicov and Stachowiak.",2007-03-09T16:47:00Z
On the existence of stationary states during granular compaction,"When submitted to gentle mechanical taps a granular packing slowly compacts
until it reaches a stationary state that depends on the tap characteristics.
The properties of such stationary states are experimentally investigated. The
influence of the initial state, taps properties and tapping protocol are
studied. The compactivity of the packings is determinated. Our results strongly
support the idea that the stationary states are genuine thermodynamic states.",2007-01-31T10:00:39Z
Broad Band Optical Polarimetric Study of IC 1805,"We present the BVR broad band polarimetric observations of 51 stars belonging
to the young open cluster IC 1805. Along with the photometric data from the
literature we have modeled and subtracted the foreground dust contribution from
the maximum polarization (P_{max}) and colour excess (E_{B-V}). The mean value
of the P_max for intracluster medium and the foreground are found to be 5.008
+/-0.005 % and 4.865 +/-0.022 % respectively. Moreover, the mean value of the
wavelength of maximum polarization (lambda_{max}) for intracluster medium is
0.541 +/- 0.003 micro m, which is quite similar as the general interstellar
medium (ISM). The resulting intracluster dust component is found to have
negligible polarization efficiency as compared to interstellar dust. Some of
the observed stars in IC 1805 have shown the indication of intrinsic
polarization in their measurements.",2007-03-22T10:23:07Z
"First Passage Time for Multivariate Jump-diffusion Stochastic Models
  With Applications in Finance","The ``first passage-time'' (FPT) problem is an important problem with a wide
range of applications in mathematics, physics, biology and finance.
Mathematically, such a problem can be reduced to estimating the probability of
a (stochastic) process first to reach a critical level or threshold. While in
other areas of applications the FPT problem can often be solved analytically,
in finance we usually have to resort to the application of numerical
procedures, in particular when we deal with jump-diffusion stochastic processes
(JDP). In this paper, we develop a Monte-Carlo-based methodology for the
solution of the FPT problem in the context of a multivariate jump-diffusion
stochastic process. The developed methodology is tested by using different
parameters, the simulation results indicate that the developed methodology is
much more efficient than the conventional Monte Carlo method. It is an
efficient tool for further practical applications, such as the analysis of
default correlation and predicting barrier options in finance.",2007-02-28T10:39:15Z
Dynamic Glass Transition in Two Dimensions,"The question about the existence of a structural glass transition in two
dimensions is studied using mode coupling theory (MCT). We determine the
explicit d-dependence of the memory functional of mode coupling for
one-component systems. Applied to two dimensions we solve the MCT equations
numerically for monodisperse hard discs. A dynamic glass transition is found at
a critical packing fraction phi_c^{d=2} = 0.697 which is above phi_c^{d=3} =
0.516 by about 35%. phi^d_c scales approximately with phi^d_{\rm rcp} the value
for random close packing, at least for d=2, 3. Quantities characterizing the
local, cooperative 'cage motion' do not differ much for d=2 and d=3, and we
e.g. find the Lindemann criterion for the localization length at the glass
transition. The final relaxation obeys the superposition principle, collapsing
remarkably well onto a Kohlrausch law. The d=2 MCT results are in qualitative
agreement with existing results from MC and MD simulations. The mean squared
displacements measured experimentally for a quasi-two-dimensional binary system
of dipolar hard spheres can be described satisfactorily by MCT for monodisperse
hard discs over four decades in time provided the experimental control
parameter Gamma (which measures the strength of dipolar interactions) and the
packing fraction phi are properly related to each other.",2007-03-07T08:24:43Z
"Anomalous Dynamics of Unbiased Polymer Translocation through a Narrow
  Pore","We consider a polymer of length $N$ translocating through a narrow pore in
the absence of external fields. Characterization of its purportedly anomalous
dynamics has so far remained incomplete. We show that the polymer dynamics is
anomalous until the Rouse time $\tau_{R}\sim N^{1+2\nu}$, with a mean square
displacement through the pore consistent with $t^{(1+\nu)/(1+2\nu)}$, with
$\nu\approx0.588$ the Flory exponent. This is shown to be directly related to a
decay in time of the excess monomer density near the pore as
$t^{-(1+\nu)/(1+2\nu)}\exp(-t/\tau_{R})$. Beyond the Rouse time translocation
becomes diffusive. In consequence of this, the dwell-time $\tau_{d}$, the time
a translocating polymer typically spends within the pore, scales as
$N^{2+\nu}$, in contrast to previous claims.",2007-03-15T10:35:24Z
"Lateral diffusion of receptor-ligand bonds in membrane adhesion zones:
  Effect of thermal membrane roughness","The adhesion of cells is mediated by membrane receptors that bind to
complementary ligands in apposing cell membranes. It is generally assumed that
the lateral diffusion of mobile receptor-ligand bonds in membrane-membrane
adhesion zones is slower than the diffusion of unbound receptors and ligands.
We find that this slowing down is not only caused by the larger size of the
bound receptor-ligand complexes, but also by thermal fluctuations of the
membrane shape. We model two adhering membranes as elastic sheets pinned
together by receptor-ligand bonds and study the diffusion of the bonds using
Monte Carlo simulations. In our model, the fluctuations reduce the bond
diffusion constant in planar membranes by a factor close to 2 in the
biologically relevant regime of small bond concentrations.",2007-03-19T17:24:34Z
"Nanometer scale electronic reconstruction at the interface between LaVO3
  and LaVO4","Electrons at interfaces, driven to minimize their free energy, are
distributed differently than in bulk. This can be dramatic at interfaces
involving heterovalent compounds. Here we profile an abrupt interface between V
3d2 LaVO3 and V 3d0 LaVO4 using electron energy loss spectroscopy. Although no
bulk phase of LaVOx with a V 3d1 configuration exists, we find a nanometer-wide
region of V 3d1 at the LaVO3/LaVO4 interface, rather than a mixture of V 3d0
and V 3d2. The two-dimensional sheet of 3d1 electrons is a prototypical
electronic reconstruction at an interface between competing ground states.",2007-01-04T17:42:38Z
The New Class of Dusty DAZ White Dwarfs,"Our mid-infrared survey of 124 white dwarfs with the Spitzer Space Telescope
and the IRAC imager has revealed an infrared excess associated with the white
dwarf WD 2115-560 naturally explained by circumstellar dust. This object is the
fourth white dwarf observed to have circumstellar dust. All four are DAZ white
dwarfs, i.e. they have both photospheric Balmer lines and photospheric metal
lines.
  We discuss these four objects as a class, which we abbreviate ""DAZd"", where
the ""d"" stands for ""dust"". Using an optically-thick, geometrically-thin disk
model analogous to Saturn's rings, we find that the inner disk edges are at
>~0.1 to 0.2 Ro and that the outer disk edges are ~0.3 to 0.6 Ro. This model
naturally explains the accretion rates and lifetimes of the detected WD disks
and the accretion rates inferred from photospheric metal abundances.",2007-03-18T02:07:27Z
Dispersion anomalies induced by the low-energy plasmon in the cuprates,"We discuss the characteristic effects of the electron plasmon interaction
resulting from the ~ 1 eV plasmon, which is a universal feature in the
cuprates. Using the framework of a one-band tight binding model, we identify
signatures of this low energy plasmon in the electronic structure of metallic
overdoped Bi2212 as well as half-filled insulating SCOC. The electron-plasmon
interaction is found to yield renormalizations near the Fermi energy in
reasonable accord with experimental observations, and to produce dispersion
anomalies at higher energies.",2007-01-18T23:16:18Z
"Signatures of the extragalactic cosmic-ray source composition from
  spectrum and shower depth measurements","We discuss the differences induced by the assumed composition of
extragalactic sources on the predicted UHECR spectrum and the energy evolution
of $<X_{\max}>$, i.e. the mean value of the atmospheric depth at the cosmic-ray
air shower maximum. We show that different assumptions for the source power
evolution do not modify our earlier finding that in the case of a mixed
composition the ankle can be interpreted as the end of the transition from
galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays. We show the characteristic features in
the shape of $<X_{\max}>$(E) that are associated with this transition for each
cosmic-ray composition model. These characteristic features are present
whatever the hadronic model used for the calculation. In the mixed composition
cases, a signature of the interactions of nuclei with the photon backgrounds is
also expected above $10^{19}$ eV. The comparisons with Stereo HiRes and Fly's
Eye data favour an extragalactic mixed composition and the corresponding
interpretation of the ankle. Confrontation of model predictions with future
data at the highest energies will allow a better determination of the
transition features and of the cosmic-ray source composition, independently of
hadronic models. We also emphasize that in the pure proton case, a combined
analysis of the spectrum and composition below the ankle could lead to
constraints on the source power evolution with redshift.",2007-03-24T23:45:20Z
"Analytical approach to directed sandpile models on the Apollonian
  network","We investigate a set of directed sandpile models on the Apollonian network,
which are inspired on the work by Dhar and Ramaswamy (PRL \textbf{63}, 1659
(1989)) for Euclidian lattices. They are characterized by a single parameter
$q$, that restricts the number of neighbors receiving grains from a toppling
node. Due to the geometry of the network, two and three point correlation
functions are amenable to exact treatment, leading to analytical results for
the avalanche distributions in the limit of an infinite system, for $q=1,2$.
The exact recurrence expressions for the correlation functions are numerically
iterated to obtain results for finite size systems, when larger values of $q$
are considered. Finally, a detailed description of the local flux properties is
provided by a multifractal scaling analysis.",2007-01-29T19:04:59Z
Chiral tilt texture domains in two dimensions,"We study the shape and texture of finite domains comprising chiral/achiral
molecules carrying a tilt field embedded in a 2-dimensional surface. Using a
combination of simulations and {\it exact} variational calculations, we
determine the equilibrium (mean field) phase diagram in the achiral and chiral
cases. We find a variety of novel shapes and textures including a {\it
spontaneously broken chiral texture} when the molecules are achiral. We show
that chiral tilt-domains nucleating in a region of two-phase coexistence, {\it
repel} each other, thereby preventing coalescence and further growth. Our work
has implications for tilt texture domains in phospholipid monolayers and giant
unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), nucleating domains of Sm-C$^*$ in Sm-A films, and
chiral emulsions in Sm-A films.",2007-03-07T10:34:27Z
The nonlinear fragmentation equation,"We study the kinetics of nonlinear irreversible fragmentation. Here
fragmentation is induced by interactions/collisions between pairs of particles,
and modelled by general classes of interaction kernels, and for several types
of breakage models. We construct initial value and scaling solutions of the
fragmentation equations, and apply the ""non-vanishing mass flux ""criterion for
the occurrence of shattering transitions. These properties enable us to
determine the phase diagram for the occurrence of shattering states and of
scaling states in the phase space of model parameters.",2007-03-22T08:57:18Z
Kinetics of the long-range spherical model,"The kinetic spherical model with long-range interactions is studied after a
quench to $T < T_c$ or to $T = T_c$. For the two-time response and correlation
functions of the order-parameter as well as for composite fields such as the
energy density, the ageing exponents and the corresponding scaling functions
are derived. The results are compared to the predictions which follow from
local scale-invariance.",2007-03-16T17:39:04Z
Theory of Polaron Resonance in Quantum Dots and Quantum-Dot Molecules,"The theory of exciton coupling to photons and LO phonons in quantum dots
(QDs) and quantum-dot molecules (QDMs) is presented. Resonant-round trips of
the exciton between the ground (bright) and excited (dark or bright) states
mediated by the LO-phonon alter the decay time and yield the Rabi oscillation.
The initial distributions of the population in the ground and the excited
states dominate the oscillating amplitude and frequency. This property provides
a detectable signature to the information stored in a qubit made from QD or QDM
for a wide range of temperature T. Our results presented herein provide an
explanation to the anomaly on T-dependent decay in self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs
QDMs recently reported by experiment.",2007-03-15T07:38:58Z
Stability of longitudinal coupling for Josephson charge qubits,"For inductively coupled superconducting quantum bits, we determine the
conditions when the coupling commutes with the single-qubit terms. We show that
in certain parameter regimes such longitudinal coupling can be stabilized with
respect to variations of the circuit parameters. In addition, we analyze its
stability against fluctuations of the control fields.",2007-01-20T20:35:04Z
Valence-band mixing in first-principles envelope-function theory,"This paper presents a numerical implementation of a first-principles
envelope-function theory derived recently by the author [B. A. Foreman, Phys.
Rev. B 72, 165345 (2005)]. The examples studied deal with the valence subband
structure of GaAs/AlAs, GaAs/Al(0.2)Ga(0.8)As, and In(0.53)Ga(0.47)As/InP (001)
superlattices calculated using the local density approximation to
density-functional theory and norm-conserving pseudopotentials without
spin-orbit coupling. The heterostructure Hamiltonian is approximated using
quadratic response theory, with the heterostructure treated as a perturbation
of a bulk reference crystal. The valence subband structure is reproduced
accurately over a wide energy range by a multiband envelope-function
Hamiltonian with linear renormalization of the momentum and mass parameters.
Good results are also obtained over a more limited energy range from a
single-band model with quadratic renormalization. The effective kinetic-energy
operator ordering derived here is more complicated than in many previous
studies, consisting in general of a linear combination of all possible operator
orderings. In some cases the valence-band Rashba coupling differs significantly
from the bulk magnetic Luttinger parameter. The splitting of the
quasidegenerate ground state of no-common-atom superlattices has non-negligible
contributions from both short-range interface mixing and long-range dipole
terms in the quadratic density response.",2007-01-17T02:38:33Z
"Signatures of Many-Particle Correlations in Two-Dimensional
  Fourier-Transform Spectra of Semiconductor Nanostructures","On the basis of a microscopic theory, the signatures of many-particle
correlations in Two-Dimensional Fourier-Transform Spectra (2D-FTS) of
semiconductor nanostructures are identified and compared to experimental data.
Spectra in the photon energy range of the heavy-hole and light-hole excitonic
resonances show characteristic features due to correlations, which depend on
the relative polarization directions of the excitation pulses.",2007-02-05T15:19:23Z
"Physical conditions in the neutral interstellar medium at z=2.43 toward
  Q2348-011","We obtained a high-resolution VLT-UVES spectrum of the quasar Q2348-011 over
a wavelength range that covers most of the prominent metal and molecular
absorption lines from the log N(HI)=20.50+-0.10 damped Lyman-alpha system at
zabs=2.43. From the column density ratios and the relative populations of H2
rotational and CI fine-structure levels, we derive the physical conditions
(relative abundances, dust-depletion, particle density, kinetic temperature and
ionizing flux) and discuss physical conditions in the neutral phase. Molecular
hydrogen is detected in seven components in the first four rotational levels (J
= 0-3) of the vibrational ground state. Absorption lines of H2 J = 4 (resp. J =
5) are also detected in six (resp. two) of these components. This leads to a
total molecular fraction of log f = -1.69+0.37-0.58. We confirm the earlier
findings that there is a correlation between N(FeII)/N(SII) and N(SiII)/N(SII)
indicative of a dust-depletion pattern. Surprisingly, however, the depletion of
metals onto dust in the H2 components is not large in this system: [Fe/S] =
-0.8 to -0.1. The gas in H2-bearing components is found to be cold but still
hotter than similar gas in our Galaxy (T > 130 K, instead of typically 80 K).
and dense (n=100-200 cm^-3). There is an anti-correlation between the logarithm
of the photo-absorption rate, and log N(H2)/N(CI) derived for each H2
component. We show that this is mostly due to shielding effects and implies
that the photo- absorption rate is a good indicator of the physical conditions
in the gas. We find that the gas is immersed in a intense UV field, about one
order of magnitude higher than in the solar vicinity. The results suggest that
the gas in H2-bearing DLAs is clumpy, and star-formation occurs in the
associated object.",2007-03-09T20:12:12Z
Isochronous Data Transmission With Rates Close to Channel Capacity,"The existing ARQ schemes (including a hybrid ARQ) have a throughput depending
on packet error probability. In this paper we describe a strategy for delay
tolerant applications which provide a constant throughput until the algorithm
robustness criterion is not failed. The algorithm robustness criterion is
applied to find the optimum size of the retransmission block in the assumption
of the small changes of coding rate within the rate compatible codes family.",2007-03-25T20:45:30Z
Designing arrays of Josephson junctions for specific static responses,"We consider the inverse problem of designing an array of superconducting
Josephson junctions that has a given maximum static current pattern as function
of the applied magnetic field. Such devices are used for magnetometry and as
Terahertz oscillators. The model is a 2D semilinear elliptic operator with
Neuman boundary conditions so the direct problem is difficult to solve because
of the multiplicity of solutions. For an array of small junctions in a passive
region, the model can be reduced to a 1D linear partial differential equation
with Dirac distribution sine nonlinearities. For small junctions and a
symmetric device, the maximum current is the absolute value of a cosine Fourier
series whose coefficients (resp. frequencies) are proportional to the areas
(resp. the positions) of the junctions. The inverse problem is solved by
inverse cosine Fourier transform after choosing the area of the central
junction. We show several examples using combinations of simple three junction
circuits. These new devices could then be tailored to meet specific
applications.",2007-03-12T16:26:43Z
Single-gap s-wave superconductivity in Cu$_x$TiSe$_2$,"The in-plane thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of the layered superconductor
Cu$_x$TiSe$_2$ was measured down to temperatures as low as $T_c$/40, at $x$ =
0.06 near where the CDW order vanishes. The absence of a residual linear term
at $ T \to 0$ is strong evidence for conventional s-wave superconductivity in
this system. This is further supported by the slow magnetic field dependence,
also consistent with a single gap, of uniform magnitude across the Fermi
surface. Comparison with the closely related material NbSe$_2$, where the
superconducting gap is three times larger on the Nb 4$d$ band than on the Se
4$p$ band, suggests that in Cu$_{0.06}$TiSe$_2$ the Se 4$p$ band is below the
Fermi level and the Ti 3$d$ band is alone responsible for the
superconductivity.",2007-01-26T20:28:02Z
Crystal mean field based trial wavefunctions for the FQHE ground states,"Employing the Haldane-Rezayi periodic representation, the crystalline
determinantal Hall crystal mean field solutions derived in previous works are
used to construct variational wavefunctions for the FQHE at $\nu=1/q$. The
proposed states optimize the short range correlations in a similar measure as
the Laughlin ones, since the zero of the states when the coordinates of two
particles join is of order $q$. However, the proposed wavefunctions also
incorporate the crystalline correlations of the mean field problem, through a
determinantal mean field function entering their construction. The above
properties, lead to the expectation that the considered states can be
competitive in energy per particle with the Laughlin ones. Their similar
structure also could explain way the breaking of the translation invariance in
the FQHE ground states can result to be a weak one, which after disregarded,
produce the Laughlin states as good approximations. Calculation for checking
these possibilities are under consideration.",2007-02-12T21:00:32Z
Born Again Protoplanetary Disk Around Mira B,"The Mira AB system is a nearby (~107 pc) example of a wind accreting binary
star system. In this class of system, the wind from a mass-losing red giant
star (Mira A) is accreted onto a companion (Mira B), as indicated by an
accretion shock signature in spectra at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths.
Using novel imaging techniques, we report the detection of emission at
mid-infrared wavelengths between 9.7 and 18.3 $\mu$m from the vicinity of Mira
B but with a peak at a radial position about 10 AU closer to the primary Mira
A. We interpret the mid-infrared emission as the edge of an optically-thick
accretion disk heated by Mira A. The discovery of this new class of accretion
disk fed by M-giant mass loss implies a potential population of young planetary
systems in white-dwarf binaries which has been little explored, despite being
relatively common in the solar neighborhood.",2007-03-10T21:40:30Z
"Wannier functions and exchange integrals: The example of
  LiCu$_{2}$O$_{2}$","Starting from a single band Hubbard model in the Wannier function basis, we
revisit the problem of the ligand contribution to exchange and derive explicit
formulae for the exchange integrals in metal oxide compounds in terms of atomic
parameters that can be calculated with constrained LDA and LDA+U. The analysis
is applied to the investigation of the isotropic exchange interactions of
LiCu$_{2}$O$_{2}$, a compound where the Cu-O-Cu angle of the dominant exchange
path is close to 90$^{\circ}$. Our results show that the magnetic moments are
localized in Wannier orbitals which have strong contribution from oxygen atomic
orbitals, leading to exchange integrals that considerably differ from the
estimates based on kinetic exchange only. Using LSDA+U approach, we also
perform a direct {\it ab-initio} determination of the exchange integrals
LiCu$_{2}$O$_{2}$. The results agree well with those obtained from the Wannier
function approach, a clear indication that this modelization captures the
essential physics of exchange. A comparison with experimental results is also
included, with the conclusion that a very precise determination of the Wannier
function is crucial to reach quantitative estimates.",2007-02-12T10:01:21Z
Comparisons for Esta-Task3: Cles and Cesam,"We present the results of comparing three different implementations of the
microscopic diffusion process in the stellar evolution codes CESAM and CLES.
For each of these implementations we computed models of 1.0, 1.2 and 1.3
M$_{\odot}$. We analyse the differences in their internal structure at three
selected evolutionary stages, as well as the variations of helium abundance and
depth of the stellar convective envelope. The origin of these differences and
their effects on the seismic properties of the models are also considered.",2007-03-08T17:58:26Z
"Enhanced magnetocaloric effect in frustrated magnetic molecules with
  icosahedral symmetry","We investigate the magnetocaloric properties of certain antiferromagnetic
spin systems that have already been or very likely can be synthesized as
magnetic molecules. It turns out that the special geometric frustration which
is present in antiferromagnets that consist of corner-sharing triangles leads
to an enhanced magnetocaloric effect with high cooling rates in the vicinity of
the saturation field. These findings are compared with the behavior of a simple
unfrustrated spin ring as well as with the properties of the icosahedron. To
our surprise, also for the icosahedron large cooling rates can be achieved but
due to a different kind of geometric frustration.",2007-03-19T09:21:51Z
"Thermodynamic Properties of Model Solids with Short-ranged Potentials
  from Monte Carlo Simulations and Perturbation Theory","Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to determine the excess energy
and the equation of state of fcc solids with Sutherland potentials for wide
ranges of temperatures, densities and effective potential ranges. The same
quantities have been determined within a perturbative scheme by means of two
procedures: i) Monte Carlo simulations performed on the reference hard-sphere
system and ii) second order Barker-Henderson perturbation theory. The aim was
twofold: on the one hand, to test the capability of the 'exact' MC-perturbation
theory of reproducing the direct MC simulations and, on the other hand, the
reliability of the Barker-Henderson perturbation theory, as compared with
direct MC simulations and MC-perturbation theory, to determine the
thermodynamic properties of these solids depending on temperature, density and
potential range. We have found that the simulation data for the excess energy
obtained from the two procedures are in close agreement with each other. For
the equation of state, the results from the MC-perturbation procedure also
agree well with direct MC simulations except for very low temperatures and
extremely short-ranged potentials. Regarding the Barker-Henderson perturbation
theory, we have found that, surprisingly, the first-order approximation is in
closer agreement with simulations than the second-order one.",2007-03-16T11:11:59Z
"Selection of ThAr lines for wavelength calibration of echelle spectra
  and implications for variations in the fine-structure constant","Echelle spectrographs currently provide some of the most precise and detailed
spectra in astronomy, the interpretation of which sometimes depends on the
wavelength calibration accuracy. In some applications, such as constraining
cosmological variations in the fundamental constants from quasar absorption
lines, the wavelength calibration is crucial. Here we detail an algorithm for
selecting thorium-argon (ThAr) emission lines for wavelength calibration which
incorporates the properties of both a new laboratory wavelength list and the
spectrograph of interest. We apply the algorithm to the Very Large Telescope
Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) and demonstrate a factor of
>3 improvement in the wavelength calibration residuals (i.e. random errors)
alone. It is also found that UVES spectra calibrated using a previous, widely
distributed line-list contain systematic +/-30-75 m/s distortions of the
wavelength scale over both short and long wavelength ranges. These distortions
have important implications for current UVES constraints on cosmological
variations in the fine-structure constant. The induced systematic errors are
most severe for Mg/FeII quasar absorbers in the redshift range 1.2 < z < 2.3,
with individual absorbers studied by recent authors containing systematic
errors up to 4 times larger than quoted statistical errors.",2007-03-23T20:16:32Z
"Doped Singlet-Pair Crystal in the Hubbard model on the checkerboard
  lattice","In the limit of large nearest--neighbor and on--site Coulomb repulsions, the
Hubbard model on the planar pyrochlore lattice maps, near quarter-filling, onto
a doped quantum fully packed loop model. The phase diagram exhibits at quarter
filling a novel quantum state of matter, the Resonating Singlet-Pair Crystal,
an insulating phase breaking lattice symmetry. Properties of a few doped holes
are investigated. In contrast to the doped quantum antiferromagnet, phase
separation is restricted to very small hopping leaving an extended``window''
for superconducting pairing. However the later is more fragile for large
hopping than in the case of the antiferromagnet.",2007-02-15T17:00:34Z
"Resistively shunted Josephson junctions: QFT predictions versus MC
  results","During the last fourteen years several exact results were obtained for the
so-called boundary sine-Gordon model. In the case of a conformal bulk this 2D
boundary quantum field theory describes the universal scaling behavior of the
Caldeira-Leggett model of resistively shunted Josephson junctions. In this
work, we use a recently developed Monte Carlo technique to test some of the
analytical predictions.",2007-03-27T17:57:47Z
"Phase-space and Black Hole Entropy of Higher Genus Horizons in Loop
  Quantum Gravity","In the context of loop quantum gravity, we construct the phase-space of
isolated horizons with genus greater than 0. Within the loop quantum gravity
framework, these horizons are described by genus g surfaces with N punctures
and the dimension of the corresponding phase-space is calculated including the
genus cycles as degrees of freedom. From this, the black hole entropy can be
calculated by counting the microstates which correspond to a black hole of
fixed area. We find that the leading term agrees with the A/4 law and that the
sub-leading contribution is modified by the genus cycles.",2007-02-07T00:03:42Z
"Use and Abuse of a Fractional Fokker-Planck Dynamics for Time-Dependent
  Driving","We investigate a subdiffusive, fractional Fokker-Planck dynamics occurring in
time-varying potential landscapes and thereby disclose the failure of the
fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE) in its commonly used form when
generalized in an {\it ad hoc} manner to time-dependent forces. A modified FFPE
(MFFPE) is rigorously derived, being valid for a family of dichotomously
alternating force-fields. This MFFPE is numerically validated for a rectangular
time-dependent force with zero average bias. For this case subdiffusion is
shown to become enhanced as compared to the force free case. We question,
however, the existence of any physically valid FFPE for arbitrary varying
time-dependent fields that differ from this dichotomous varying family.",2007-03-15T17:27:04Z
Pressure-Temperature Phase Diagram of Multiferroic $Ni_3V_2O_8$,"The pressure-temperature phase diagram of multiferroic $Ni_3V_2O_8$ is
investigated for hydrostatic pressures up to 2 GPa. The stability range of the
ferroelectric phase associated with the incommensurate helical spin order is
reduced by pressure and ferroelectricity is completely suppressed at the
critical pressure of 1.64 GPa at 6.2 K. Thermal expansion measurements at
ambient pressure show strong step-like anomalies of the lattice parameters
associated with the lock-in transition into the commensurate paraelectric
phase. The expansion anomalies are highly anisotropic, the related volume
change is consistent with the high-pressure phase diagram.",2007-01-23T23:41:25Z
A Landscape Analysis of Constraint Satisfaction Problems,"We discuss an analysis of Constraint Satisfaction problems, such as Sphere
Packing, K-SAT and Graph Coloring, in terms of an effective energy landscape.
Several intriguing geometrical properties of the solution space become in this
light familiar in terms of the well-studied ones of rugged (glassy) energy
landscapes. A `benchmark' algorithm naturally suggested by this construction
finds solutions in polynomial time up to a point beyond the `clustering' and in
some cases even the `thermodynamic' transitions. This point has a simple
geometric meaning and can be in principle determined with standard Statistical
Mechanical methods, thus pushing the analytic bound up to which problems are
guaranteed to be easy. We illustrate this for the graph three and four-coloring
problem. For Packing problems the present discussion allows to better
characterize the `J-point', proposed as a systematic definition of Random Close
Packing, and to place it in the context of other theories of glasses.",2007-02-23T15:25:30Z
"Dynamics and rheology of a dilute suspension of vesicles: higher order
  theory","Vesicles under shear flow exhibit various dynamics: tank-treading ($tt$),
tumbling ($tb$) and vacillating-breathing ($vb$). A consistent higher order
theory reveals a direct bifurcation from $tt$ to $tb$ if $C_a\equiv \tau
\dot\gamma $ is small enough ($\tau$= vesicle relaxation time towards
equilibrium shape, $\dot\gamma$=shear rate). At larger $C_a$ the $tb$ is
preceded by the $vb$ mode. For $C_a\gg 1$ we recover the leading order original
calculation, where the $vb$ mode coexists with $tb$. The consistent calculation
reveals several quantitative discrepancies with recent works, and points to new
features. We analyse rheology and find that the effective viscosity exhibits a
minimum at $tt-tb$ and $tt-vb$ bifurcation points.",2007-03-27T07:13:30Z
"Influence of Point-like Disorder on the Guiding of Vortices and the Hall
  Effect in a Washboard Planar Pinning Potential","Explicit current-dependent expressions for anisotropic longitudinal and
transverse nonlinear magnetoresistivities are represented and analyzed on the
basis of a Fokker-Planck approach for two-dimensional single-vortex dynamics in
a washboard pinning potential in the presence of point-like disorder. Graphical
analysis of the resistive responses is presented both in the current-angle
coordinates and in the rotating current scheme. The model describes nonlinear
anisotropy effects caused by the competition of point-like (isotropic) and
anisotropic pinning. Nonlinear guiding effects are discussed and the critical
current anisotropy is analyzed. Gradually increasing the magnitude of isotropic
pinning force this theory predicts a gradual decrease of the anisotropy of the
magnetoresistivities. The physics of transition from the new scaling relations
for anisotropic Hall resistance in the absence of point-like pins to the
well-known scaling relations for the point-like disorder is elucidated. This is
discussed in terms of a gradual isotropizaton of the guided vortex motion,
which is responsible for the existence in a washboard pinning potential of new
(with respect to magnetic field reversal) Hall voltages. It is shown that
whereas the Hall conductivity is not changed by pinning, the Hall resistivity
can change its sign in some current-angle range due to presence of the
competition between i- and a-pins.",2007-01-22T18:23:56Z
Spin qubits with electrically gated polyoxometalate molecules,"Spin qubits offer one of the most promising routes to the implementation of
quantum computers. Very recent results in semiconductor quantum dots show that
electrically-controlled gating schemes are particularly well-suited for the
realization of a universal set of quantum logical gates. Scalability to a
larger number of qubits, however, remains an issue for such semiconductor
quantum dots. In contrast, a chemical bottom-up approach allows one to produce
identical units in which localized spins represent the qubits. Molecular
magnetism has produced a wide range of systems with tailored properties, but
molecules permitting electrical gating have been lacking. Here we propose to
use the polyoxometalate [PMo12O40(VO)2]q-, where two localized spins-1/2 can be
coupled through the electrons of the central core. Via electrical manipulation
of the molecular redox potential, the charge of the core can be changed. With
this setup, two-qubit gates and qubit readout can be implemented.",2007-03-19T20:21:01Z
Degenerate Fermi gas in a combined harmonic-lattice potential,"In this paper we derive an analytic approximation to the density of states
for atoms in a combined optical lattice and harmonic trap potential as used in
current experiments with quantum degenerate gases. We compare this analytic
density of states to numerical solutions and demonstrate its validity regime.
Our work explicitly considers the role of higher bands and when they are
important in quantitative analysis of this system. Applying our density of
states to a degenerate Fermi gas we consider how adiabatic loading from a
harmonic trap into the combined harmonic-lattice potential affects the
degeneracy temperature. Our results suggest that occupation of excited bands
during loading should lead to more favourable conditions for realizing
degenerate Fermi gases in optical lattices.",2007-03-27T22:26:46Z
Ostwald ripening of faceted two-dimensional islands,"We study Ostwald ripening of two-dimensional adatom and advacancy islands on
a crystal surface by means of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. At large bond
energies the islands are square-shaped, which qualitatively changes the
coarsening kinetics. The Gibbs--Thomson chemical potential is violated: the
coarsening proceeds through a sequence of `magic' sizes corresponding to square
or rectangular islands. The coarsening becomes attachment-limited, but Wagner's
asymptotic law is reached after a very long transient time. The unusual
coarsening kinetics obtained in Monte Carlo simulations are well described by
the Becker--D\""oring equations of nucleation kinetics. These equations can be
applied to a wide range of coarsening problems.",2007-01-15T16:26:21Z
"Introduction to the theory of stochastic processes and Brownian motion
  problems","These notes are an introduction to the theory of stochastic processes based
on several sources. The presentation mainly follows the books of van Kampen and
Wio, except for the introduction, which is taken from the book of Gardiner and
the parts devoted to the Langevin equation and the methods for solving Langevin
and Fokker-Planck equations, which are based on the book of Risken.",2007-01-11T13:57:31Z
"Density functional approach to study structural properties and Electric
  Field Gradients in rare earth materials","We investigated the effect of spin polarization on the structural properties
and gradient of electric field (EFG) on Sn, In, and Cd impurity in RSn$_3$
(R=Sm, Eu, Gd) and RIn$_3$ (R=Tm, Yb, Lu) compounds. The calculations were
performed self-consistently using the scalar-relativistic full potential
linearized augmented plane wave method. The local density approximations (LDA)
and generalized gradient approximation without spin polarization (GGA) and with
spin polarization (GGA+SP) to density functional theory were applied. In
addition to that we performed some calculations within open core treatment
(GGA+open core). It is clearly seen that GGA+SP is successful in predicting the
larger lattice parameter and the dramatic drop of EFG for R=(Eu, Yb) relative
to other rare earth compounds. This is an indication that spin splitting
generated by spin polarization without any modification, is capable of treating
properly the highly correlated f electrons in these systems.",2007-01-23T16:44:04Z
"Valence bond solids for SU(n) spin chains: exact models, spinon
  confinement, and the Haldane gap","To begin with, we introduce several exact models for SU(3) spin chains: (1) a
translationally invariant parent Hamiltonian involving four-site interactions
for the trimer chain, with a three-fold degenerate ground state. We provide
numerical evidence that the elementary excitations of this model transform
under representation 3bar of SU(3) if the original spins of the model transform
under rep. 3. (2) a family of parent Hamiltonians for valence bond solids of
SU(3) chains with spin reps. 6, 10, and 8 on each lattice site. We argue that
of these three models, only the latter two exhibit spinon confinement and hence
a Haldane gap in the excitation spectrum. We generalize some of our models to
SU(n). Finally, we use the emerging rules for the construction of VBS states to
argue that models of antiferromagnetic chains of SU(n) spins in general possess
a Haldane gap if the spins transform under a representation corresponding to a
Young tableau consisting of a number of boxes \lambda which is divisible by n.
If \lambda and n have no common divisor, the spin chain will support deconfined
spinons and not exhibit a Haldane gap. If \lambda and n have a common divisor
different from n, it will depend on the specifics of the model including the
range of the interaction.",2007-02-19T17:13:52Z
Effect of the Inverse Volume Modification in Loop Quantum Cosmology,"It is known that in loop quantum cosmology (LQC) the universe avoids the
singularity by a bounce when the matter density approaches the critical density
$\rho_c$ (the order of Planck density). After incorporating the inverse volume
modifications both in the gravitational and matter part in the improved
framework of LQC, we find that the inverse volume modification can decrease the
bouncing energy scale, and the presence of nonsingular bounce is generic. For
the backward evolution in the expanding branch, in terms of different initial
states the evolution trajectories classify into two classes. One class with
larger initial energy density leads to the occurrence of bounce in the region
$a>a_{ch}$ where $a_{ch}$ marks the different inverse volume modification
region. The other class with smaller initial energy density evolves back into
the region $a<a_{ch}$. In this region, both the energy density for the scalar
field and the bouncing energy scale decrease with the backward evolution.
However, in the deep modification region, because of the inverse volume
modification the scalar field is frozen, such that the bounce is present when
the bouncing energy scale decreases to be equal to the energy density of the
scalar field. Using numerical method, we show the evolution picture for the
second class bounce.",2007-02-01T04:58:06Z
Making a splash with water repellency,"A 'splash' is usually heard when a solid body enters water at large velocity.
This phenomena originates from the formation of an air cavity resulting from
the complex transient dynamics of the free interface during the impact. The
classical picture of impacts on free surfaces relies solely on fluid inertia,
arguing that surface properties and viscous effects are negligible at
sufficiently large velocities. In strong contrast to this large-scale
hydrodynamic viewpoint, we demonstrate in this study that the wettability of
the impacting body is a key factor in determining the degree of splashing. This
unexpected result is illustrated in Fig.1: a large cavity is evident for an
impacting hydrophobic sphere (1.b), contrasting with the hydrophilic sphere's
impact under the very same conditions (1.a). This unforeseen fact is
furthermore embodied in the dependence of the threshold velocity for air
entrainment on the contact angle of the impacting body, as well as on the ratio
between the surface tension and fluid viscosity, thereby defining a critical
capillary velocity. As a paradigm, we show that superhydrophobic impacters make
a big 'splash' for any impact velocity. This novel understanding provides a new
perspective for impacts on free surfaces, and reveals that modifications of the
detailed nature of the surface -- involving physico-chemical aspects at the
nanometric scales -- provide an efficient and versatile strategy for
controlling the water entry of solid bodies at high velocity.",2007-01-05T07:39:32Z
"Stochastic Models of Evolution in Genetics, Ecology and Linguistics","We give a overview of stochastic models of evolution that have found
applications in genetics, ecology and linguistics for an audience of
nonspecialists, especially statistical physicists. In particular, we focus
mostly on neutral models in which no intrinsic advantage is ascribed to a
particular type of the variable unit, for example a gene, appearing in the
theory. In many cases these models are exactly solvable and furthermore go some
way to describing observed features of genetic, ecological and linguistic
systems.",2007-03-19T09:17:18Z
"Surface spin dynamics of antiferromagnetically coupled frustrated
  triangular films","Results are presented for spin-wave dispersions in geometrically frustrated
stacked triangular antiferromagnets with a thin film or semi-infinite geometry
having either zero, easy-plane, or easy-axis anisotropy. Surface effects on the
equilibrium spin configurations and excitation spectrum are investigated for
the case of antiferromagnetically coupled films, serving to extend previous
results on ferromagnetically coupled layers [E. Meloche et al., Phys. Rev. B
74, 094424 (2006)]. An operator equation of motion formalism is applied to
systems which are quasi-one and quasi-two dimensional in character. In contrast
to the case of ferromagnetically coupled films the new results show surface
modes that are well separated in frequency from bulk excitations. Magnetic
excitations in thin films with an even or an odd number of layers show
qualitatively different behavior. These results are relevant for a wide variety
of stacked triangular antiferromagnetics materials.",2007-02-26T16:35:10Z
"Extensions to the Kondo lattice model to achieve realistic Curie
  temperatures and appropriate behavior of the resistivity for manganites","We investigate the influence of the Jahn-Teller distortion and a direct
antiferromagnetic moment coupling as extensions to a two-band Kondo lattice
model for the magnetic and electronic properties of manganites. Those are
calculated self-consistently via an interpolating self-energy model and a
modified RKKY technique using finite Hund coupling and quantum spins. We found
that both effects are essential to achieve realistic Curie temperatures if we
regard intraband Coulomb repulsion. Using reliable model parameters we got
results which are in very good agreement with experimental data in the whole
ferromagnetic doping range. In the calculated phase diagram there are
ferromagnetic metal to paramagnetic insulator transitions, accompanied by a
Colossal Magnetoresistance (CMR) behavior. To improve the comparability of the
measured behavior of the resistivity with the calculated one, we have to switch
on interband Coulomb correlations.",2007-02-26T11:09:34Z
Vortex mass in a superfluid at low frequencies,"An inertial mass of a vortex can be calculated by driving it round in a
circle with a steadily revolving pinning potential. We show that in the low
frequency limit this gives precisely the same formula that was used by Baym and
Chandler, but find that the result is not unique and depends on the force field
used to cause the acceleration. We apply this method to the Gross-Pitaevskii
model, and derive a simple formula for the vortex mass. We study both the long
range and short range properties of the solution. We agree with earlier results
that the non-zero compressibility leads to a divergent mass. From the
short-range behavior of the solution we find that the mass is sensitive to the
form of the pinning potential, and diverges logarithmically when the radius of
this potential tends to zero.",2007-03-20T17:04:53Z
The structure of the nuclear stellar cluster of the Milky Way,"We present high-resolution seeing limited and AO NIR imaging observations of
the stellar cluster within about one parsec of Sgr A*, the massive black hole
at the centre of the Milky Way. Stellar number counts and the diffuse
background light density were extracted from these observations in order to
examine the structure of the nuclear stellar cluster.Our findings are as
follows: (a) A broken-power law provides an excellent fit to the overall
structure of the GC nuclear cluster. The power-law slope of the cusp is
$\Gamma=0.19\pm0.05$, the break radius is $R_{\rm break} = 6.0'' \pm 1.0''$ or
$0.22\pm0.04$ pc, and the cluster density decreases with a power-law index of
$\Gamma=0.75\pm0.1$ outside of $R_{\rm break}$. (b) Using the best velocity
dispersion measurements from the literature, we derive higher mass estimates
for the central parsec than assumed until now. The inferred density of the
cluster at the break radius is $2.8\pm1.3\times 10^{6} {\rm M_{\odot}
pc^{-3}}$. This high density agrees well with the small extent and flat slope
of the cusp. Possibly, the mass of the stars makes up only about 50% of the
total cluster mass. (c) Possible indications of mass segregation in the cusp
are found (d) The cluster appears not entirely homogeneous. Several density
clumps are detected that are concentrated at projected distances of $R=3''$ and
$R=7''$ from Sgr A*.(e) There appears to exist an under-density of horizontal
branch/red clump stars near $R=5''$, or an over-density of stars of similar
brightness at $R=3''$ and $R=7''$. (f) The extinction map in combination with
cometary-like features in an L'-band image may provide support for the
assumption of an outflow from Sgr A*.",2007-03-08T14:13:52Z
"New method for studying steady states in quantum impurity problems: The
  interacting resonant level model","We develop a new perturbative method for studying any steady states of
quantum impurities, in or out of equilibrium. We show that steady-state
averages are completely fixed by basic properties of the steady-state
(Hershfield's) density matrix along with dynamical ""impurity conditions"". This
gives the full perturbative expansion without Feynman diagrams (matrix products
instead are used), and ""re-sums"" into an equilibrium average that may lend
itself to numerical procedures. We calculate the universal current in the
interacting resonant level model (IRLM) at finite bias V to first order in
Coulomb repulsion U for all V and temperatures. We find that the bias, like the
temperature, cuts off low-energy processes. In the IRLM, this implies a
power-law decay of the current at large V (also recently observed by Boulat and
Saleur at some finite value of U).",2007-03-09T14:45:36Z
"Investigation of $q$-dependent dynamical heterogeneity in a colloidal
  gel by x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy","We use time-resolved X-Photon Correlation Spectroscopy to investigate the
slow dynamics of colloidal gels made of moderately attractive carbon black
particles. We show that the slow dynamics is temporally heterogeneous and
quantify its fluctuations by measuring the variance $\chi$ of the instantaneous
intensity correlation function. The amplitude of dynamical fluctuations has a
non-monotonic dependence on scattering vector $q$, in stark contrast with
recent experiments on strongly attractive colloidal gels [Duri and Cipelletti,
\textit{Europhys. Lett.} \textbf{76}, 972 (2006)]. We propose a simple scaling
argument for the $q$-dependence of fluctuations in glassy systems that
rationalizes these findings.",2007-02-27T16:07:58Z
"The Multiplexing Gain of MIMO X-Channels with Partial Transmit
  Side-Information","In this paper, we obtain the scaling laws of the sum-rate capacity of a MIMO
X-channel, a 2 independent sender, 2 independent receiver channel with messages
from each transmitter to each receiver, at high signal to noise ratios (SNR).
The X-channel has sparked recent interest in the context of cooperative
networks and it encompasses the interference, multiple access, and broadcast
channels as special cases. Here, we consider the case with partially
cooperative transmitters in which only partial and asymmetric side-information
is available at one of the transmitters. It is proved that when there are M
antennas at all four nodes, the sum-rate scales like 2Mlog(SNR) which is in
sharp contrast to [\lfloor 4M/3 \rfloor,4M/3]log(SNR) for non-cooperative
X-channels \cite{maddah-ali,jafar_degrees}. This further proves that, in terms
of sum-rate scaling at high SNR, partial side-information at one of the
transmitters and full side-information at both transmitters are equivalent in
the MIMO X-channel.",2007-01-15T18:40:41Z
"Self-organization of charged particles on a 2D lattice subject to
  anisotropic Jahn-Teller-type interaction and 3D Coulomb repulsion","Self-organization of charged particles on a 2D lattice, subject to an
anisotropic Jahn-Teller-type interaction and 3D Coulomb repulsion is
investigated. In the mean-field approximation without Coulomb interaction, the
system displays a phase transition of first order. In the presence of the
Coulomb repulsion the global phase separation becomes unfavorable and the
system shows a mesoscopic phase separation, where the size of the charged
regions is determined by the competition between the ordering energy and the
Coulomb energy.
  The phase diagram of the system as a function of particle density and
temperature is obtained by systematic Monte Carlo simulations. With decreasing
temperature a crossover from a disordered state to a state composed from
mesoscopic charged clusters is observed. In the phase separated state charged
clusters with even number of particles are more stable than those with odd
number of particles in a large range of particle densities. With increasing
particle density at low temperatures a series of crossovers between states with
different cluster sizes is observed. Above half filling in addition to the low
temperature clustering another higher temperature scale, which corresponds to
orbital ordering of particles, appears.
  We suggest that the diverse functional behaviour - including
superconductivity - observed in transition metal oxides can be thought to arise
from the self-organization of this type.",2007-03-23T16:25:13Z
"Astrometric-spectroscopic determination of the absolute masses of the
  HgMn binary star Phi Herculis","The Mercury-Manganese star Phi Her is a well known spectroscopic binary that
has been the subject of a recent study by Zavala et al. (2006), in which they
resolved the companion using long-baseline interferometry. The total mass of
the binary is now fairly well established, but the combination of the
spectroscopy with the astrometry has not resulted in individual masses
consistent with the spectral types of the components. The motion of the center
of light of Phi Her was clearly detected by the Hipparcos satellite. Here we
make use of the Hipparcos intermediate data (`abscissa residuals') and show
that by combining them in an optimal fashion with the interferometry the
individual masses can be obtained reliably using only astrometry. We re-examine
and then incorporate existing radial-velocity measurements into the orbital

M_Sun that are consistent with the theoretical mass-luminosity relation from
recent stellar evolution models. These mass determinations provide important
information for the understanding of the nature of this peculiar class of
stars.",2007-03-08T21:00:13Z
DNA unzipping phase diagram calculated via replica theory,"We show how single-molecule unzipping experiments can provide strong evidence
that the zero-force melting transition of long molecules of natural dsDNA
should be classified as a phase transition of the higher-order type
(continuous). We study a model for a long molecule of dsDNA, and compute the
equilibrium phase diagram for the experiment in which the molecule is unzipped
under force. We consider a perfect-matching dsDNA model, in which the loops are
volume-excluding chains with arbitrary loop exponent c. We include stacking
interactions, hydrogen bonds, and main-chain entropy, including sequence
heterogeneity at the level of random sequences. We use the replica method to
calculate the equilibrium properties of the system. As a function of
temperature, we obtain the minimal force at which the molecule separates
completely. This critical force curve is a line in the temperature-force phase
diagram that marks the regions where the molecule exists primarily as a helix,
versus the region where the molecule exists as two separate strands. Near
melting, the critical force curve of our random-sequence model is very
different from that of the homogeneous version of our model. For both sequence
models, the critical force falls to zero at the melting temperature with a
power law having exponent alpha. For the homogeneous model, alpha is 1/2 almost
exactly, while for the random model, alpha is about 0.9. The shape of the
critical force determines how the helix fraction falls to zero at melting, and
thus classifies the melting transition as a type of phase transition.",2007-03-22T16:53:06Z
"Anomalous Orbital Magnetism and Hall Effect of Massless Fermions in Two
  Dimension","Inter-band effects of magnetic field on orbital magnetic susceptibility and
Hall effect in weak magnetic field have been studied theoretically at absolute
zero for the model of massless Fermions in two dimension described by Weyl
equation similar to graphenes, which are simplified version of newly found one
in molecular solids, arfa-ET2I3 described by ""tilted Weyl"" equation. The
dependences on the Fermi energy of both orbital susceptibility and Hall
conductivity near the zero-gap region scale with elastic scattering time and
then are very singular.",2007-03-01T02:25:58Z
"Synchronizability determined by coupling strengths and topology on
  Complex Networks","We investigate in depth the synchronization of coupled oscillators on top of
complex networks with different degrees of heterogeneity within the context of
the Kuramoto model. In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 034101 (2007)],
we unveiled how for fixed coupling strengths local patterns of synchronization
emerge differently in homogeneous and heterogeneous complex networks. Here, we
provide more evidence on this phenomenon extending the previous work to
networks that interpolate between homogeneous and heterogeneous topologies. We
also present new details on the path towards synchronization for the evolution
of clustering in the synchronized patterns. Finally, we investigate the
synchronization of networks with modular structure and conclude that, in these
cases, local synchronization is first attained at the most internal level of
organization of modules, progressively evolving to the outer levels as the
coupling constant is increased. The present work introduces new parameters that
are proved to be useful for the characterization of synchronization phenomena
in complex networks.",2007-02-06T11:48:56Z
"Entropy of entanglement and correlations induced by a quench: Dynamics
  of a quantum phase transition in the quantum Ising model","Quantum Ising model in one dimension is an exactly solvable example of a
quantum phase transition. We investigate its behavior during a quench from a
paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase caused by a gradual turning off of the
transverse field at a fixed rate characterized by the quench time $\tau_Q$. In
agreement with Kibble-Zurek mechanism, quantum state of the system after the
transition exhibits a characteristic correlation length $\hat\xi$ proportional
to the square root of the quench time $\tau_Q$. The inverse of this correlation
length determines average density of defects after the transition. In this
paper, we show that $\hat\xi$ also controls the entropy of entanglement of a
block of $L$ spins with the rest of the system. For large $L$, this entropy
saturates at $\frac16\log_2\hat\xi$, as might have been expected from the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Close to the critical point, the entropy saturates when
the block size $L\approx\hat\xi$, but -- in the subsequent evolution in the
ferromagnetic phase -- a somewhat larger length scale
$l=\sqrt{\tau_Q}\ln\tau_Q$ develops as a result of quantum dephasing, and the
entropy saturates when $L\approx l$. We also study the spin-spin correlation.
We find that close to the critical point ferromagnetic correlations decay
exponentially with the dynamical correlation length $\hat\xi$, but in the
following evolution this correlation function becomes oscillatory at distances
less than this scale. However, both the wavelength and the correlation length
of these oscillations are still determined by $\hat\xi$. We also derive
probability distribution for the number of kinks in a finite spin chain after
the transition.",2007-01-31T07:44:15Z
"Multiphase structure of finite-temperature phase diagram of the
  Blume-Capel model. Wang-Landau sampling method","We investigate the density of states (DOS) in an antiferromagnetic
spin-system on a square lattice described by the Blume-Capel (BC) model. We use
a new and very efficient simulation method, proposed by Wang and Landau, in
which we estimate very precisely DOS by sampling in the space of energy. Then
we calculate the thermodynamical averages like internal energy, free energy,
specific heat and entropy. The BC model exhibits multicritical behaviour such
as first- or second-order transitions and tricritical points. It is known that
the ground state of the model can exhibit two kinds of staggered
antiferromagnetic phases: AF1 (two interpenetrating lattices with S = -1 and S
= 1) and AF2 (S = -1 and S = 0 for H < 0; S = 1 and S = 0 for H > 0). We
analyze the coexistence of such phases at finite temperatures and determine
border lines between them. To understand the microscopic nature of such
boundaries we present also some results obtained with the standard Monte Carlo
method.",2007-03-12T15:53:06Z
Modeling microscopic swimmers at low Reynolds number,"We employ three numerical methods to explore the motion of low Reynolds
number swimmers, modeling the hydrodynamic interactions by means of the Oseen
tensor approximation, lattice Boltzmann simulations and multiparticle collision
dynamics. By applying the methods to a three bead linear swimmer, for which
exact results are known, we are able to compare and assess the effectiveness of
the different approaches. We then propose a new class of low Reynolds number
swimmers, generalized three bead swimmers that can change both the length of
their arms and the angle between them. Hence we suggest a design for a
microstructure capable of moving in three dimensions. We discuss multiple bead,
linear microstructures and show that they are highly efficient swimmers. We
then turn to consider the swimming motion of elastic filaments. Using
multiparticle collision dynamics we show that a driven filament behaves in a
qualitatively similar way to the micron-scale swimming device recently
demonstrated by Dreyfus et al.",2007-01-22T10:35:21Z
"Molecular model for de Vries type smectic A - smectic C phase transition
  in liquid crystals","We develop a theory of Smectic A - Smectic C phase transition with
anomalously weak smectic layer contraction. We construct a phenomenological
description of this transition by generalizing the Chen-Lubensky model. Using a
mean-field molecular model, we demonstrate that a relatively simple interaction
potential suffices to describe the transition. The theoretical results are in
excellent agreement with experimental data.",2007-01-23T14:16:10Z
"Feedback from supercritical disk accretion flows; Two-dimensional
  radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of stable and unstable disks with
  radiatively driven outflows","The supercritical disk accretion flow with radiatively driven outflows is
studied based on two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations for a wide
range of the mass input rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm input}$, which is the mass supplied
from the outer region to the disk per unit time. The $\alpha$-prescription is
adopted for the viscosity. We employ $\alpha=0.5$, as well as $\alpha=0.1$ for
$\dot{M}_{\rm input}\ge 3\times 10^2L_{\rm E}/c^2$ and only $\alpha=0.5$ for
$\dot{M}_{\rm input}\le 10^2L_{\rm E}/c^2$, where $L_{\rm E}$ is the Eddington
luminosity and $c$ is the speed of light. The quasi-steady disk and radiately
driven outflows form in the case in which the mass input rate highly exceeds
the critical rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm input}>3\times 10^2 L_{\rm E}/c^2$. Then, the
disk luminosity as well as the kinetic energy output rate by the outflow
exceeds the Eddington luminosity. The moderately supercritical disk,
$\dot{M}_{\rm input}\sim 10-10^2 L_{\rm E}/c^2$, exhibits limit-cycle
oscillations. The disk luminosity goes up and down across the Eddington
luminosity, and the radiatively driven outflows intermittently appear. The time
averaged mass, momentum, and kinetic energy output rates by the outflow as well
as the disk luminosity increase with increase of the mass input rate, $\propto
\dot{M}_{\rm input}^{0.7-1.0}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $\propto \dot{M}_{\rm
input}^{0.4-0.6}$ for $\alpha=0.1$. Our numerical simulations show that the
radiatively driven outflow model for the correlation between black hole mass
and bulge velocity dispersion proposed by \citeauthor{SR98} and
\citeauthor{King03} is successful if $\dot{M}_{\rm input}c^2/L_{\rm E} \sim$ a
few 10 ($\alpha=0.5$) or $\gsim$ a few ($\alpha=0.1$).",2007-03-06T08:26:22Z
A Numerical Renormalization Group for Continuum One-Dimensional Systems,"We present a renormalization group (RG) procedure which works naturally on a
wide class of interacting one-dimension models based on perturbed (possibly
strongly) continuum conformal and integrable models. This procedure integrates
Kenneth Wilson's numerical renormalization group with Al. B. Zamolodchikov's
truncated conformal spectrum approach. Key to the method is that such theories
provide a set of completely understood eigenstates for which matrix elements
can be exactly computed. In this procedure the RG flow of physical observables
can be studied both numerically and analytically. To demonstrate the approach,
we study the spectrum of a pair of coupled quantum Ising chains and correlation
functions in a single quantum Ising chain in the presence of a magnetic field.",2007-01-24T22:34:18Z
Stationary spatial structures in reaction-subdiffusion,"We discuss stationary concentrations of reactants in an A + B -> 0 reaction
under subdiffusion and show that they are described by stationary
reaction-diffusion equations with a nonlinear diffusion term. We consider
stationary profiles of reactants' concentrations and of reaction zones in a
flat subdiffusive medium fed by reactants of both types on its both sides (a
subdiffusive gel reactor). The behavior of the concentrations and of the
reaction intensity in subdiffusion differs strikingly from those in simple
diffusion. The most important differences correspond to the existence of
accumulation and depletion zones close to the boundaries and to non-monotonous
behavior of the reaction intensity with respect to the strength of the minor
source. The implications of these results for other situations are also
discussed.",2007-03-08T14:42:14Z
Theory of Optical Transmission through Elliptical Nanohole Arrays,"We present a theory which explains (in the quasistatic limit) the
experimentally observed [R. Gordon, {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92},
037401 (2004)] squared dependence of the depolarization ratio on the aspect
ratio of the holes, as well as other features of extraordinary light
transition. We calculated the effective dielectric tensor of a metal film
penetrated by elliptical cylindrical holes and found the extraordinarily light
transmission at special frequencies related to the surface plasmon resonances
of the composite film. We also propose to use the magnetic field for getting a
strong polarization effect, which depends on the ratio of the cyclotron to
plasmon frequencies.",2007-02-01T22:50:05Z
"Blind MD-MC Component Separation for Polarized Observations of the CMB
  with the EM Algorithm","We present the PolEMICA [Aumont & Macias-Perez 2007] (Polarized
Expectation-Maximization Independent Component Analysis) algorithm which is an
extension to polarization of the SMICA [Delabrouille et al. 2003] temperature
component separation method. This algorithm allows us to estimate blindly in
harmonic space multiple physical components from multi-detectors polarized sky
maps. Assuming a linear noisy mixture of components we are able to reconstruct
jointly the electromagnetic spectra of the components for each mode T, E and B,
as well as the temperature and polarization spatial power spectra, TT, EE, BB,
TE, TB and EB for each of the physical components and for the noise on each of
the detectors. This has been tested using full sky simulations of the Planck
satellite polarized channels for a 14-months nominal mission assuming a simple
linear sky model including CMB, and optionally Galactic synchrotron and dust
emissions.",2007-03-12T13:08:48Z
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov State in Heavy Fermion Superconductors,"The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state is a novel superconducting
state in a strong magnetic field characterized by the formation of Cooper pairs
with nonzero total momentum (k \uparrow, -k+q \downarrow), instead of the
ordinary BCS pairs (k \uparrow, -k \downarrow). A fascinating aspect of the
FFLO state is that it exhibits inhomogeneous superconducting phases with a
spatially oscillating order parameter and spin polarization. The FFLO state has
been of interest in various research fields, not only in superconductors in
solid state physics, but also in neutral Fermion superfluid of ultracold atomic
gases and in color superconductivity in high energy physics. In spite of
extensive studies of various superconductors, there has been no undisputed
experimental verification of the FFLO state, mainly because of the very
stringent conditions required of the superconducting materials. Among several
classes of materials, certain heavy fermion and organic superconductors are
believed to provide conditions that are favorable to the formation of the FFLO
state. This review presents recent experimental and theoretical developments of
the FFLO state mainly in heavy fermion superconductors. In particular we
address the recently discovered quasi-two-dimensional superconductor CeCoIn_5,
which is a strong candidate for the formation of the FFLO state.",2007-02-21T03:22:55Z

  Polarization, Magnetoelectric Effect and Orbital State","A layered iron oxide \rfeo ($R$: rare-earth elements) is an exotic dielectric
material with charge-order (CO) driven electric polarization and
magnetoelectric effect caused by spin-charge coupling. In this paper, a theory
of electronic structure and dielectric property in \rfeo is presented. Charge
frustration in paired-triangular lattices allows a charge imbalance without
inversion symmetry. Spin frustration induces reinforcement of this polar CO by
a magnetic ordering. We also analyze an orbital model for the Fe ion which does
not show a conventional long-range order.",2007-02-05T05:32:53Z
Reversible gelation and dynamical arrest of dipolar colloids,"We use molecular dynamics simulations of a simple model to show that
dispersions of slightly elongated colloidal particles with long-range dipolar
interactions, like ferrofluids, can form a physical (reversible) gel at low
volume fractions. On cooling, the particles first self-assemble into a
transient percolating network of cross-linked chains, which, at much lower
temperatures, then undergoes a kinetic transition to a dynamically arrested
state with broken ergodicity. This transition from a transient to a frozen gel
is characterised by dynamical signatures reminiscent of jamming in much denser
dispersions.",2007-03-06T16:22:47Z
A transition from river networks to scale-free networks,"A spatial network is constructed on a two dimensional space where the nodes
are geometrical points located at randomly distributed positions which are
labeled sequentially in increasing order of one of their co-ordinates. Starting
with $N$ such points the network is grown by including them one by one
according to the serial number into the growing network. The $t$-th point is
attached to the $i$-th node of the network using the probability: $\pi_i(t)
\sim k_i(t)\ell_{ti}^{\alpha}$ where $k_i(t)$ is the degree of the $i$-th node
and $\ell_{ti}$ is the Euclidean distance between the points $t$ and $i$. Here
$\alpha$ is a continuously tunable parameter and while for $\alpha=0$ one gets
the simple Barab\'asi-Albert network, the case for $\alpha \to -\infty$
corresponds to the spatially continuous version of the well known Scheidegger's
river network problem. The modulating parameter $\alpha$ is tuned to study the
transition between the two different critical behaviors at a specific value
$\alpha_c$ which we numerically estimate to be -2.",2007-01-11T14:17:28Z
"Statistics of random voltage fluctuations and the low-density residual
  conductivity of graphene","We consider a graphene sheet in the vicinity of a substrate, which contains
charged impurities. An analytic expression for the probability distribution
function of voltage fluctuations due to the charged impurities is derived. The
distribution function is shown to be non-Gaussian. The voltage fluctuations
lead to the appearance of randomly distributed density inhomogeneities in the
graphene plane. We argue that these disorder-induced density fluctuations
produce a finite conductivity even at a zero gate voltage in accordance with
recent experimental observations. We estimate the width of the minimal
conductivity plateau and the typical size of the electron and hole puddles. The
existence of inhomogeneous random puddles of electrons and holes should be a
generic feature of all graphene layers at low gate voltages due to the
invariable presence of charged impurities in the substrate.",2007-02-05T21:04:09Z
Renormalization of the Lattice Boltzmann Hierarchy,"Is it possible to solve Boltzmann-type kinetic equations using only a small
number of particles velocities? We introduce a novel techniques of solving

only a lattice Boltzmann method on standard, low-symmetry lattices. The
renormalized kinetic equation is validated with the exact solution of the
planar Couette flow at moderate Knudsen numbers.",2007-03-16T15:16:34Z
"Oxygen isotope effect on the superconductivity and stripe phase in
  La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$","The oxygen isotope effect on the superconductivity, stripe phase and
structure transition is systematically investigated in
La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ with static stripe phase. Substitution of
$^{16}$O by $^{18}$O leads to a decrease in superconducting transition
temperature T$_C$, while enhances the temperature of the structural transition
from low-temperature-orthorhombic (LTO) phase to low-temperature-tetragonal
(LTT) phase. Compared to the Nd free sample, a larger isotope effect on $T_C$
is observed in La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$. These results indicate
that the distortion of CuO$_2$ plane suppresses the superconductivity, giving a
direct evidence for the competing of stripe phase and superconductivity because
the distortion of CuO$_2$ plane enhances the stripe phase.",2007-03-25T13:41:28Z
"Upper critical field divergence induced by mesoscopic phase separation
  in the organic superconductor (TMTSF)2ReO4","Due to the competition of two anion orders, (TMTSF)2ReO4, presents a phase
coexistence between semiconducting and metallic (superconducting) regions
(filaments or droplets) in a wide range of pressure. In this regime, the
superconducting upper critical field for H parallel to both c* and b' axes
present a linear part at low fields followed by a divergence above a cross-over
field. This cross-over corresponds to the 3D-2D decoupling transition expected
in filamentary or granular superconductors. The sharpness of the transition
also demonstrates that all filaments are of similar sizes and self organize in
a very ordered way. The distance between the filaments and their cross-section
are estimated.",2007-01-26T14:34:51Z
Photoconductivity of Single-crystalline Selenium Nanotubes,"Photoconductivity of single-crystalline selenium nanotubes (SCSNT) under a
range of illumination intensities of a 633nm laser is carried out with a novel
two terminal device arrangement at room temperature. It's found that SCSNT
forms Schottky barriers with the W and Au contacts, and the barrier height is a
function of the light intensities. In low illumination regime below 1.46x10E-4
muWmum-2, the Au-Se-W hybrid structure exhibits sharp switch on/off behavior,
and the turn-on voltages decrease with increasing illuminating intensities. In
the high illumination regime above 7x10E-4 muWmum-2, the device exhibits ohmic
conductance with a photoconductivity as high as 0.59Ohmcm-1, significantly
higher that reported values for carbon and GaN nanotubes. This finding suggests
that SCSNT is potentially a good photo-sensor material as well we a very
effective solar cell material.",2007-02-05T06:34:18Z
"Defects-driven appearance of half-metallic ferrimagnetism in
  Co-Mn--based Heusler alloys","Half-metallic ferromagnetic full-Heusler alloys containing Co and Mn, having
the formula Co$_2$MnZ where Z a sp element, are among the most studied Heusler
alloys due to their stable ferromagnetism and the high Curie temperatures which
they present. Using state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations we show
that when Mn atoms migrate to sites occupied in the perfect alloys by Co, these
Mn atoms have spin moments antiparallel to the other transition metal atoms.
The ferrimagnetic compounds, which result from this procedure, keep the
half-metallic character of the parent compounds and the large
exchange-splitting of the Mn impurities atoms only marginally affects the width
of the gap in the minority-spin band. The case of [Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$]$_2$MnSi is
of particular interest since Mn$_3$Si is known to crystallize in the Heusler
$L2_1$ lattice structure of Co$_2$MnZ compounds. Robust half-metallic
ferrimagnets are highly desirable for realistic applications since they lead to
smaller energy losses due to the lower external magnetic fields created with
respect to their ferromagnetic counterparts.",2007-02-19T13:27:43Z
"Transient stability of a power system with superconducting fault current
  limiters","The influence of a superconducting fault current limiter (FCL) on the
transient stability of the synchronic operation of electric machines is
analyzed for different locations of the inductive FCL in a network and for
different parameters of the device. It is shown that the stability can be
improved or degraded depending on the FCL impedance under a fault and the time
of the recovery of the initial state of the limiter after a fault. Improving
the transient stability with the inductive superconducting FCL is demonstrated
in the experiments on the electrodynamic model of a power system. The expansion
of the obtained results for other FCL designs is discussed.",2007-01-14T14:03:06Z
Heisenberg exchange in magnetic monoxides,"The superexchange intertacion in transition-metal oxides, proposed initially
by Anderson in 1950, is treated using contemporary tight-binding theory and
existing parameters. We find also a direct exchange for nearest-neighbor metal
ions, larger by a factor of order five than the superexchange. This direct
exchange arises from Vddm coupling, rather than overlap of atomic charge
densities, a small overlap exchange contribution which we also estimate. For
FeO and CoO there is also an important negative contribution, related to Stoner
ferromagnetism, from the partially filled minority-spin band which broadens
when ionic spins are aligned. The corresponding J1 and J2 parameters are
calculated for MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO. They give good accounts of the Neel and
the Curie-Weiss temperatures, show appropriate trends, and give a reasonable
account of their volume dependences. For MnO the predicted value for the
magnetic susceptibility at the Neel temperature and the crystal distortion
arising from the antiferromagnetic transition were reasonably well given.
Application to CuO2 planes in the cuprates gives J=1220oK, compared to an
experimental 1500oK, and for LiCrO2 gives J1=4 50oK compared to an experimental
230oK.",2007-01-17T23:02:59Z
The finite tiling problem is undecidable in the hyperbolic plane,"In this paper, we consider the finite tiling problem which was proved

"A physics-based life prediction methodology for thermal barrier coating
  systems","A novel mechanistic approach is proposed for the prediction of the life of
thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems. The life prediction methodology is based
on a criterion linked directly to the dominant failure mechanism. It relies on
a statistical treatment of the TBC's morphological characteristics,
non-destructive stress measurements and on a continuum mechanics framework to
quantify the stresses that promote the nucleation and growth of microcracks
within the TBC. The last of these accounts for the effects of TBC constituents'
elasto-visco-plastic properties, the stiffening of the ceramic due to sintering
and the oxidation at the interface between the thermally insulating yttria
stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer and the metallic bond coat. The mechanistic
approach is used to investigate the effects on TBC life of the properties and
morphology of the top YSZ coating, metallic low-pressure plasma sprayed bond
coat and the thermally grown oxide. Its calibration is based on TBC damage
inferred from non-destructive fluorescence measurements using
piezo-spectroscopy and on the numerically predicted local TBC stresses
responsible for the initiation of such damage. The potential applicability of
the methodology to other types of TBC coatings and thermal loading conditions
is also discussed.",2007-03-02T16:15:58Z
"Pseudopotentials for Multi-particle Interactions in the Quantum Hall
  Regime","In fractional quantum Hall physics, the Hilbert space is projected to a
single Landau level and the entire Hamiltonian consists of just the projected
inter-electron interaction. Haldane's pseudopotential formalism has been an
extremely useful tool both for understanding these interactions, and for
understanding the quantum Hall states that result. In the current paper we
consider the analogue of this pseudopotential construction that results from
general M-body interactions rather than the usual (Coulomb) two-body

"Response of incompressible fractional quantum Hall states to magnetic
  and non-magnetic impurities","Using exact diagonalization we examine the response of several most prominent
fractional quantum Hall states to a single local impurity. The 2/3 singlet
state is found to be more inert than the polarized one in spite of its smaller
incompressibility gap. Based on its spin-spin correlation functions we
interpret it as a liquid of electron pairs with opposite spin. A comparison of
different types of impurities, non-magnetic and magnetic, is presented.",2007-03-05T01:41:47Z
"Protocols for optimal readout of qubits using a continuous quantum
  nondemolition measurement","We study how the spontaneous relaxation of a qubit affects a continuous
quantum non-demolition measurement of the initial state of the qubit. Given
some noisy measurement record $\Psi$, we seek an estimate of whether the qubit
was initially in the ground or excited state. We investigate four different
measurement protocols, three of which use a linear filter (with different
weighting factors) and a fourth which uses a full non-linear filter that gives
the theoretically optimal estimate of the initial state of the qubit. We find
that relaxation of the qubit at rate $1/T_1$ strongly influences the fidelity
of any measurement protocol. To avoid errors due to this decay, the measurement
must be completed in a time that decrease linearly with the desired fidelity
while maintaining an adequate signal to noise ratio. We find that for the
non-linear filter the predicted fidelity, as expected, is always better than
the linear filters and that the fidelity is a monotone increasing function of
the measurement time. For example, to achieve a fidelity of 90%, the box car
linear filter requires a signal to noise ratio of $\sim 30$ in a time $T_1$
whereas the non-linear filter only requires a signal to noise ratio of $\sim
18$.",2007-01-04T16:58:19Z
"Zero differential resistance state of two dimensional electron systems
  in strong magnetic fields","Zero differential resistance state is found in response to direct current
applied to 2D electron systems at strong magnetic field and low temperatures.
Transition to the state is accompanied by sharp dip of negative differential
resistance, which occurs above threshold value $I_{th}$ of the direct current.
The state depends significantly on the temperature and is not observable above
several Kelvins. Additional analysis shows lack of the linear stability of the
2D electron systems at $I>I_{th}$ and inhomogeneous, non-stationary pattern of
the electric current in the zero differential resistance state. We suggest that
the dc bias induced redistribution of the 2D electrons in energy space is the
dominant mechanism leading to the new electron state.",2007-03-04T00:37:40Z
"Transverse ultrasound absorption in cubic crystals with positive and
  negative anisotropies of second-order elasticity moduli","The transverse ultrasound absorption in cubic crystals with positive and
negative anisotropies of the second-order elasticity moduli is analyzed. The
scattering of the ultrasound by defects and during anharmonic scattering
processes is considered. The transverse ultrasound absorption is analyzed as a
function of the wave-vector direction in terms of the anisotropic continuum
model. The Landau-Rumer mechanism is considered for anharmonic scattering
processes. Known values of the second- and third-order elasticity moduli are
used to calculate parameters determining the ultrasound absorption. It is shown
that the angular dependences of the transverse ultrasound absorption differ
qualitatively if the anharmonic scattering processes dominate in cubic crystals
with positive and negative anisotropies of the second-order elasticity moduli.
For the scattering by defects and the anharmonic scattering processes, the
angular dependences of the transverse ultrasound absorption exhibit the inverse
behavior, making it possible to determine the dominating mechanism of the
ultrasound relaxation in the crystals under study.",2007-03-28T07:48:44Z
"Theory of the in-plane anisotropy of magnetic excitations in
  YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+y}","A pronounced xy-anisotropy was observed in recent neutron scattering
experiments for magnetic excitations in untwinned YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+y} (YBCO).
The small anisotropy of the bare band structure due to the orthorhombic crystal
symmetry seems to be enhanced by correlation effects. A natural possibility is
that the system is close to a Pomeranchuk instability associated with a d-wave
Fermi surface deformation (dFSD). We investigate this possibility in the
bilayer t-J model within a self-consistent slave-boson mean-field theory. We
show that the dFSD correlations drive a pronounced xy-anisotropy of magnetic
excitations at low doping and at relatively high temperatures, providing a
scenario for the observed xy-anisotropy in optimally doped as well as
underdoped YBCO, including the pseudogap phase.",2007-01-25T17:28:40Z
The structure of suspended graphene sheets,"The recent discovery of graphene has sparked significant interest, which has
so far been focused on the peculiar electronic structure of this material, in
which charge carriers mimic massless relativistic particle. However, the
structure of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a
honeycomb crystal lattice - is also puzzling. On the one hand, graphene appears
to be a strictly two-dimensional (2D) material and exhibits such a high crystal
quality that electrons can travel submicron distances without scattering. On
the other hand, perfect 2D crystals cannot exist in the free state, according
to both theory and experiment. This is often reconciled by the fact that all
graphene structures studied so far were an integral part of larger 3D
structures, either supported by a bulk substrate or embedded in a 3D matrix.
Here we report individual graphene sheets freely suspended on a microfabricated
scaffold in vacuum or air. These membranes are only one atom thick and still
display a long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) have revealed that suspended graphene sheets are not
perfectly flat but exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the
surface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1
nm. The atomically-thin single-crystal membranes offer an ample scope for
fundamental research and new technologies whereas the observed corrugations in
the third dimension may shed light on subtle reasons behind the stability of 2D
crystals.",2007-01-16T19:16:56Z
Clustering of solutions in hard satisfiability problems,"We study the structure of the solution space and behavior of local search
methods on random 3-SAT problems close to the SAT/UNSAT transition. Using the
overlap measure of similarity between different solutions found on the same
problem instance we show that the solution space is shrinking as a function of
alpha. We consider chains of satisfiability problems, where clauses are added
sequentially. In each such chain, the overlap distribution is first smooth, and
then develops a tiered structure, indicating that the solutions are found in
well separated clusters. On chains of not too large instances, all solutions
are eventually observed to be in only one small cluster before vanishing. This
condensation transition point is estimated to be alpha_c = 4.26. The transition
approximately obeys finite-size scaling with an apparent critical exponent of
about 1.7. We compare the solutions found by a local heuristic, ASAT, and the
Survey Propagation algorithm up to alpha_c.",2007-02-28T09:06:10Z
Bound State of Ultracold Fermions in the Spin Imbalanced Normal State,"We study a polarized Fermi gas and demonstrate that Fano-Feshbach (FF)
resonances lead to the pairing of fermions and holes into long living massive
bosonic modes (bifermions and biholes), which can be viewed as signatures of a
first order quantum phase transition. These modes, which are neither
conventional Cooper pairs nor closed channel bosonic dimers, have a peculiar
dispersion relation and appear already in the weak coupling limit, i.e. for
large FF detunings. Our result is in accord with claims of Schunck \emph{et
al.} [cond-mat/0702066] that by stabilizing the normal state the population
imbalance still allows effect of s-wave fermionic pairing.",2007-02-28T21:17:42Z
"A new mechanism for negative refraction and focusing using selective
  diffraction from surface corrugation","Refraction at a smooth interface is accompanied by momentum transfer normal
to the interface. We show that corrugating an initially smooth, totally
reflecting, non-metallic interface provides a momentum kick parallel to the
surface, which can be used to refract light negatively or positively. This new
mechanism of negative refraction is demonstrated by visible light and microwave
experiments on grisms (grating-prisms). Single-beam
all-angle-negative-refraction is achieved by incorporating a surface grating on
a flat multilayered material. This negative refraction mechanism is used to
create a new optical device, a grating lens. A plano-concave grating lens is
demonstrated to focus plane microwaves to a point image. These results show
that customized surface engineering can be used to achieve negative refraction
even though the bulk material has positive refractive index. The surface
periodicity provides a tunable parameter to control beam propagation leading to
novel optical and microwave devices.",2007-02-12T18:42:50Z
On The Capacity Of Time-Varying Channels With Periodic Feedback,"The capacity of time-varying channels with periodic feedback at the
transmitter is evaluated. It is assumed that the channel state information is
perfectly known at the receiver and is fed back to the transmitter at the
regular time-intervals. The system capacity is investigated in two cases: i)
finite state Markov channel, and ii) additive white Gaussian noise channel with
time-correlated fading. In the first case, it is shown that the capacity is
achievable by multiplexing multiple codebooks across the channel. In the second
case, the channel capacity and the optimal adaptive coding is obtained. It is
shown that the optimal adaptation can be achieved by a single Gaussian
codebook, while adaptively allocating the total power based on the side
information at the transmitter.",2007-03-28T18:46:52Z
Interpolation-based Decoding of Alternant Codes,"We formulate the classical decoding algorithm of alternant codes afresh based
on interpolation as in Sudan's list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, and thus
get rid of the key equation and the linear recurring sequences in the theory.
The result is a streamlined exposition of the decoding algorithm using a bit of
the theory of Groebner bases of modules.",2007-02-21T04:43:17Z
"An $L (1/3 + ε)$ Algorithm for the Discrete Logarithm Problem for
  Low Degree Curves","The discrete logarithm problem in Jacobians of curves of high genus $g$ over
finite fields $\FF_q$ is known to be computable with subexponential complexity
$L_{q^g}(1/2, O(1))$. We present an algorithm for a family of plane curves
whose degrees in $X$ and $Y$ are low with respect to the curve genus, and
suitably unbalanced. The finite base fields are arbitrary, but their sizes
should not grow too fast compared to the genus. For this family, the group
structure can be computed in subexponential time of $L_{q^g}(1/3, O(1))$, and a
discrete logarithm computation takes subexponential time of
$L_{q^g}(1/3+\epsilon, o(1))$ for any positive $\epsilon$. These runtime bounds
rely on heuristics similar to the ones used in the number field sieve or the
function field sieve algorithms.",2007-03-07T14:00:52Z
Patterns of technological progress: A Predictability-Based Perspective,"The paper tries to identify new emerging patterns in the context of
technological progress. Just as industrialization is associated with
rationalization, mechanization, and automation, the Internet age is associated
with computer models, embedded knowledge, and collaboration. Comparison among
patterns is highlighted and analysis is done from predictability-based
perspective.",2007-02-23T09:18:56Z
"Electrical transport and percolation in magnetoresistive manganite /
  insulating oxide composites: case of La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 / Mn3O4","We report the results of electrical resistivity measurements carried out on
well-sintered La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 / Mn3O4 composite samples with almost constant
composition of the magnetoresistive manganite phase (La0.7Ca0.3MnO3). A
percolation threshold (fc) occurs when the La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 volume fraction is ~
0.19. The dependence of the electrical resistivity as a function of
La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 volume fraction (fLCMO) can be described by percolation-like
phenomenological equations. Fitting the conducting regime (fLCMO > fc) by the
percolation power law returns a critical exponent t value of 2.0 +/- 0.2 at
room temperature and 2.6 +/-0.2 at 5 K. The increase of t is ascribed to the
influence of the grain boundaries on the electrical conduction process at low
temperature.",2007-03-14T11:09:46Z
Casimir force driven ratchets,"We explore the non-linear dynamics of two parallel periodically patterned
metal surfaces that are coupled by the zero-point fluctuations of the
electromagnetic field between them. The resulting Casimir force generates for
asymmetric patterns with a time-periodically driven surface-to-surface distance
a ratchet effect, allowing for directed lateral motion of the surfaces in
sizeable parameter ranges. It is crucial to take into account inertia effects
and hence chaotic dynamics which are described by Langevin dynamics. Multiple
velocity reversals occur as a function of driving, mean surface distance, and
effective damping. These transport properties are shown to be stable against
weak ambient noise.",2007-01-26T09:51:00Z
"Fluctuation effects in the theory of microphase separation of diblock
  copolymers in the presence of an electric field","We generalize the Fredrickson-Helfand theory of the microphase separation in
symmetric diblock copolymer melts by taking into account the influence of a
time-independent homogeneous electric field on the composition fluctuations
within the self-consistent Hartree approximation. We predict that electric
fields suppress composition fluctuations, and consequently weaken the
first-order transition. In the presence of an electric field the critical
temperature of the order-disorder transition is shifted towards its mean-field
value. The collective structure factor in the disordered phase becomes
anisotropic in the presence of the electric field. Fluctuational modulations of
the order parameter along the field direction are strongest suppressed. The
latter is in accordance with the parallel orientation of the lamellae in the
ordered state.",2007-02-19T13:47:44Z
"Vortex structures in few-electron quantum dots with spin degree of
  freedom","The vortex structures and formations of the few-electron states in quantum
dots without the Zeeman splitting are investigated. With spin degree of
freedom, it is noticed that both the choices of probe electron and the ways to
fix the other electrons in conditional single-particle wave functions affect
the display of the vortex structures and behaviors. Then the vortex transitions
in magnetic fields for the lowest states with different spins are studied. When
the field is not very strong, with the increase of the field, the vortex number
is monotone non-decreasing, and there are absent states although their angular
momenta are in accordance with transition rules given by the theory of electron
molecules. Different behaviors of the vortices with the change of interaction
range reveal the respective analogies to the vortices of electrons and
quasi-particles in fractional quantum Hall system. The separated vortices keep
apart from the electrons even when the interaction is screened and such
behavior can give an understanding of the absences of the angular momenta in
the transition sequences.",2007-01-31T05:26:00Z
Light Cone Structure near Null Infinity of the Kerr Metric,"Motivated by our attempt to understand the question of angular momentum of a
relativistic rotating source carried away by gravitational waves, in the
asymptotic regime near future null infinity of the Kerr metric, a family of
null hypersurfaces intersecting null infinity in shearfree (good) cuts are
constructed by means of asymptotic expansion of the eikonal equation. The
geometry of the null hypersurfaces as well asthe asymptotic structure of the
Kerr metric near null infinity are studied. To the lowest order in angular
momentum, the Bondi-Sachs form of the Kerr metric is worked out. The
Newman-Unti formalism is then further developed, with which the Newman-Penrose
constants of the Kerr metric are computed and shown to be zero. Possible
physical implications of the vanishing of the Newman-Penrose constants of the
Kerr metric are also briefly discussed.",2007-01-31T08:07:18Z
"The Characteristic Length Scale of the Magnetic Fluctuation in a Sunspot
  Penumbra: A Stochastic Polarized Radiative Transfer Approach","The characteristic size of penumbral structures are still below the current
resolution limit of modern solar telescopes. Though we have seen a significant
progress in theoretical work over the last decades no tight constraints can be
placed on the size of penumbral structures in order to favor models with
relatively large and thick magnetic flux elements, just at or below the current
resolution limit, or on the other hand, clusters of optically thin
micro-structures.
  Based on a macroscopic 2-component inversion and the approach of polarized
radiative transfer in stochastic media, we have estimated the characteristic
length scale of the magnetic fluctuation in a sunspot penumbra from observed
Stokes spectra. The results yield a coherent picture for the entire magnetic
neutral line of the penumbra and indicate that the magnetic fluctuations have a
typical length scale between 30 km and 70 km.",2007-03-13T17:21:30Z
Anisotropy and Order of Epitaxial Self-Assembled Quantum Dots,"Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) represent an important step in
the advancement of semiconductor fabrication at the nanoscale that will allow
breakthroughs in electronics and optoelectronics. In these applications, order
is a key factor. Here, the role of crystal anisotropy in promoting order during
early stages of SAQD formation is studied through a linear analysis of a
commonly used surface evolution model. Elastic anisotropy is used a specific
example. It is found that there are two relevant and predictable correlation
lengths. One of them is related to crystal anisotropy and is crucial for
determining SAQD order. Furthermore, if a wetting potential is included in the
model, it is found that SAQD order is enhanced when the deposited film is
allowed to evolve at heights near the critical surface height for
three-dimensional film growth.",2007-02-12T16:18:52Z
Generalized Gibbs canonical ensemble: A possible physical scenario,"After reviewing some fundamental results derived from the introduction of the
generalized Gibbs canonical ensemble, such as the called thermodynamic
uncertainty relation, it is described a physical scenario where such a
generalized ensemble naturally appears as a consequence of a modification of
the energetic interchange mechanism between the interest system and its
surrounding, which could be relevant within the framework of long-range
interacting systems.",2007-01-17T21:33:40Z
"X-Ray diffraction studies on asymmetrically broadened peaks of heavily
  deformed Zirconium based alloys","The diffraction peaks of Zircaloy-2 and Zr-2.5%Nb alloys at various
deformations are found to be asymmetric in nature. In order to characterize the
microstructure from these asymmetric peaks of these deformed alloys, X-Ray
Diffraction Line Profile Analysis like Williamson-Hall technique, Variance
method based on second and fourth order restricted moments and Stephens model
based on anisotropic strain distribution have been adopted. The domain size and
dislocation density have been evaluated as a function of deformation for both
these alloys. These techniques are useful where the dislocation structure is
highly inhomogeneous inside the matrix causing asymmetry in the line profile,
particularly for deformed polycrystalline materials.",2007-01-26T11:06:12Z
"Is Sharma-Mittal entropy really a step beyond Tsallis and Renyi
  entropies?","We studied the Sharma-Mittal relative entropy and showed that its physical
meaning is the free energy difference between the off-equilibrium and
equilibrium distributions. Unfortunately, Sharma-Mittal relative entropy may
acquire this physical interpretation only in the limiting case when both
parameters approach to 1 in which case it approaches Kullback-Leibler entropy.
We also note that this is exactly how R\'{e}nyi relative entropy behaves in the
thermostatistical framework thereby suggesting that Sharma-Mittal entropy must
be thought to be a step beyond not both Tsallis and R\'{e}nyi entropies but
rather only as a generalization of R\'{e}nyi entropy from a thermostatistical
point of view. Lastly, we note that neither of them conforms to the
Shore-Johnson theorem which is satisfied by Kullback-Leibler entropy and one of
the Tsallis relative entropies.",2007-03-11T23:46:20Z
A General Approach to Bosonization,"We summarize recent developments in the field of higher dimensional
bosonization made by the authors and collaborators and propose a general
formula for the field operator in terms of currents and densities in one
dimension using a new ingredient known as a `singular complex number'.
  Using this formalism, we compute the Green function of the homogeneous
electron gas in one spatial dimension with short-range interaction leading to
the Luttinger liquid and also with long-range interactions that leads to a
Wigner crystal whose momentum distribution computed recently exhibits essential
singularities.
  We generalize the formalism to finite temperature by combining with the
author's hydrodynamic approach. The one-particle Green function of this system
with essential singularities cannot be easily computed using the traditional
approach to bosonization which involves the introduction of momentum cutoffs,
hence the more general approach of the present formalism is proposed as a
suitable alternative.",2007-01-15T07:13:20Z
"Completeness - I. Revised, reviewed and revived","We have extended and improved the statistical test recently developed by
Rauzy for assessing the completeness in apparent magnitude of
magnitude-redshift surveys. Our improved test statistic retains the robust
properties -- specifically independence of the spatial distribution of galaxies
within a survey -- of the $T_c$ statistic introduced in Rauzy's seminal paper,
but now accounts for the presence of both a faint and bright apparent magnitude
limit. We demonstrate that a failure to include a bright magnitude limit can
significantly affect the performance of Rauzy's $T_c$ statistic. Moreover, we
have also introduced a new test statistic, $T_v$, defined in terms of the
cumulative distance distribution of galaxies within a redshift survey. These
test statistics represent powerful tools for identifying and characterising
systematic errors in magnitude-redshift data. We apply our completeness test to
three major redshift surveys: The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue (MGC), The Two
Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). We confirm that MGC and SDSS are complete up to the published (faint)
apparent magnitude limit Furthermore, we show that, unless a bright limit is
included for 2dFGRS, the data-set displays significant incompleteness at
magnitudes brighter than the published limit of $m_{b_{j}}=19.45$ mag.",2007-03-02T19:38:12Z
Temperature dependence of thermal conductivity in 1D nonlinear lattices,"We examine the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity of one
dimensional nonlinear (anharmonic) lattices with and without on-site potential.
It is found from computer simulation that the heat conductivity depends on
temperature via the strength of nonlinearity. Based on this correlation, we
make a conjecture in the effective phonon theory that the mean-free-path of the
effective phonon is inversely proportional to the strength of nonlinearity. We
demonstrate analytically and numerically that the temperature behavior of the
heat conductivity $\kappa\propto1/T$ is not universal for 1D harmonic lattices
with a small nonlinear perturbation. The computer simulations of temperature
dependence of heat conductivity in general 1D nonlinear lattices are in good
agreements with our theoretic predictions. Possible experimental test is
discussed.",2007-03-22T03:56:30Z
Optical conductivity of polaronic charge carriers,"The optical conductivity of charge carriers coupled to quantum phonons is
studied in the framework of the one-dimensional spinless Holstein model. For
one electron, variational diagonalisation yields exact results in the
thermodynamic limit, whereas at finite carrier density analytical
approximations based on previous work on single-particle spectral functions are
obtained. Particular emphasis is put on deviations from weak-coupling,
small-polaron or one-electron theories occurring at intermediate coupling
and/or finite carrier density. The analytical results are in surprisingly good
agreement with exact data, and exhibit the characteristic polaronic excitations
observed in experiments on manganites.",2007-03-23T11:22:27Z
"How to discriminate easily between Directed-percolation and Manna
  scaling","Here we compare critical properties of systems in the directed-percolation
(DP) universality class with those of absorbing-state phase transitions
occurring in the presence of a non-diffusive conserved field, i.e. transitions
in the so-called Manna or C-DP class. Even if it is clearly established that
these constitute two different universality classes, most of their universal
features (exponents, moment ratios, scaling functions,...) are very similar,
making it difficult to discriminate numerically between them. Nevertheless, as
illustrated here, the two classes behave in a rather different way upon
introducing a physical boundary or wall. Taking advantage of this, we propose a
simple and fast method to discriminate between these two universality classes.
This is particularly helpful in solving some existing discrepancies in
self-organized critical systems as sandpiles.",2007-03-08T12:06:49Z
"Commensurate-incommensurate transition and associated collective modes
  in the stripe state of cuprates near 1/8 hole-doping","We analyze the anomalous behavior in hole-doped cuprates near 1/8 doping in
terms of the commensurate-incommensurate transition of a stripe phase. Based on
an effective Ginzburg-Landau theory appropriate for weak pinning, we calculate
the commensurate-incommensurate transition point and the energies of the phason
and amplitudon collective modes. Using experimentally available parameters, we
estimate the phason gap (pinning frequency), the conductivity and the
contribution of the phason mode to the dielectric function.",2007-01-24T17:04:49Z
Quantum Magnetism and Superconductivity,"The spin of the neutron allows neutron scattering to reveal the magnetic
structure and dynamics of materials over nanometre length scales and picosecond
timescales. Neutron scattering is particularly in demand in order to understand
high-temperature superconductors, which lie close to magnetically ordered
phases, and highly correlated metals with giant effective fermion masses, which
lie close to magnetic order or pass through a mysterious phase of hidden order
before becoming superconducting. Neutron scattering also is the probe of choice
for revealing new phases of matter and new particles, as seen in the surprising
behaviour of quantum spin chains and ladders where mass gaps and excited
triplons replace conventional spin waves. Examples are given of quantum
phenomena where neutron scattering has played a defining role that challenges
current understanding of condensed matter.",2007-02-01T17:45:17Z
Pragmatic Space-Time Trellis Codes for Block Fading Channels,"A pragmatic approach for the construction of space-time codes over block
fading channels is investigated. The approach consists in using common
convolutional encoders and Viterbi decoders with suitable generators and rates,
thus greatly simplifying the implementation of space-time codes. For the design
of pragmatic space-time codes a methodology is proposed and applied, based on
the extension of the concept of generalized transfer function for convolutional
codes over block fading channels. Our search algorithm produces the
convolutional encoder generators of pragmatic space-time codes for various
number of states, number of antennas and fading rate. Finally it is shown that,
for the investigated cases, the performance of pragmatic space-time codes is
better than that of previously known space-time codes, confirming that they are
a valuable choice in terms of both implementation complexity and performance.",2007-03-28T13:50:00Z
"Ab initio calculations of third-order elastic constants and related
  properties for selected semiconductors","We present theoretical studies for the third-order elastic constants
$C_{ijk}$ in zinc-blende nitrides AlN, GaN, and InN. Our predictions for these
compounds are based on detailed ab initio calculations of strain-energy and
strain-stress relations in the framework of the density functional theory. To
judge the computational accuracy, we compare the ab initio calculated results
for $C_{ijk}$ with experimental data available for Si and GaAs. We also
underline the relation of the third-order elastic constants to other quantities
characterizing anharmonic behaviour of materials, such as pressure derivatives
of the second-order elastic constants and the mode Gr\""uneisen constants for
long-wavelength acoustic modes.",2007-01-17T13:23:11Z
Stability of longitudinal coupling for Josephson charge qubits,"For inductively coupled superconducting quantum bits, we determine the
conditions when the coupling commutes with the single-qubit terms. We show that
in certain parameter regimes such longitudinal coupling can be stabilized with
respect to variations of the circuit parameters. In addition, we analyze its
stability against fluctuations of the control fields.",2007-01-20T20:35:04Z
Interedge coherent line junctions in Quantum Hall systems,"In this paper we address some of the properties of quantum Hall line
junctions (QHLJ) that occur near barriers separating electron gases on quantum
Hall plateaus.In narrow barriers where electron tunneling can occur, the low
energy physics of the QHLJ is described by the quantum sine-Gordon model. We
propose procedures to study a sort of properties of these systems in relation
with recent experimental studies of Kang {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 403}, 59
(2000). We propose experimental ways of measuring the values of the
dimensionless coupling constant characteristic for the Sine-Gordon model as
well as its Fermi velocity. When the bulk filling of the 2DEG subsystems is
$\nu \sim 2$, these systems can be good candidates for observation of
spin-incoherent LL behavior.",2007-01-10T20:52:42Z
"User-level DSM System for Modern High-Performance Interconnection
  Networks","In this paper, we introduce a new user-level DSM system which has the ability
to directly interact with underlying interconnection networks. The DSM system
provides the application programmer a flexible API to program parallel
applications either using shared memory semantics over physically distributed
memory or to use an efficient remote memory demand paging technique. We also
introduce a new time slice based memory consistency protocol which is used by
the DSM system. We present preliminary results from our implementation on a
small Opteron Linux cluster interconnected over Myrinet.",2007-03-22T19:15:00Z
Studying Thermodynamics of Metastable States,"Simple classical thermodynamic approach to the general description of
metastable states is presented. It makes possible to calculate the explicit
dependence of the Gibbs free energy on temperature, to calculate the heat
capacity, the thermodynamic barrier, dividing metastable and more stable
states, and the thermal expansion coefficient. Thermodynamic stability under
mechanical loading is considered. The influence of the heating (cooling) rate
on the measured dynamic heat capacity is investigated. A phase shift of the
temperature oscillations of an ac heated sample is shown to be determined by
the relaxation time of the relaxation of the metastable nonequilibrium state
back to the metastable equilibrium one. This dependence allows one to calculate
the relaxation time. A general description of the metastable phase equilibrium
is proposed. Metastable states in AB3 alloys are considered. Reasons for the
change from the diffusional mechanism of the supercritical nucleus growth to
the martensitic one as the heating rate increases are discussed. The Ostwald
stage rule is derived.",2007-02-04T14:46:06Z
"Adaptive mesh computation of polycrystalline pattern formation using a
  renormalization-group reduction of the phase-field crystal model","We implement an adaptive mesh algorithm for calculating the space and time
dependence of the atomic density field during materials processing. Our
numerical approach uses the systematic renormalization-group formulation of the
phase field crystal model to provide the underlying equations for the complex
amplitude of the atomic density field--a quantity that is spatially uniform
except near topological defects, grain boundaries and other lattice
imperfections. Our algorithm is a hybrid formulation of the amplitude
equations, combining Cartesian and polar decompositions of the complex
amplitude. We show that this approach leads to an acceleration by three orders
of magnitude in model calculations of polycrystalline domain formation in two
dimensions.",2007-02-07T13:57:33Z
"Parallel Self-Consistent-Field Calculations via Chebyshev-Filtered
  Subspace Acceleration","Solving the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem constitutes the most computationally
expensive part in self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
In a previous paper, we have proposed a nonlinear Chebyshev-filtered subspace
iteration method, which avoids computing explicit eigenvectors except at the
first SCF iteration. The method may be viewed as an approach to solve the
original nonlinear Kohn-Sham equation by a nonlinear subspace iteration
technique, without emphasizing the intermediate linearized Kohn-Sham eigenvalue
problem. It reaches self-consistency within a similar number of SCF iterations
as eigensolver-based approaches. However, replacing the standard
diagonalization at each SCF iteration by a Chebyshev subspace filtering step
results in a significant speedup over methods based on standard
diagonalization. Here, we discuss an approach for implementing this method in
multi-processor, parallel environment. Numerical results are presented to show
that the method enables to perform a class of highly challenging DFT
calculations that were not feasible before.",2007-03-09T04:32:24Z
Local and regular plasma oscillations in bulk donor type semiconductors,"Restoring force acts on the electronic cloud of the outer electrons of a
neutral or charged impurity atom when it is shifted relative to the inner
charged core. Because of this the dipole oscillation arises, which influences
considerably the dispersion law of the plasma oscillation in bulk donor
semiconductors. Assuming that only one transition of the outer electron from
the ground state to the first excited state is essential, the dispersion law is
calculated. It is shown that calculated dispersion law consists of two separate
branches, one of them originates from the regular plasma oscillation of the
free electrons of a conductivity band, and the other one stems from the local
oscillation of the outer electrons bounded to the impurity atoms.",2007-02-08T12:14:20Z
Extragalactic Stellar Astronomy with Blue Supergiants,"The present generation of large telescopes facilitates spectroscopy of blue
supergiants in galaxies out to distances beyond the Local Group. Recent
developments in NLTE spectrum synthesis techniques allow for an accurate
determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances. Quantitative
analyses of blue supergiants in different galactic environments can provide
tight observational constraints on: I) the evolution of massive stars over a
wide range of metallicities, II) the chemical evolution of different galaxy
types, using stars as tracers of abundance gradients, III) the extragalactic
distance scale. The current status of the field is summarised.",2007-03-14T14:01:27Z
Microstructure and charge-ordering transitions in LuFe2O4,"Microstructure properties, phase transitions, and charge ordering in the
LuFe2O4 materials have been extensively investigated by means of transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The (001) twins as a common defect frequently appear
in the LuFe2O4 crystals along the c-axis direction, and the crystals across
each boundary are rotated by 180 degree with respect to one another. The
in-situ cooling TEM observations reveal remarkable temperature dependence of
the superstructures in correlation with charger ordering (CO). The Fe2+, Fe3+,
and Fe+2.5 ions are found to be crystallized in ordered stripes at the
frustrated ground state characterized by a modulation with the wave vector of
q1 =(1/3 1/3 2). In-situ heating TEM observations on LuFe2O4 clearly
demonstrate that this modulation becomes evidently invisible above a critical
temperature of about Tc=530K. These facts suggest that the CO should be the
essential driving force for the structural transitions and ferroelectricity
observed in present system.",2007-03-04T13:33:56Z
"Charge ordering and coexistence of charge fluctuations in
  quasi-two-dimensional organic conductors $θ$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$","We present a scenario for the peculiar coexistence of charge fluctuations
observed in quasi-2D 1/4-filled organic conductors $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$ in
the quantum critical regime where the charge ordering is suppressed down to
zero temperature. The scenario is explored in the extended Hubbard model
including electron-phonon couplings on an anisotropic triangular lattice. We
find that the coexisting fluctuations emerge from two different instabilities,
the ``Wigner crystallization on lattice'' driven by the off-site Coulomb
repulsion and the charge-density-wave formation due to the nesting of the Fermi
surface, not from phase competition or real-space inhomogeneity. This mechanism
explains the contrastive temperature dependence of two fluctuations in
experiments.",2007-02-28T14:28:10Z
"Low-temperature phase transformations of PZT in the morphotropic
  phase-boundary region","We present anelastic and dielectric spectroscopy measurements of
PbZr(1-x)Ti(x)O(3) with 0.455 < x < 0.53, which provide new information on the
low temperature phase transitions. The tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation
is first-order for x < 0.48 and causes a softening of the polycrystal Young's
modulus whose amplitude may exceed the one at the cubic-to-tetragonal
transformation; this is explainable in terms of linear coupling between shear
strain components and tilting angle of polarization in the monoclinic phase.
The transition involving rotations of the octahedra below 200 K is visible both
in the dielectric and anelastic losses, and it extends within the tetragonal
phase, as predicted by recent first-principle calculations.",2007-01-30T15:26:17Z
"Weak localization in a system with a barrier: Dephasing and weak Coulomb
  blockade","We non-perturbatively analyze the effect of electron-electron interactions on
weak localization (WL) in relatively short metallic conductors with a tunnel
barrier. We demonstrate that the main effect of interactions is electron
dephasing which persists down to T=0 and yields suppression of WL correction to
conductance below its non-interacting value. Our results may account for recent
observations of low temperature saturation of the electron decoherence time in
quantum dots.",2007-02-08T12:59:24Z
"Mott Transition and Strange Metal in Two Dimensions: A View from
  Cellular Dynamical Cluster Approximation","We introduce a Cellular Dynamical Cluster Approximation (CDCA) to study the
nature of the Mott insulator-metal transition in the extended Hubbard model on
a square lattice. At strong coupling, a d-wave Mott insulator is obtained. Hole
doping drives a first order Mott transition to a non-Fermi (nFL) liquid metal.
Remarkably, this nFL is caused by an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe at low
energies due to the non-trivial competition between strong, non-local
interactions and hopping. This constitutes the first explicit realisation of
Anderson's Luttinger liquid idea in two dimensions. Many experimental responses
in the ``strange metal'' phase found around optimal doping in cuprates are
understood naturally within our approach.",2007-01-24T10:24:39Z
Instabilities in the vortex matter and the peak effect phenomenon,"In single crystals of 2H-NbSe2, we identify for the first time a crossover
from weak collective to strong pinning regime in the vortex state which is not
associated with the peak effect phenomenon. Instead, we find the crossover is
associated with anomalous history dependent magnetization response. In the
field (Bdc) - temperature (T) vortex matter phase diagram we demarcate this
pinning crossover boundary. We also delineate another boundary which separates
the strong pinning region from a thermal fluctuation dominated regime, and find
that PE appears on this boundary.",2007-01-05T13:25:16Z
Far-Field Electron Spectroscopy of Nanoparticles,"A new type of excitations by highly focused electron beams in scanning
transmission electron microscopes is predicted for nanoparticles. The
calculated electron energy loss spectra of metallic (silver) and insulating
(SiO(sub2)) nanoplatelets reveal dramatic enhancement of radiative
electromagnetic modes within the light cone, allowed by the breakdown of
momentum conservation in the inelastic scattering event. These modes can be
accessed with e-beams in the vacuum far-field zone, similarly to the recently
developed far-field optics based on surface plasmon resonances.",2007-03-11T12:56:47Z
Non-equilibrium dynamics of spin facilitated glass models,"We consider the dynamics of spin facilitated models of glasses in the
non-equilibrium aging regime following a sudden quench from high to low
temperatures. We briefly review known results obtained for the broad class of
kinetically constrained models, and then present new results for the behaviour
of the one-spin facilitated Fredrickson-Andersen and East models in various
spatial dimensions. The time evolution of one-time quantities, such as the
energy density, and the detailed properties of two-time correlation and
response functions are studied using a combination of theoretical approaches,
including exact mappings of master operators and reductions to integrable
quantum spin chains, field theory and renormalization group, and independent
interval and timescale separation methods. The resulting analytical predictions
are confirmed by means of detailed numerical simulations. The models we
consider are characterized by trivial static properties, with no finite
temperature singularities, but they nevertheless display a surprising variety
of dynamic behaviour during aging, which can be directly related to the
existence and growth in time of dynamic lengthscales. Well-behaved
fluctuation-dissipation ratios can be defined for these models, and we study
their properties in detail. We confirm in particular the existence of negative
fluctuation-dissipation ratios for a large number of observables. Our results
suggest that well-defined violations of fluctuation-dissipation relations, of a
purely dynamic origin and unrelated to the thermodynamic concept of effective
temperatures, could in general be present in non-equilibrium glassy materials.",2007-03-06T19:32:59Z
Consequences of imperfect mixing in the Gray-Scott model,"We study an autocatalytic reaction-diffusion scheme, the Gray-Scott model,
when the mixing processes do not homogenize the reactants. Starting from the
master equation, we derive the resulting coupled, nonlinear, stochastic partial
differential equations that rigorously include the spatio-temporal fluctuations
resulting from the interplay between the reaction and mixing processes. The
fields are complex and depend on correlated complex noise terms. We implement a
novel method to solve for these complex fields numerically and extract accurate
information about the system evolution and stationary states under different
mixing regimes. Through this example, we show how the reaction induced
fluctuations interact with the temporal nonlinearities leading to results that
differ significantly from the mean-field (perfectly mixed) approach. This
procedure can be applied to an arbitrary non-linear reaction diffusion scheme.",2007-01-19T12:40:26Z
Hydrogen storage in pillared Li-dispersed boron carbide nanotubes,"Ab initio density-functional theory study suggests that pillared Li-dispersed
boron carbide nanotubes is capable of storing hydrogen with a mass density
higher than 6.0 weight% and a volumetric density higher than 45 g/L. The boron
substitution in carbon nanotube greatly enhances the binding energy of Li atom
to the nanotube, and this binding energy (~ 2.7 eV) is greater than the
cohesive energy of lithium metal (~1.7 eV), preventing lithium from aggregation
(or segregation) at high lithium doping concentration. The adsorption energy of
hydrogen on the Li-dispersed boron carbide nanotube is in the range of 10 ~24
kJ/mol, suitable for reversible H2 adsorption/desorption at room temperature
and near ambient pressure.",2007-03-20T15:38:50Z
"Effect of Static Disorder in an Electron Fabry-Perot Interferometer with
  Two Quantum Scattering Centers","In a recent paper -- F. Ciccarello \emph{et al.}, New J. Phys. \textbf{8},
214 (2006) -- we have demonstrated that the electron transmission properties of
a one-dimensional (1D) wire with two identical embedded spin-1/2 impurities can
be significantly affected by entanglement between the spins of the scattering
centers. Such effect is of particular interest in the control of transmission
of quantum information in nanostructures and can be used as a detection scheme
of maximally entangled states of two localized spins. In this letter, we relax
the constraint that the two magnetic impurities are equal and investigate how
the main results presented in the above paper are affected by a static disorder
in the exchange coupling constants of the impurities. Good robustness against
deviation from impurity symmetry is found for both the entanglement dependent
transmission and the maximally entangled states generation scheme.",2007-01-24T20:02:08Z
"Microscopic theory of thermal phase slips in clean narrow
  superconducting wires","We consider structure of a thermal phase-slip center for a simple microscopic
model of a clean one-dimensional superconductors in which superconductivity
occurs only within one conducting channel or several identical channels.
Surprisingly, the Eilenberger equations describing the saddle-point
configuration allow for exact analytical solution in the whole temperature and
current range. This solution allows us to derive a closed expression for the
free-energy barrier, which we use to compute its temperature and current
dependences.",2007-03-15T15:54:10Z
"Interplay between a quantum impurity and a boundary field in the SUSY
  t-J model","We study the role of bound states appearing in different formulations of the
Bethe ansatz for the supersymmetric t-J model with a boundary potential and an
integrable impurity. For special values of the parameters describing the
boundary and the impurity the charge fluctuations at the latter vanish. The
population of the bound states selects different sectors of the impurity levels
leading to integrable Kondo impurities.",2007-03-13T14:24:21Z
The Berry phase in ferromagnetic spin systems and anomalous Hall Effect,"We have shown that the study of topological aspects of the underlying
geometry in a ferromagnetic spin system gives rise to an intrinsic Berry phase.
This real space Berry phase arises due to the spin rotations of conducting
electrons which can be manifested as a further contribution in anomalous Hall
effect.",2007-01-18T10:09:34Z
"Concentration fluctuations of large Stokes number particles in a
  one-dimensional random velocity field","We analyze the behavior of an ensemble of inertial particles in a
one-dimensional smooth Gaussian velocity field, in the limit of large inertia,
but considering a finite correlation time for the random field. We derive in
this limit a perturbative scheme for the calculation of the concentration
correlation and of the particle relative velocity distribution, providing
analytical expressions for the concentration fluctuation amplitude, its
correlation length, and the modification in the particle pair relative velocity
variance. The amplitude of the concentration fluctuations is characterized by
slow decay at large inertia and a much larger correlation length than that of
the random field. The fluctuation structure in velocity space is very different
from predictions from short-time correlated random velocity fields, with only
few particle pairs crossing at sufficiently small relative velocity to produce
correlations. Concentration fluctuations are associated with depletion of the
relative velocity variance of colliding particles.",2007-02-13T17:01:18Z
Volume fluctuations and linear response in a simple model of compaction,"By means of a simple model system, the total volume fluctuations of a tapped
granular material in the steady state are studied. In the limit of a system
with a large number of particles, they are found to be Gaussian distributed,
and explicit expressions for the average and the variance are provided.
Experimental and molecular dynamics results are analyzed and qualitatively
compared with the model predictions. The relevance of considering open or
closed systems is discussed, as well as the meaning and properties of the
Edwards compactivity and the effective (configurational) temperature introduced
by some authors. Finally, the linear response to a change in the vibration
intensity is also investigated. A KWW decay of the volume response function is
clearly identified. This seems to confirm some kind of similarity between
externally excited granular systems and structural glasses.",2007-03-01T12:07:03Z
Halpha with Heating by Particle Beams,"Using 1D NLTE radiative hydrodynamics we model the influence of the particle
beams on the Halpha line profile treating the beam propagation and the
atmosphere evolution self-consistently. We focus on the influence of the
non-thermal collisional rates and the return current. Based on our results, we
propose a diagnostic method for determination of the particle beam presence in
the formation regions of the Halpha line.",2007-03-30T15:17:35Z
"Depth profile high-energy spectroscopic study of Mn-doped GaN prepared
  by thermal diffusion","We have performed an $in$-$situ$ depth profile study of Mn-doped GaN prepared
by a low temperature thermal diffusion method using photoemission and x-ray
absorption spectroscopy. It was revealed from the core-level photoemission
measurements that Mn ions are diffused into a deep ($\sim$ 70 \AA) region of
the GaN substrates and that the line shapes of Mn 3$d$ partial density of
states obtained by resonant photoemission measurements was close to that of
Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N thin films grown by molecular-beam epitaxy. From x-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
measurements at the Mn $L$-edge, it was revealed that the doped Mn ions were in
the divalent Mn$^{2+}$ state and primarily paramagnetic. In magnetization
measurements, weak hysteresis was detected in samples prepared using $p$-type
GaN substrates while samples using $n$-type GaN substrates showed only
paramagnetism.",2007-03-16T10:03:20Z
"Obscured and unobscured AGN populations in a hard-X-ray selected sample
  of the XMDS survey","Our goal is to probe the populations of obscured and unobscured AGN
investigating their optical-IR and X-ray properties as a function of X-ray
flux, luminosity and redshift within a hard X-ray selected sample of 136 X-ray
sources in the XMM Medium Deep Survey (XMDS) with wide multiwavelength
coverage. The XMDS area is covered with optical photometry from the VVDS and
CFHTLS surveys and infrared Spitzer data. Based on the X-ray luminosity and
X-ray to optical ratio, 132 sources are likely AGN, of which 122 have
unambiguous optical - IR identification. The observed optical and IR spectral
energy distributions of sources are fitted with AGN/galaxy templates in order
to classify them and compute photometric redshifts. 70% of the AGN are fitted
by a type 2 AGN or a star forming galaxy template and are grouped together in a
single class of ``optically obscured'' AGN. They have ``red'' optical colors
and generally show significant X-ray absorption from X-ray spectra or hardness
ratios (N$_H > 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$). Sources with SEDs typical of type 1 AGN
have ``blue'' optical colors and exhibit X-ray absorption in about 30% of
cases. We performed a stacking analysis for obscured and type 1 AGN. The
stacked X-ray spectrum of obscured AGN is flatter than that of type 1 AGN and
has an average spectral slope of Gamma = 1.6. The subsample of objects fitted
by a galaxy template has an even harder stacked spectrum, with Gamma = 1.2 -
1.3. The obscured fraction is larger at lower fluxes, lower redshifts and lower
luminosities. X-ray absorption is less common than ``optical'' obscuration and
its incidence is nearly constant with redshift and luminosity. This implies
that X-ray absorption is not necessarily related to optical obscuration.",2007-03-12T14:35:38Z
Nonlinear Electrokinetics at large applied voltages,"The classical theory of electrokinetic phenomena assumes a dilute solution of
point-like ions in chemical equilibrium with a surface whose double-layer
voltage is of order the thermal voltage, $k_BT/e = 25$ mV. In nonlinear
``induced-charge'' electrokinetic phenomena, such as AC electro-osmosis,
several Volts $\approx 100 k_BT/e$ are applied to the double layer, so the
theory breaks down and cannot explain many observed features. We argue that,
under such a large voltage, counterions ``condense'' near the surface, even for
dilute bulk solutions. Based on simple models, we predict that the double-layer
capacitance decreases and the electro-osmotic mobility saturates at large
voltages, due to steric repulsion and increased viscosity of the condensed
layer, respectively. The former suffices to explain observed high frequency
flow reversal in AC electro-osmosis; the latter leads to a salt concentration
dependence of induced-charge flows comparable to experiments, although a
complete theory is still lacking.",2007-03-01T20:56:32Z
"Charge mobility of discotic mesophases: A multiscale quantum/classical
  study","A correlation is established between the molecular structure and charge
mobility of discotic mesophases of hexabenzocoronene derivatives by combining
electronic structure calculations, Molecular Dynamics, and kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations. It is demonstrated that this multiscale approach can provide an
accurate ab-initio description of charge transport in organic materials.",2007-01-16T17:37:15Z
Neutrinos as cluster dark matter,"The dynamical mass of clusters of galaxies, calculated in terms of modified
Newtonian dynamics, is a factor of two or three times smaller than the
Newtonian dynamical mass but remains significantly larger than the observed
baryonic mass in the form of hot gas and stars in galaxies. Here I consider
further the suggestion that the undetected matter might be in the form of
cosmological neutrinos with mass on the order of 2 eV. If the neutrinos and
baryons have comparable velocity dispersions and if the two components maintain
their cosmological density ratio, then the electron density in the cores of
clusters should be proportional to temperature to the 3/2 power, as appears to
be true in non-cooling flow clusters. This is equivalent to the ``entropy
floor'' proposed to explain the steepness of the observed
luminosity-temperature relation, but here preheating of the medium is not
required. Two fluid (neutrino-baryon) hydrostatic models of clusters, in the
context of MOND, reproduce the observed luminosity-temperature relation of
clusters. If the beta law is imposed the gas density distribution, then the
self-consistent models predict the general form of the observed temperature
profile in both cooling and non-cooling flow clusters.",2007-03-22T17:22:33Z
Swift follow-up of the gigantic TeV outburst of PKS 2155-304 in 2006,"At the end of July 2006, the blazar PKS 2155-304 (z=0.116) underwent a strong
outburst observed at TeV energies by HESS (up to 17 Crab flux level at E > 200
GeV). The Swift satellite followed the evolution of the source for about one
month. The data analysis - reported in another paper - has shown that, despite
the violent activity at TeV energies, the synchrotron energy distribution
increased in normalization, but only with a small shift in frequency. In the
present work, we fit the broad-band spectrum with a log-parabolic model, to
search for indications of intrinsic curvature, which in turn is usually
interpreted as a signature of energy-dependent acceleration mechanisms of
electrons.",2007-03-30T08:36:59Z
"Interference induced metallic-like behavior of a two-dimensional hole
  gas in asymmetric GaAs/In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs quantum well","The temperature and magnetic field dependences of the conductivity of the
heterostructures with asymmetric In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As quantum well are studied.
It is shown that the metallic-like temperature dependence of the conductivity
observed in the structures investigated is quantitatively understandable within
the whole temperature range, $T=0.4-20$ K. It is caused by the interference
quantum correction at fast spin relaxation for 0.4 K$ < T < 1.5$ K. At higher
temperatures, 1.5 K$<T<4$ K, it is due to the interaction quantum correction.
Finally, at $T>4-6$ K, the metallic-like behavior is determined by the phonon
scattering.",2007-02-09T08:07:51Z
"On the checkerboard pattern and the autocorrelation of photoemission
  data in high temperature superconductors","In the pseudogap state the spectrum of the autocorrelation of angle resolved
photoemission (AC-ARPES) data of Bi2212 presents non-dispersive peaks in
momentum space which compare well with those responsible of the checkerboard
pattern found in the density of states by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. This
similarity suggests that the checkerboard pattern originates from peaks in the
joint density of states, as the dispersive peaks found in the superconducting
state do. Here we show that the experimental AC-ARPES spectrum can be
reproduced within a model for the pseudogap with no charge-ordering or symmetry
breaking. We predict that, because of the competition of superconductivity and
pseudogap, in the superconducting state, the AC-ARPES data of underdoped
cuprates will present both dispersive and non-dispersive peaks and they will be
better observed in cuprates with low critical temperature. We finally argue
that the AC-ARPES data is a complementary and convenient way to measure the arc
length.",2007-02-05T16:29:26Z
"Algorithms for 3D rigidity analysis and a first order percolation
  transition","A fast computer algorithm, the pebble game, has been used successfully to
study rigidity percolation on 2D elastic networks, as well as on a special
class of 3D networks, the bond-bending networks. Application of the pebble game
approach to general 3D networks has been hindered by the fact that the
underlying mathematical theory is, strictly speaking, invalid in this case. We
construct an approximate pebble game algorithm for general 3D networks, as well
as a slower but exact algorithm, the relaxation algorithm, that we use for
testing the new pebble game. Based on the results of these tests and additional
considerations, we argue that in the particular case of randomly diluted
central-force networks on BCC and FCC lattices, the pebble game is essentially
exact. Using the pebble game, we observe an extremely sharp jump in the largest
rigid cluster size in bond-diluted central-force networks in 3D, with the
percolating cluster appearing and taking up most of the network after a single
bond addition. This strongly suggests a first order rigidity percolation
transition, which is in contrast to the second order transitions found
previously for the 2D central-force and 3D bond-bending networks. While a first
order rigidity transition has been observed for Bethe lattices and networks
with ``chemical order'', this is the first time it has been seen for a regular
randomly diluted network. In the case of site dilution, the transition is also
first order for BCC, but results for FCC suggest a second order transition.
Even in bond-diluted lattices, while the transition appears massively first
order in the order parameter (the percolating cluster size), it is continuous
in the elastic moduli. This, and the apparent non-universality, make this phase
transition highly unusual.",2007-02-27T10:11:34Z
Evolution of transonicity in an accretion disc,"For inviscid, rotational accretion flows driven by a general pseudo-Newtonian
potential on to a Schwarzschild black hole, the only possible fixed points are
saddle points and centre-type points. For the specific choice of the Newtonian
potential, the flow has only two critical points, of which the outer one is a
saddle point while the inner one is a centre-type point. A restrictive upper
bound is imposed on the admissible range of values of the angular momentum of
sub-Keplerian flows through a saddle point. These flows are very unstable to
any deviation from a necessarily precise boundary condition. The difficulties
against the physical realisability of a solution passing through the saddle
point have been addressed through a temporal evolution of the flow, which gives
a non-perturbative mechanism for selecting a transonic solution passing through
the saddle point. An equation of motion for a real-time perturbation about the
stationary flows reveals a very close correspondence with the metric of an
acoustic black hole, which is also an indication of the primacy of
transonicity.",2007-03-11T16:46:04Z
"Multiscaling in the sequence of areas enclosed by coalescing random
  walkers","We address the question whether the sequence of areas between coalescing
random walkers displays multiscaling and in the process calculate the second
moment as well as the two point correlation function exactly. The scaling of
higher order correlation functions is estimated numerically, indicating a
logarithmic dependence on the system size. Together with the analytical
results, this confirms the presence of multiscaling.",2007-02-28T15:56:46Z
Cosmology in the Solar System: Pioneer effect is not cosmological,"Does the Solar System and, more generally, a gravitationally bound system
follow the cosmic expansion law ? Is there a cosmological influence on the
dynamics or optics in such systems ? The general relativity theory provides an
unique and unambiguous answer, as a solution of Einstein equations with a local
source in addition to the cosmic fluid, and obeying the correct (cosmological)
limiting conditions. This solution has no analytic expression. A Taylor
development of its metric allows a complete treatment of dynamics and optics in
gravitationally bound systems, up to the size of galaxy clusters, taking into
account both local and cosmological effects. In the solar System, this provides
an estimation of the (non zero) cosmological influence on the Pioneer probe: it
fails to account for the "" Pioneer effect "" by about 10 orders of magnitude. We
criticize contradictory claims on this topic.",2007-01-02T16:00:09Z
Left-handed Ferromagnet,"The dynamics of the total magnetization in metallic ferromagnet is studied
theoretically taking into account the relativistic spin-orbit interaction. It
is found that its quantum dynamics is seriously influenced by the band
crossings near the Fermi energy, and sometimes the direction of the precession
can be reversed from what expected from the commutation relation
$[S^{x},S^{y}]= i\hbar S^{z}$ ($h = 2\pi \hbar$: Planck constant), i.e., the
left-handed ferromagnet can be realized.",2007-02-16T07:45:23Z
"A geometric growth model interpolating between regular and small-world
  networks","We propose a geometric growth model which interpolates between
one-dimensional linear graphs and small-world networks. The model undergoes a
transition from large to small worlds. We study the topological characteristics
by both theoretical predictions and numerical simulations, which are in good
accordance with each other. Our geometrically growing model is a
complementarity for the static WS model.",2007-01-11T07:49:31Z
"Entropy, non-ergodicity and non-Gaussian behaviour in ballistic
  transport","Ballistic transportation introduces new challenges in the thermodynamic
properties of a gas of particles. For example, violation of mixing, ergodicity
and of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem may occur, since all these processes
are connected. In this work, we obtain results for all ranges of diffusion,
i.e., both for subdiffusion and superdiffusion, where the bath is such that it
gives origin to a colored noise. In this way we obtain the skewness and the
non-Gaussian factor for the probability distribution function of the dynamical
variable. We put particular emphasis on ballistic diffusion, and we demonstrate
that in this case, although the second law of thermodynamics is preserved, the
entropy does not reach a maximum and a non-Gaussian behavior occurs. This
implies the non-applicability of the central limit theorem.",2007-01-30T15:26:43Z
Landau-Zener transitions in the presence of spin environment,"We study the effect of an environment consisting of noninteracting two level
systems on Landau-Zener transitions with an interest on the performance of an
adiabatic quantum computer. We show that if the environment is initially at
zero temperature, it does not affect the transition probability. An excited
environment, however, will always increase the probability of making a
transition out of the ground state. For the case of equal intermediate gaps, we
find an analytical upper bound for the transition probability in the limit of
large number of environmental spins. We show that such an environment will only
suppress the probability of success for adiabatic quantum computation by at
most a factor close to 1/2.",2007-03-03T00:06:57Z
A new list of thorium and argon spectral lines in the visible,"Aims. We present a new list of thorium and argon emission lines in the
visible obtained by analyzing high-resolution (R=110,000) spectra of a ThAr
hollow cathode lamp. The aim of this new line list is to allow significant
improvements in the quality of wavelength calibration for medium- to
high-resolution astronomical spectrographs. Methods. We use a series of ThAr
lamp exposures obtained with the HARPS instrument (High Accuracy
Radial-velocity Planet Searcher) to detect previously unknown lines, perform a
systematic search for blended lines and correct individual wavelengths by
determining the systematic offset of each line relative to the average
wavelength solution. Results. We give updated wavelengths for more than 8400
lines over the spectral range 3785-6915 A. The typical internal uncertainty on
the line positions is estimated to be ~10 m/s (3.3 parts in 10^8 or 0.18 mA),
which is a factor of 2-10 better than the widely used Los Alamos Atlas of the
Thorium Spectrum (Palmer & Engleman 1983). The absolute accuracy of the global
wavelength scale is the same as in the Los Alamos Atlas. Using this new line
list on HARPS ThAr spectra, we are able to obtain a global wavelength
calibration which is precise at the 20 cm/s level (6.7 parts in 10^10 or 0.0037
mA). Conclusions. Several research fields in astronomy requiring high-precision
wavelength calibration in the visible (e.g. radial velocity planet searches,
variability of fundamental constants) should benefit from using the new line
list.",2007-03-15T19:13:43Z
New features in the phase diagram of TbMnO$_3$,"The (H,T)-phase diagram of the multiferroic perovskite TbMnO$_3$ was studied
by high-resolution thermal expansion $\alpha(T)$ and magnetostriction $\Delta
L(H)/L$ measurements. Below $T_{N}\simeq 42$ K, TbMnO$_3$ shows
antiferromagnetic order, which changes at $T_{FE}\simeq 28$ K where
simultaneously a spontaneous polarization $P||c$ develops. Sufficiently high
magnetic fields applied along $a$ or $b$ induce a polarization flop to $P||a$.
We find that all of these transitions are strongly coupled to the lattice
parameters. Thus, our data allow for a precise determination of the phase
boundaries and also yield information about their uniaxial pressure
dependencies. The strongly hysteretic phase boundary to the ferroelectric phase
with $P||a$ is derived in detail. Contrary to previous reports, we find that
even in high magnetic fields there are no direct transitions from this phase to
the paraelectric phase. We also determine the various phase boundaries in the
low-temperature region related to complex reordering transitions of the Tb
moments.",2007-01-19T20:35:22Z
"Skew scattering due to intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in a
  two-dimensional electron gas","We present the generalization of the two-dimensional quantum scattering
formalism to systems with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using symmetry
considerations, we show that the differential scattering cross section depends
on the spin state of the incident electron, and skew scattering may arise even
for central spin-independent scattering potentials. The skew scattering effect
is demonstrated by exact results of a simple hard wall impurity model. The
magnitude of the effect for short-range impurities is estimated using the first
Born approximation. The exact formalism we present can serve as a foundation
for further theoretical investigations.",2007-03-20T14:28:08Z
"Transverse Averaging Technique for Depletion Capacitance of Nonuniform
  PN-Junctions","This article evolves an analytical theory of nonuniform $PN$-junctions by
employing the transverse averaging technique (TAT) to reduce the
three-dimensional semiconductor equations to the quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) form involving all physical quantities as averaged over the
longitudinally-varying cross section $S(z)$. Solution of the quasi-1D Poisson's
equation shows that, besides the usual depletion capacitance $C_p$ and $C_n$
due to the $p$- and $n$-layers, there is an additional capacitance $C_s$
produced by nonuniformity of the cross-section area $S(z)$. The general
expressions derived yield the particular formulas obtained previously for the
abrupt and linearly-graded junctions with uniform cross-section. The quasi-1D
theory of nonuniform structures is demonstrated by applying the general
formulas to the $PN$-junctions of exponentially-varying cross section
$S(z)=S_0\exp(\alpha z)$ as most universal and applicable to any polynomial
approximation $S(z)\simeq S_0(1+\alpha z)^n$.",2007-01-23T14:02:20Z
"Controllable Josephson-Like Tunneling in Two-Component Bose-Einstein
  Condensates Coupled with Microwave via Feshbach Resonance and Trapping
  Potential","We put forward a scheme for controlling Josephson-like tunneling in
two-component Bose-Einstein condensates coupled with microwave field via
Feshbach resonance and tuning aspect ratio of trapping potential. We prove how
to realize a perfect periodic oscillation from a fast damped and irregular
oscillation on relative number of atoms in future experiment. In particular,
intensity of Josephson-like tunneling can be successfully controlled through
controlling speed of recovering the initial value of intra-atomic interaction
and aspect ratio of trapping potential. Interestingly, we find that relative
number of atoms represents two different types of oscillation in respond to
periodic modulation of attractive intra-atomic interaction.",2007-03-06T17:35:18Z
"The COSMOS Survey: Hubble Space Telescope / Advanced Camera for Surveys

for Surveys / Wide Field Channel (ACS/WFC) observations of the COSMOS field,
including the data calibration and processing procedures. We obtained a total
of 583 orbits of HST ACS/WFC imaging in the F814W filter, covering a field that
is 1.64 square degrees in area, the largest contiguous field ever imaged with
HST. The median exposure depth across the field is 2028 seconds (one HST
orbit), achieving a limiting point-source depth AB(F814W) = 27.2 (5 sigma). We
also present details about the astrometric image registration, distortion
removal and image combination using MultiDrizzle, as well as motivating the
choice of our final pixel scale (30 milliarcseconds per pixel), based on the
requirements for weak lensing science. The final set of images are publicly
available through the archive sites at IPAC and STScI, along with further
documentation on how they were produced.",2007-03-05T22:20:30Z
"The role of vacancies, impurities and crystal structure in the magnetic
  properties of TiO2","We present an ab initio study of pure and doped TiO2 in the rutile and
anatase phases. The main purpose of this work is to determine the role played
by different defects and different crystal structures in the appearance of
magnetic order. The calculations were performed for varying impurity and
vacancy concentrations in both TiO2 structures. For Co impurities the local
magnetic moment remained almost independent of the concentration and
distribution while for Cu this is not the case, there is magnetism for low
concentrations that disappears for the higher ones. Impurity-impurity
interactions in both structures favor linear ordering of them. Magnetism in
un-doped samples appears for certain vacancy concentrations and structural
strain.",2007-02-22T18:08:06Z
Existence of two electronic states in Sr4Ru3O10 at low temperatures,"We report measurements on in-plane resistivity, thermopower, and
magnetization as a function of temperature and magnetic fields on single
crystalline Sr4Ru3O10 grown by the floating zone method. As the temperature was
lowered to below around 30 K, the in-plane and c-axis resistivities and the
thermopower were found to exhibit a step feature accompanied by hysteresis
behavior when the in-plane field was swept up and down from below 10 kOe to
above 20 kOe. The sharp increase in the thermopower with increasing in-plane
magnetic field at low temperatures has not been observed previously in layered
transition metal oxides. Comparing with magnetization data, we propose that the
step feature marks the transition between the two different electronic states
in Sr4Ru3O10. We propose that the alignment of domains by the in-plane magnetic
field is responsible to the emergence of the new electronic states in high
applied in-plane magnetic field.",2007-02-05T08:17:16Z
Exact relaxation in a class of non-equilibrium quantum lattice systems,"A reasonable physical intuition in the study of interacting quantum systems
says that, independent of the initial state, the system will tend to
equilibrate. In this work we study a setting where relaxation to a steady state
is exact, namely for the Bose-Hubbard model where the system is quenched from a
Mott quantum phase to the strong superfluid regime. We find that the evolving
state locally relaxes to a steady state with maximum entropy constrained by
second moments, maximizing the entanglement, to a state which is different from
the thermal state of the new Hamiltonian. Remarkably, in the infinite system
limit this relaxation is true for all large times, and no time average is
necessary. For large but finite system size we give a time interval for which
the system locally ""looks relaxed"" up to a prescribed error. Our argument
includes a central limit theorem for harmonic systems and exploits the finite
speed of sound. Additionally, we show that for all periodic initial
configurations, reminiscent of charge density waves, the system relaxes
locally. We sketch experimentally accessible signatures in optical lattices as
well as implications for the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics.",2007-03-12T21:04:34Z
Mesoscopic phase statistics of diffuse ultrasound in dynamic matter,"Temporal fluctuations in the phase of waves transmitted through a dynamic,
strongly scattering, mesoscopic sample are investigated using ultrasonic waves,
and compared with theoretical predictions based on circular Gaussian
statistics. The fundamental role of phase in Diffusing Acoustic Wave
Spectroscopy is revealed, and phase statistics are also shown to provide a
sensitive and accurate way to probe scatterer motions at both short and long
time scales.",2007-01-25T17:15:38Z
Ground-layer wavefront reconstruction from multiple natural guide stars,"Observational tests of ground layer wavefront recovery have been made in open
loop using a constellation of four natural guide stars at the 1.55 m Kuiper
telescope in Arizona. Such tests explore the effectiveness of wide-field seeing
improvement by correction of low-lying atmospheric turbulence with ground-layer
adaptive optics (GLAO). The wavefronts from the four stars were measured
simultaneously on a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS). The WFS placed a 5 x
5 array of square subapertures across the pupil of the telescope, allowing for
wavefront reconstruction up to the fifth radial Zernike order. We find that the
wavefront aberration in each star can be roughly halved by subtracting the
average of the wavefronts from the other three stars. Wavefront correction on
this basis leads to a reduction in width of the seeing-limited stellar image by
up to a factor of 3, with image sharpening effective from the visible to near
infrared wavelengths over a field of at least 2 arc minutes. We conclude that
GLAO correction will be a valuable tool that can increase resolution and
spectrographic throughput across a broad range of seeing-limited observations.",2007-03-07T20:22:41Z
"Fully anisotropic superconducting transition in ion-irradiated
  YBa2Cu3O7-d with a tilted magnetic field","We consider the superconducting vortex solid-to-liquid transition in heavy
ion-irradiated untwinned YBa2Cu3O7-d single crystals in the case where the
magnetic field direction does not coincide with that of the irradiation-induced
linear columnar defects. For a certain range of angles, the resistivities
measured in three orthogonal spatial directions vanish at the transition as
three clearly different powers of reduced temperature. At previously known
second-order phase transitions, scaling of physical quantities has either been
isotropic or anisotropic in one direction. Thus, our findings yield evidence
for a new type of critical behavior with fully anisotropic critical exponents.",2007-03-08T17:42:43Z
Spin-polarization coupling in multiferroic transition-metal oxides,"A systematic microscopic theory of magnetically induced ferroelectricity and
lattice modulation is presented for all electron configurations of
Mott-insulating transition-metal oxides. Various mechanisms of polarization are
identified in terms of a strong-coupling perturbation theory. Especially, the
spin-orbit interaction acting on the ligand p orbitals is shown to give the
ferroelectric polarization of the spin-current form, which plays a crucial role
particularly in eg systems. Semiquantitative agreements with the multiferroic
TbMnO3 are obtained. Predictions for X-ray and neutron scattering experiments
are proposed to clarify the microscopic mechanism of the spin-polarization
coupling in different materials.",2007-01-25T11:42:47Z
Polaritons in cuprous oxide perturbed by LA-phonons,"We present a comparative analysis of a 'conventional' phonoriton (coherent
superposition of exciton-photon-phonon) and a polariton (coherent
exciton-photon superposition) 'weakly' coupled to the LA-phonons bath.
Depending on duration of the pumping laser field the phonon-induced decoherence
results in two distinct types of excitation. Long ($ms$) laser pumping pulses
form an 'equilibrium' polariton. The generic feature here is a pronounced
photo-thermal bi-stability. i.e. formation of four distinct branches.
Transitions between branches can be achieved by excitation energy fluctuations
as small as $200 neV$ which may impede BEC of the para-excitons. Short ($\mu
s$) laser pulses create a 'quasi-equilibrium' polariton. In the latter case,
for some critical intensity of the laser field we demonstrate possibility of
strong luminicence from a highly unstable localized state on the lower
polariton branch.",2007-03-25T15:37:50Z
"A lyotropic ferrocolloid (ferronematic) based on a potassium
  laurate/1-decanole/water ternary solution","A lyotropic ferrocolloid is synthesized by mixing of a cationic ferrofluid
and potassium laurate/1-decanol/water ternary solution. Conditions of existence
of a nematic phase in this mixture, other mesophases, and their phase diagrams
in the vicinity of the nematic one are obtained and characterized
quantitatively. Inside of the nematic zone the lyotropic ferrocolloid becomes a
ferronematic, i.e., a liquid crystal with remarkably strong magnetic
properties. We found that the pH and the component concentrations dramatically
affect the amount of magnetic particles stably suspended in a lyotropic
carrier. Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of synthesized ferronematics
are measured depending on the concentration of dispersed magnetic particles.",2007-03-21T04:47:54Z
Indexing the Sphere with the Hierarchical Triangular Mesh,"We describe a method to subdivide the surface of a sphere into spherical
triangles of similar, but not identical, shapes and sizes. The Hierarchical
Triangular Mesh (HTM) is a quad-tree that is particularly good at supporting
searches at different resolutions, from arc seconds to hemispheres. The
subdivision scheme is universal, providing the basis for addressing and for
fast lookups. The HTM provides the basis for an efficient geospatial indexing
scheme in relational databases where the data have an inherent location on
either the celestial sphere or the Earth. The HTM index is superior to
cartographical methods using coordinates with singularities at the poles. We
also describe a way to specify surface regions that efficiently represent
spherical query areas. This article presents the algorithms used to identify
the HTM triangles covering such regions.",2007-01-26T00:04:12Z
"Interchain-Frustration-Induced Metallic State in Quasi-One-Dimensional
  Mott Insulators","The mechanism that drives a metal-insulator transition in an undoped
quasi-one-dimensional Mott insulator is examined in the framework of the
Hubbard model with two different hoppings t_{perp 1} and t_{perp 2} between
nearest-neighbor chains. By applying an N_{perp}-chain renormalization group
method at the two-loop level, we show how a metallic state emerges when both
t_{perp 1} and t_{perp 2} exceed critical values. In the metallic phase, the
quasiparticle weight becomes finite and develops a strong momentum dependence.
We discuss the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the impact of our
theory in the understanding of recent experiments on half-filled molecular
conductors.",2007-01-29T09:49:35Z
"Phase diagram and Raman Imaging of Grain Growth Mechanisms in Highly
  Textured Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 Piezoelectric Ceramics","Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 solid solution (PMN(1-x)-PTx) ceramics with 0 <x<1
have been prepared by homo-epitaxial templated grain growth (HTGG) using cubic
PMN-PT single crystal seeds as templates and nanoparticles for thes ceramic
matrix. Samples were prepared using the doctor Blade method and sintered in a
controlled atmosphere. They were then analysed by DTA, TGA, optical/scanning
electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and imaging. Relationships between
Raman parameters such as band component or area versus composition (x) are
proposed. Wavenumber and peak area shifts from the single crystal seed centre
to periphery growth are assigned to compositional change. Representative medium
to highly textured ceramics with Lotgering factors of ~0.7 and 0.9 were
sintered at 1150 degrees C and 1200 degrees C, respectively, and studied by
direct and smart Raman imaging. The Raman peak centre of gravity depends on the
solid solution composition whereas peak intensity is correlated to the
unit-cell distorsion and related short-range structure. Two different growth
mechanisms are observed: below ~1200 degrees C, sharp corner and straight edged
single crystal seeds develop through a liquid I phase at the crystal/matrix
interface; at higher temperatures, the matrix is consumed and crystal growth
develops in contact with a liquid II phase, through the help of the high PbO
partial pressure. Smart Raman imaging shows that the final composition and
structure is very close to that of the matrix. Formation of short-range ordered
B/B' domains is expected. A phase diagram is proposed.",2007-01-15T21:01:39Z
Anomalous reflection and excitation of surface waves in metamaterials,"We consider reflection of electromagnetic waves from layered structures with
various dielectric and magnetic properties, including metamaterials. Assuming
periodic variations in the permittivity, we find that the reflection is in
general anomalous. In particular, we note that the specular reflection vanishes
and that the incident energy is totally reflected in the backward direction,
when the conditions for resonant excitation of leaking surface waves are
fulfilled.",2007-02-20T15:31:47Z
Rate-dependent slip boundary conditions for simple fluids,"The dynamic behavior of the slip length in a fluid flow confined between
atomically smooth surfaces is investigated using molecular dynamics
simulations. At weak wall-fluid interactions, the slip length increases
nonlinearly with the shear rate provided that the liquid/solid interface forms
incommensurable structures. A gradual transition to the linear rate-dependence
is observed upon increasing the wall-fluid interaction. We found that the slip
length can be well described by a function of a single variable that in turn
depends on the in-plane structure factor, contact density and temperature of
the first fluid layer near the solid wall. Extensive simulations show that this
formula is valid in a wide range of shear rates and wall-fluid interactions.",2007-02-20T20:34:38Z
"Polarization Screening Effect on Local Polarization Switching Mechanism
  and Hysteresis Loop Measurements in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy","Piezoresponse Force Spectroscopy (PFS) has emerged as a powerful tool for
probing polarization dynamics on the nanoscale. Application of a dc bias to a
nanoscale probe in contact with a ferroelectric surface results in the
nucleation and growth of a ferroelectric domain below the probe apex. The
latter affects local electromechanical response detected by the probe.
Resulting hysteresis loop contains information on local ferroelectric
switching. The self-consistent analysis of the PFS data requires (a) deriving
the thermodynamic parameters of domain nucleation and (b) establishing the
relationships between domain parameters and PFM signal. Here, we analyze the
effect of screening at the domain wall on local polarization reversal
mechanism. It is shown that the screening control both the domain nucleation
activation energy and hysteresis loop saturation rate.",2007-02-08T17:25:48Z
Resonance Microwave Absorption in He II.,"Microwave (MW) absorption in liquid 4He is investigated in the frequency
range of 40-200 GHz at T = 1.4 - 2.5 K. Whispering gallery of waves was
generated by a dielectric disc resonator immersed into the liquid. Resonance
absorption of MWs was detected at 180.3 GHz, which corresponds to the roton
minimum of the liquid helium excitation spectrum. The creation of a single
roton is possible because of the presence of the resonator wall which absorbs
an extra momentum. The resonance frequency is shown to decreases with
temperature in an excellent agreement with the temperature dependence of the
roton gap obtained previously in the neutron scattering experiment. The
temperature dependence of the MW absorption data indicates the anomalous
behavior near the lambda-point and displays the hysteretic character.",2007-03-27T11:59:31Z
"Gallium self-interstitial relaxation in Gallium Arsenide: an {ab initio}
  characterization","Ga interstitials in GaAs ($I_{Ga}$) are studied using the local-orbital
{ab-initio} code SIESTA in a supercell of {216+1} atoms. Starting from eight
different initial configurations, we find five metastable structures: the two
tetrahedral sites in addition to the 110-split$\mathrm{_{[Ga-As]}}$,
111-split$\mathrm{_{[Ga-As]}}$, and 100-split$\mathrm{_{[Ga-Ga]}}$. Studying
the competition between various configuration and charges of $I_{Ga}$, we find
that predominant gallium interstitials in GaAs are charged +1, neutral or at
most -1 depending on doping conditions and prefer to occupy the tetrahedral
configuration where it is surrounded by Ga atoms. Our results are in excellent
agreement with recent experimental results concerning the dominant charge of
$I_{Ga}$, underlining the importance of finite size effects in the calculation
of defects.",2007-01-25T16:44:50Z
Towards Practical Typechecking for Macro Tree Transducers,"Macro tree transducers (mtt) are an important model that both covers many
useful XML transformations and allows decidable exact typechecking. This paper
reports our first step toward an implementation of mtt typechecker that has a
practical efficiency. Our approach is to represent an input type obtained from
a backward inference as an alternating tree automaton, in a style similar to
Tozawa's XSLT0 typechecking. In this approach, typechecking reduces to checking
emptiness of an alternating tree automaton. We propose several optimizations
(Cartesian factorization, state partitioning) on the backward inference process
in order to produce much smaller alternating tree automata than the naive
algorithm, and we present our efficient algorithm for checking emptiness of
alternating tree automata, where we exploit the explicit representation of
alternation for local optimizations. Our preliminary experiments confirm that
our algorithm has a practical performance that can typecheck simple
transformations with respect to the full XHTML in a reasonable time.",2007-01-26T15:16:31Z
Pinning-controllability of complex networks,"We study the problem of controlling a general complex network towards an
assigned synchronous evolution, by means of a pinning control strategy. We
define the pinning-controllability of the network in terms of the spectral
properties of an extended network topology. The roles of the control and
coupling gains as well as of the number of pinned nodes are also discussed.",2007-01-04T10:55:24Z
"Reaction rate approach to dipolar relaxation in alkali halides:
  Adiabaticity versus classical, activated-tunneling, and quantal dipoles","This paper is aimed at presenting a simple vibronic model for describing the
dipolar reorientation in crystals by means of reaction rate theory. The
Hamiltonian of an isolated dipole is simplified so as to render the problem
solvable. Depending on the crossover splitting the dipoles may reorientate
adiabatically with a high electron-transfer expectancy or exhibit low
reorientation rates due to low expectancy. An important quantity to distinguish
between adiabatic dipoles behaving classically and ones reorientating by means
of quantum-mechanical tunneling is Christov's characteristic temperature which
is found to relate to the barrier height and crossover splitting. ITC data on
impurity-vacancy dipoles in Eu-doped alkali halides are reanalyzed.",2007-03-22T21:46:19Z
Dissipation Under the Magnetic Field on 2D Surface,"It is well known that the convection of liquid solution or melt liquid is
inhibited by the magnetic field experimentally, and so that we can make the
larger and better crystals at the cost of slow growth rate. We shall show here
another two effects due to the magnetic field. First, when the ionised molecule
diffuses on the surface of crystal under the magnetic field applied normal to
the surface,its diffusion constant decreases due to the magnetic effect.
Second, even if the molecule has no electric charge, if it has electric dipole
moment, the kinetic energy decreases by different mechanism.",2007-03-28T06:52:30Z
"Influence of cumulenic chains on the vibrational and electronic
  properties of sp/sp2 amorphous carbon","We report the production and characterization of a form of amorphous carbon
films with sp/sp2 hybridization (atomic fraction of sp hybridized species >
20%) where the predominant sp bonding appears to be (=C=C=)n cumulene.
Vibrational and electronic properties have been studied by in situ Raman
spectroscopy and electrical conductivity measurements. Cumulenic chains are
substantially stable for temperatures lower than 250 K and they influence the
electrical transport properties of the sp/sp2 carbon through a self-doping
mechanism by pinning the Fermi level closer to one of the mobility gap edges.
Upon heating above 250 K the cumulenic species decay to form graphitic
nanodomains embedded in the sp2 amorphous matrix thus reducing the activation
energy of the material. This is the first example of a pure carbon system where
the sp hybridization influences bulk properties.",2007-03-27T08:23:28Z
"Phase Sensitive Recombination of Two Bose-Einstein Condensates on an
  Atom Chip","The recombination of two split Bose-Einstein condensates on an atom chip is
shown to result in heating which depends on the relative phase of the two
condensates. This heating reduces the number of condensate atoms between 10 and
40% and provides a robust way to read out the phase of an atom interferometer
without the need for ballistic expansion. The heating may be caused by the
dissipation of dark solitons created during the merging of the condensates.",2007-02-28T23:30:31Z
"Supporting Finite Element Analysis with a Relational Database Backend,

typical use cases during grid building, (4) typical use cases during simulation
(get and put), (5) typical use cases during analysis (also done in Part III)
and some performance measures of these cases. It argues that using a database

"Mesoscopic Magnetic States in Metallic Alloys with Strong Electronic
  Correlations: A Percolative Scenario for CeNi$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$","We present evidence for the existence of magnetic clusters of approximately
20 \AA in the strongly correlated alloy system CeNi$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$ (0.7 $\le$
x $\le$ 0.2) based on small angle neutron scattering experiments as well as the
occurrence of staircase-like hysteresis cycles during very low temperature (100
mK) magnetization measurements. An unusual feature is the observation of
long-range ferromagnetic order below the cluster-glass transition without any
indication of a sharp transition at a Curie temperature. These observations
strongly support a phenomenological model where a percolative process connects
the cluster-glass state observed at high temperatures with the long-range
ferromagnetic order observed by neutron diffraction experiments at very low
temperatures. The model can account for all the puzzling macroscopic and
microscopic data previously obtained in this system, providing a new
perspective with regard to the magnetic ground state of other alloyed compounds
with small magnetic moments or weak ferromagnetism with intrinsic disorder
effects.",2007-03-15T08:31:39Z
Electron transport driven by a chemical potential difference,"Based on Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation coupled with Maxwell equation, we
investigate the spatial dependence of a chemical, an electrostatic and an
electrochmeical potentials inside a specimen connected with reservoirs. We also
confirm that a gap of the chemical potential between at a connection point is
negligible.",2007-02-02T09:01:46Z
"High shock release in ultrafast laser irradiated metals: Scenario for
  material ejection","We present one-dimensional numerical simulations describing the behavior of
solid matter exposed to subpicosecond near infrared pulsed laser radiation. We
point out to the role of strong isochoric heating as a mechanism for producing
highly non-equilibrium thermodynamic states. In the case of metals, the
conditions of material ejection from the surface are discussed in a
hydrodynamic context, allowing correlation of the thermodynamic features with
ablation mechanisms. A convenient synthetic representation of the thermodynamic
processes is presented, emphasizing different competitive pathways of material
ejection. Based on the study of the relaxation and cooling processes which
constrain the system to follow original thermodynamic paths, we establish that
the metal surface can exhibit several kinds of phase evolution which can result
in phase explosion or fragmentation. An estimation of the amount of material
exceeding the specific energy required for melting is reported for copper and
aluminum and a theoretical value of the limit-size of the recast material after
ultrashort laser irradiation is determined. Ablation by mechanical
fragmentation is also analysed and compared to experimental data for aluminum
subjected to high tensile pressures and ultrafast loading rates. Spallation is
expected to occur at the rear surface of the aluminum foils and a comparison
with simulation results can determine a spall strength value related to high
strain rates.",2007-03-19T10:03:47Z
"Revisiting the dynamical exponent equality $z=d$ for the dirty boson
  problem","It is shown that previous arguments leading to the equality $z=d$ ($d$ being
the spatial dimensionality) for the dynamical exponent describing the Bose
glass to superfluid transition may break down, as apparently seen in recent
simulations (Ref. \cite{Baranger}). The key observation is that the major
contribution to the compressibility, which remains finite through the
transition and was predicted to scale as $\kappa \sim |\delta|^{(d-z)\nu}$
(where $\delta$ is the deviation from criticality and $\nu$ is the correlation
length exponent) comes from the analytic part, not the singular part of the
free energy, and therefore is not restricted by any conventional scaling
hypothesis.",2007-03-14T19:19:18Z
"Excitons in QED3 and spin response in a phase-fluctuating d-wave

neutron scattering measurements in cuprates.",2007-01-30T00:17:56Z
"Coherence times of dressed states of a superconducting qubit under
  extreme driving","In this work, we measure longitudinal dressed states of a superconducting
qubit, the single Cooper-pair box, and an intense microwave field. The dressed
states represent the hybridization of the qubit and photon degrees of freedom,
and appear as avoided level crossings in the combined energy diagram. By
embedding the circuit in an rf oscillator, we directly probe the dressed
states. We measure their dressed gap as a function of photon number and
microwave amplitude, finding good agreement with theory. In addition, we
extract the relaxation and dephasing rates of these states.",2007-03-23T17:52:48Z
Theory of inelastic scattering from quantum impurities,"We use the framework set up recently to compute non-perturbatively inelastic
scattering from quantum impurities [G. Zar\'and {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 93}, 107204 (2004)] to study the the energy dependence of the single
particle $S$-matrix and the inelastic scattering cross section for a number of
quantum impurity models. We study the case of the spin $S=1/2$ two-channel
Kondo model, the Anderson model, and the usual $S=1/2$ single-channel Kondo
model. We discuss the difference between non-Fermi liquid and Fermi liquid
models and study how a cross-over between the non-Fermi liquid and Fermi liquid
regimes appears in case of channel anisotropy for the $S=1/2$ two-channel Kondo
model. We show that for the most elementary non-Fermi liquid system, the
two-channel Kondo model, half of the scattering remains inelastic even at the
Fermi energy. Details of the derivation of the reduction formulas and a simple
path integral approach to connect the $T$-matrix to local correlation functions
are also presented.",2007-03-12T12:41:50Z
"Gamma-Ray Burst Precursors as the Remnant of the Thermal Radiation
  Initially Trapped in the Fireball","In the standard fireball model of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the fireball
starts with an optically thick phase. As it expands, the fireball becomes
optically thin at some stage. The thermal radiation trapped in the originally
opaque fireball then leaks out, producing a transient event. The appearance of
the event is investigated in the framework of a homogeneous, spherically
symmetric, and freely expanding fireball produced instantly by an explosive
process without continuous injection of mass and energy. We find that,
generally, the event has a time-duration shorter than that of the main burst,
which is presumably produced by the internal shock after the fireball becomes
optically thin. The event is separated from the main burst by a quiescent
time-interval, and is weaker than the main burst at least in a high energy
band. Hence, the event corresponds to a GRB precursor. The precursor event
predicted by our model has a smooth and FRED (Fast Rise and Exponential Decay)
shape lightcurve, and a quasi-thermal spectrum. Typically, the characteristic
blackbody photon energy is in the X-ray band. However, if the distortion of the
blackbody spectrum by electron scattering is considered, the characteristic
photon energy could be boosted to the gamma-ray band. Our model may explain a
class of observed GRB precursors--those having smooth and FRED-shape
lightcurves and quasi-thermal spectra.",2007-03-07T13:26:02Z
Constructions of Grassmannian Simplices,"In this article an explicit method (relying on representation theory) to
construct packings in Grassmannian space is presented. Infinite families of
configurations having only one non-trivial set of principal angles are found
using 2-transitive groups. These packings are proved to reach the simplex bound
and are therefore optimal w.r.t. the chordal distance. The construction is
illustrated by an example on the symmetric group. Then some natural extends and
consequences of this situation are given.",2007-03-08T10:14:13Z
Limits of the upper critical field in dirty two-gap superconductors,"An overview of the theory of the upper critical field in dirty two-gap
superconductors, with a particular emphasis on MgB$_2$ is given. We focus here
on the maximum $H_{c2}$ which may be achieved by increasing intraband
scattering, and on the limitations imposed by weak interband scattering and
paramagnetic effects. In particular, we discuss recent experiments which have
recently demonstrated ten-fold increase of $H_{c2}$ in dirty carbon-doped films
as compared to single crystals, so that the $H_{c2}(0)$ parallel to the ab
planes may approach the BCS paramagnetic limit, $H_p[T] = 1.84T_c[K] \simeq
60-70T$. New effects produced by weak interband scattering in the two-gap
Ginzburg-Landau equations and $H_{c2}(T)$ in ultrathin MgB$_2$ films are
addressed.",2007-01-12T15:42:18Z
"Trapped fermionic clouds distorted from the trap shape due to many-body
  effects","We present a general approach for calculating densities and other local
quantities of trapped Fermi gases, when the cloud shape is distorted with
respect to the trap shape due to global energy considerations. Our approach
provides a consistent way to explore physics beyond the local density
approximation, if this is necessary due to the distortion. We illustrate this
by analyzing in detail experimentally observed distortions in an imbalanced
Fermi mixture in an elongated trap. In particular, we demonstrate in that case
dramatic deviations from ellipsoidal cloud shapes arising from the competition
between surface and bulk energies.",2007-01-18T22:14:54Z
"Dynamical diversity and metastability in a hindered granular column near
  jamming","Granular media jam into a panoply of metastable states. The way in which
these states are achieved depends on the nature of local and global constraints
on grains; here we investigate this issue by means of a non-equilibrium
stochastic model of a hindered granular column near its jamming limit. Grains
feel the constraints of grains above and below them differently, depending on
their position. A rich phase diagram with four dynamical phases (ballistic,
activated, logarithmic and glassy) is revealed. The statistics of the jamming
time and of the metastable states reached as attractors of the zero-temperature
dynamics is investigated in each of these phases. Of particular interest is the
glassy phase, where intermittency and a strong deviation from Edwards' flatness
are manifest.",2007-02-12T09:43:05Z
"Lamellar order, microphase structures and glassy phase in a field
  theoretic model for charged colloids","In this paper we present a detailed analytical study of the phase diagram and
of the structural properties of a field theoretic model with a short-range
attraction and a competing long-range screened repulsion. We provide a full
derivation and expanded discussion and digression on results previously
reported briefly in M. Tarzia and A. Coniglio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 075702
(2006). The model contains the essential features of the effective interaction
potential among charged colloids in polymeric solutions. We employ the
self-consistent Hartree approximation and a replica approach, and we show that
varying the parameters of the repulsive potential and the temperature yields a
phase coexistence, a lamellar and a glassy phase. Our results suggest that the
cluster phase observed in charged colloids might be the signature of an
underlying equilibrium lamellar phase, hidden on experimental time scales, and
emphasize that the formation of microphase structures may play a prominent role
in the process of colloidal gelation.",2007-01-23T17:57:07Z
Field Induced Supersolid Phase in Spin-One Heisenberg Models,"We use quantum Monte Carlo methods to demonstrate that the quantum phase

spectrum of a class of {\it isotropic} and {\it frustrated} spin systems. This
crucial result provides the required guidance for finding experimental
realizations of a spin supersolid state.",2007-02-13T21:03:42Z
"Thermal expansion and effect of pressure on superconductivity in

CuxTiSe2 samples corresponding to the parts of x - T phase diagram with
different ground states, as well as the pressure dependence of the
superconducting transition temperature for samples with three different values
of Cu-doping. Thermal expansion data suggest that the x - T phase diagram may
be more complex than initially reported. T_c data at elevated pressure can be
scaled to the ambient pressure CuxTiSe2 phase diagram, however, significantly

  underdoped superconductor La$_{1.895}$Sr$_{0.105}$CuO$_{4}$","High-resolution neutron inelastic scattering experiments in applied magnetic
fields have been performed on La$_{1.895}$Sr$_{0.105}$CuO$_{4}$ (LSCO). In zero
field, the temperature dependence of the low-energy peak intensity at the
incommensurate momentum-transfer $\mathbf{Q}^{\
}_{\mathrm{IC}}=(0.5,0.5\pm\delta,0),(0.5\pm\delta,0.5,0)$ exhibits an anomaly
at the superconducting $T^{\}_{c}$ which broadens and shifts to lower
temperature upon the application of a magnetic field along the c-axis. A
field-induced enhancement of the spectral weight is observed, but only at
finite energy transfers and in an intermediate temperature range. These
observations establish the opening of a strongly downward renormalized spin gap
in the underdoped regime of LSCO. This behavior contrasts with the observed
doping dependence of most electronic energy features.",2007-01-17T10:34:04Z
"Spin-charge rotating local reference frames: a unified U(2)=U(1)xSU(2)
  approach to the interacting electrons","A spin-charge unifying description for the Hubbard model based on the time
dependent local gauge transformations is developed. The collective variables
for charge and spin are isolated in the form of the space-time fluctuating U(1)
phase field and rotating spin quantization axis governed by the SU(2) symmetry,
respectively. As a result interacting electrons appear as a composite objects
consisting of bare fermions with attached U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. We
elaborate on the microscopic origins of the effective action with the Coulomb
interaction that contain topological theta terms. Furthermore, we unravel the
link between non-trivial multiply-connected topological structure of the
U(2)=U(1)$\otimes$SU(2) configurational space for gauge fields and the
instanton contribution to the statistical sum.",2007-01-09T10:15:23Z
Statistics of Deep Energy States in Coulomb Glasses,"We study the statistics of local energy minima in the configuration space and
the energy relaxation due to activated hopping in a system of interacting
electrons in a random environment. The distribution of the local minima is
exponential, which is in agreement with extreme value statistics
considerations. The relaxation of the system energy shows logarithmic time
dependence reflecting the ultrametric structure of the system.",2007-01-10T20:32:29Z
"Friction of the surface plasmon by high-energy particle-hole pairs: Are
  memory effects important?","We show that the dynamics of the surface plasmon in metallic nanoparticles
damped by its interaction with particle-hole excitations can be modelled by a
single degree of freedom coupled to an environment. In this approach, the fast
decrease of the dipole matrix elements that couple the plasmon to particle-hole
pairs with the energy of the excitation allows a separation of the Hilbert
space into low- and high-energy subspaces at a characteristic energy that we
estimate. A picture of the spectrum consisting of a collective excitation built
from low-energy excitations which interacts with high-energy particle-hole
states can be formalised. The high-energy excitations yield an approximate
description of a dissipative environment (or ""bath"") within a finite confined
system. Estimates for the relevant timescales establish the Markovian character
of the bath dynamics with respect to the surface plasmon evolution for
nanoparticles with a radius larger than about 1 nm.",2007-03-27T16:19:54Z
Equilibrium temperature anisotropy and black-hole analogues,"When long-range interactions are present the usual definition of temperature
implies that two systems in thermal equilibrium can be at different
temperatures. This local temperature has physical significance, if the
sub-systems cease to interact, each system will be at their different local
temperatures. This is formally related to redshifting of temperature in general
relativity. We propose experiments to test this effect which are feasible using
current microfabrication techniques. It is also possible to display
thermodynamical analogues to black-hole space-time.",2007-02-01T22:43:32Z
"Weak coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer suerconductivity in the
  Electron-Doped Cuprate Superconductors","We use in-plane tunneling spectroscopy to study the temperature dependence of
the local superconducting gap $\Delta(T)$ in electron-doped copper oxides with
various $T_c$'s and Ce-doping concentrations. We show that the temperature
dependence of $\Delta(T)$ follows the expectation of the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity, where
$\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\approx1.72\pm 0.15$ and $\Delta(0)$ is the average
superconducting gap across the Fermi surface, for all the doping levels
investigated. These results suggest that the electron-doped superconducting
copper oxides are weak coupling BCS superconductors.",2007-03-09T17:34:20Z
Phase diagram for interacting Bose gases,"We propose a new form of the inversion method in terms of a selfenergy
expansion to access the phase diagram of the Bose-Einstein transition. The
dependence of the critical temperature on the interaction parameter is
calculated. This is discussed with the help of a new condition for
Bose-Einstein condensation in interacting systems which follows from the pole
of the T-matrix in the same way as from the divergence of the medium-dependent
scattering length. A many-body approximation consisting of screened ladder
diagrams is proposed which describes the Monte Carlo data more appropriately.
The specific results are that a non-selfconsistent T-matrix leads to a linear
coefficient in leading order of 4.7, the screened ladder approximation to 2.3,
and the selfconsistent T-matrix due to the effective mass to a coefficient of
1.3 close to the Monte Carlo data.",2007-01-12T15:21:48Z
Coil-Stretch Transition and the Break Down of Continuum Models,"The breakdown of finite element (FEM) computations for the flow of an
Oldroyd-B fluid around a cylinder confined between parallel plates, at
Weissenberg numbers Wi = O(1), is shown to arise due to a coil-stretch
transition experienced by polymer molecules traveling along the centerline in
the wake of the cylinder. With increasing Wi, the coil-stretch transition leads
to an unbounded growth in the stress maximum in the cylinder wake. Finite
element computations for a FENE-P fluid reveal that, although polymer molecules
undergo a coil-stretch transition in the cylinder wake, the mean extension of
the molecules saturates to a value close to the fully extended length, leading
to bounded stresses with increasing Wi. The existence of a coil-stretch
transition has been deduced by examining the behavior of ultra-dilute Oldroyd-B
and FENE-P fluids. In this case, the solution along the centerline in the
cylinder wake can be obtained exactly since the velocity field is uncoupled
from the stress and conformation tensor fields. Estimation of the number of
finite elements required to achieve convergence reveals the in-feasibility of
obtaining solutions for the Oldroyd-B model for Wi > 1.",2007-03-12T07:36:57Z
"Color Intensity Projections: A simple way to display changes in
  astronomical images","To detect changes in repeated astronomical images of the same field of view
(FOV), a common practice is to stroboscopically switch between the images.
Using this method, objects that are changing in location or intensity between
images are easier to see because they are constantly changing. A novel display
method, called arrival time color intensity projections (CIPs), is presented
that combines any number of grayscale images into a single color image on a
pixel by pixel basis. Any values that are unchanged over the grayscale images
look the same in the color image. However, pixels that change over the
grayscale image have a color saturation that increases with the amount of
change and a hue that corresponds to the timing of the changes. Thus objects
moving in the grayscale images change from red to green to blue as they move
across the color image. Consequently, moving objects are easier to detect and
assess on the color image than on the grayscale images. A sequence of images of
a comet plunging into the sun taken by the SOHO satellite (NASA/ESA) and Hubble
Space Telescope images of a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) are used to
demonstrate the method.",2007-03-23T11:29:56Z
"Granular mixtures modeled as elastic hard spheres subject to a drag
  force","Granular gaseous mixtures under rapid flow conditions are usually modeled by
a multicomponent system of smooth inelastic hard spheres with constant
coefficients of normal restitution. In the low density regime an adequate
framework is provided by the set of coupled inelastic Boltzmann equations. Due
to the intricacy of the inelastic Boltzmann collision operator, in this paper
we propose a simpler model of elastic hard spheres subject to the action of an
effective drag force, which mimics the effect of dissipation present in the
original granular gas. The Navier--Stokes transport coefficients for a binary
mixture are obtained from the model by application of the Chapman--Enskog
method. The three coefficients associated with the mass flux are the same as
those obtained from the inelastic Boltzmann equation, while the remaining four
transport coefficients show a general good agreement, especially in the case of
the thermal conductivity. Finally, the approximate decomposition of the
inelastic Boltzmann collision operator is exploited to construct a model
kinetic equation for granular mixtures as a direct extension of a known kinetic
model for elastic collisions.",2007-01-23T16:55:44Z
Further Indications Against Jet Rotation in Young Stellar Objects,"I discuss recent observations of asymmetries in Doppler shifts across T Tauri
jets, and argue that the observed asymmetric velocity shifts and gradients do
not indicate jet rotation. These observations, therefor, cannot be used as a
support of a magnetized disk wind. The interaction of the jets with a
twisted-tilted (wrapped) accretion disk (or the variable velocity precessing
model) accounts better for the observations.",2007-03-18T06:26:24Z
"The structures and thermoelectric properties of the infinitely adaptive
  series (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n","The structures and thermoelectric properties of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n
homologous series, derived from stacking hexagonal Bi2 and Bi2Te3 blocks, are
reported. The end-members of this series are metallic Bi and semiconducting
Bi2Te3; nine members of the series have been studied. The structures form an
infinitely adaptive series and a unified structural description based on a
modulated structure approach is presented. The as-synthesized samples have
thermopowers (S) that vary from n-type for Bi2Te3 to p-type for phases rich in
Bi2 blocks but with some Bi2Te3 blocks present, to n-type again for Bi metal.
The thermoelectric power factor (S2/rho) is highest for Bi metal (43 muW/K2 cm
at 130 K), followed by Bi2Te3 (20 muW/K2 cm at 270 K), while Bi2Te (m:n = 5:2)
and Bi7Te3 (m:n = 15:6) have 9 muW/K2 cm (at 240 K) and 11 muW/K2 (at 270 K),
respectively. The results of doping studies with Sb and Se into Bi2Te are
reported.",2007-03-20T18:17:21Z
"Integer quantum Hall effect on a six valley hydrogen-passivated silicon
  (111) surface","We report magneto-transport studies of a two-dimensional electron system
formed in an inversion layer at the interface between a hydrogen-passivated
Si(111) surface and vacuum. Measurements in the integer quantum Hall regime
demonstrate the expected sixfold valley degeneracy for these surfaces is
broken, resulting in an unequal occupation of the six valleys and anisotropy in
the resistance. We hypothesize the misorientation of Si surface breaks the
valley states into three unequally spaced pairs, but the observation of odd
filling factors, is difficult to reconcile with non-interacting electron
theory.",2007-02-13T18:27:34Z
Effects of magnetic impurities on two-band superconductor,"I calculated the effect of magnetic impurities on the normal and
superconductive properties of a multiband s-wave superconductor by direct
solution of the two-band Eliashberg equations. In this way I determined the
critical temperature, the values of the superconductive gaps, the shape of the
superconductive density of states and other physical quantities that depend on
the concentration of magnetic impurities. I found that the gaps and the
penetration lengths display an unusual behaviour as a function of temperature.
I examine the possibility that the presence of a negative induced gap raises
the critical temperature.",2007-03-08T10:15:41Z
"Ab initio molecular dynamics study of manganese porphine hydration and
  interaction with nitric oxide","The authors use ab initio molecular dynamics and the density functional
theory+U (DFT+U) method to compute the hydration environment of the manganese
ion in manganese (II) and manganese (III) porphines (MnP) dispersed in liquid
water. These are intended as simple models for more complex water soluble
porphyrins, which have important physiological and electrochemical
applications. The manganese ion in Mn(II)P exhibits significant out-of-porphine
plane displacement and binds strongly to a single H2O molecule in liquid water.
The Mn in Mn(III)P is on average coplanar with the porphine plane and forms a
stable complex with two H2O molecules. The residence times of these water
molecules exceed 15 ps. The DFT+U method correctly predicts that water
displaces NO from Mn(III)P-NO, but yields an ambiguous spin state for the
MnP(II)-NO complex.",2007-01-23T18:26:07Z

"Layer-resolved imaging of domain wall interactions in magnetic tunnel
  junction-like trilayers","We have performed a layer-resolved, microscopic study of interactions between
domain walls in two magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic one, using
high-resolution x-ray photoemission electron microscopy. Domain walls in the
hard magnetic Co layer of a Co/Al2O3/FeNi trilayer with in-plane uniaxial
anisotropy strongly modify the local magnetization direction in the soft
magnetic FeNi layer. The stray fields associated to the domain walls lead to an
antiparallel coupling between the local Co and FeNi moments. For domain walls
parallel to the easy magnetization axis this interaction is limited to the
domain wall region itself. For strongly charged (head-on or tail-to-tail)
walls, the antiparallel coupling dominates the interaction over radial
distances up to several micrometers from the centre of the domain wall.",2007-02-27T09:52:46Z
"Spectroscopic fingerprints of the frustrated magnetic order in
  Li2VOSiO4: a t-J model study","We have analyzed theoretically the photoemission spectra of the insulating
compound Li2VOSiO4.Recently, this compound has been proposed as the first
experimental realization of the frustrated J1-J2 Heisenberg model. Although it
is well known that Li2VOSiO4 is magnetically ordered in a collinear arrangement
below TN=2.8 K, there is some controversy about the coexistence of two
collinear phases above TN. Using a generalized t-J model we have obtained a
complex spectral structure that can be traced back to the underlying collinear
magnetic structures. We discuss the possibility to use ARPES experiments as a
way to discern among the different scenarios proposed in the literature.",2007-03-08T18:32:59Z
"Two-magnon excitations in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering from
  quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets","We study two-magnon spectra in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS)
from the Heisenberg antiferromanets by extending the formula of Nomura
andIgarashi (Phys. Rev. B 71, 035110 (2005)). The core-hole potential in the
intermediate state of RIXS gives rise to a change in the exchange coupling
between 3d electrons, leading to an effective interaction between the core hole
and spins of 3d electrons. We derive a formula suitable to calculate the
two-magnon RIXS intensities, replacing the bare core-hole potential responsible
to charge excitations by this effective interaction creating two magnons in our
previous formula. It consists of two factors, one of which determines the
incident-photon-energy dependence and another is the two-magnon correlation
function. We evaluate the former factor for La_{2}CuO_{4} in terms of the
density of states of the 4p states obtained by the band calculation. We also
calculate the two-magnon correlation function as a function of energy loss
\omega and momentum transfer \textbf{q} of the Heisenberg model on a square
lattice,by summing up the ladder diagrams after transforming the magnon-magnon
interaction into a separable form. The calculated spectra form a broad peak
around \omega=3J for S=1/2 on the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary and vanish
at \textbf{q}=(0,0) and (\pi,\pi). Such momentum dependence of the RIXS spectra
could provide an excellent opportunity to study the dynamics in the Heisenberg
model.",2007-01-17T06:51:25Z
"The coronal structure of AB Dor determined from contemporaneous Doppler
  imaging and X-ray spectroscopy","We obtain contemporaneous observations of the surface and corona of AB Dor
using ground-based circularly polarised spectra from the Anglo-Australian
Telescope and X-ray data from the Chandra satellite. The ground-based data are
used to construct surface magnetic field maps, which are extrapolated to
produce detailed models of the quiescent corona. The X-ray data serve as a new
test for the validity of these coronal models.
  The high coronal density and complex multi-polar magnetic field indicate a
compact X-ray corona, which is concentrated close to the surface, with a
height, H~0.3-0.4R*. There is also significant correlation between the surface
and coronal active region locations. At this epoch AB Dor appears to possess
one very large active longitude region; displaying enhanced activity in the
form of large dark spots, strong magnetic fields and chromospheric emission.
  Finally, the level of rotational modulation and shape of the X-ray lightcurve
depend on the distribution of magnetic field in the obscured hemisphere. The
models that best reproduce the rotational modulation observed in the
contemporaneous Chandra X-ray lightcurve and spectra require the magnetic field
in the obscured hemisphere to be of the same polarity as that in the observed
hemisphere. The Sun shows different behaviour, with the leading polarity
reversed in the opposite hemisphere. The X-ray observations provide a unique
constraint on the magnetic structure in the obscured hemisphere.",2007-03-23T18:09:18Z
"Growing dynamical length, scaling and heterogeneities in the 3d
  Edwards-Anderson model","We study numerically spatio-temporal fluctuations during the
out-of-equilibrium relaxation of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.
We focus on two issues. (1) The evolution of a growing dynamical length scale
in the glassy phase of the model, and the consequent collapse of the
distribution of local coarse-grained correlations measured at different pairs
of times on a single function using {\it two} scaling parameters, the value of
the global correlation at the measuring times and the ratio of the coarse
graining length to the dynamical length scale (in the thermodynamic limit). (2)
The `triangular' relation between coarse-grained local correlations at three
pairs of times taken from the ordered instants $t_3 \leq t_2 \leq t_1$.
Property (1) is consistent with the conjecture that the development of
time-reparametrization invariance asymptotically is responsible for the main
dynamic fluctuations in aging glassy systems as well as with other mechanisms
proposed in the literature. Property (2), we stress, is a much stronger test of
the relevance of the time-reparametrization invariance scenario.",2007-01-05T18:59:08Z
Electron Transport through Nanosystems Driven by Coulomb Scattering,"Electron transmission through nanosystems is blocked if there are no states
connecting the left and the right reservoir. Electron-electron scattering can
lift this blockade and we show that this feature can be conveniently
implemented by considering a transport model based on many-particle states. We
discuss typical signatures of this phenomena, such as the presence of a current
signal for a finite bias window.",2007-03-12T08:11:33Z
Crystalline Surface Phases of the Liquid Au-Si Eutectic Alloy,"A two dimensional crystalline layer is found at the surface of the liquid
eutectic Au$_{82}$Si$_{18}$ alloy above its melting point $T_M=359 ^{\circ}$C.
Underlying this crystalline layer we find a layered structure, 6-7 atomic
layers thick. This surface layer undergoes a first-order solid-solid phase
transition occurring at $371 ^{\circ}$C. The crystalline phase observed for
T$>$371 $^{\circ}$C is stable up to at least 430 $^{\circ}$C. Grazing Incidence
X-ray Diffraction data at T$>$371 $^{\circ}$C imply lateral order comprising
two coexisting phases of different oblique unit cells, in stark contrast with
the single phase with a rectangular unit cell found for low-temperature
crystalline phase $359 ^{\circ}$C$<T<371 ^{\circ}$C.",2007-02-17T20:39:38Z
A proposal for measuring correlation functions in interacting gases,"We propose an experimental method that allows for scaling of all the diagonal
correlation functions (such as the density and pair correlation function)
during the expansion of harmonically trapped cold atomic gases with arbitrary
interactions even if the trapping is anisotropic. To do this we require that
the interaction be tunable by the use of a Feshbach resonance and that the
trapping potential can be manipulated independently along the axial and radial
directions. This permits a much greater accuracy and resolution in measurements
of correlation functions. We explain the explicit control procedure, outline
the scaling ansatz that we use and briefly discuss the systems where it could
be applied as well as possible experimental obstacles to its implementation.",2007-02-13T16:43:05Z
Group characterizable entropy functions,"This paper studies properties of entropy functions that are induced by groups
and subgroups. We showed that many information theoretic properties of those

Response to perturbations for granular flow in a hopper,"We experimentally investigate the response to perturbations of circular
symmetry for dense granular flow inside a three-dimensional right-conical
hopper. These experiments consist of particle tracking velocimetry for the flow
at the outer boundary of the hopper. We are able to test commonly used
constitutive relations and observe granular flow phenomena that we can model
numerically. Unperturbed conical hopper flow has been described as a radial
velocity field with no azimuthal component. Guided by numerical models based
upon continuum descriptions, we find experimental evidence for secondary,
azimuthal circulation in response to perturbation of the symmetry with respect
to gravity by tilting. For small perturbations we can discriminate between
constitutive relations, based upon the agreement between the numerical
predictions they produce and our experimental results. We find that the
secondary circulation can be suppressed as wall friction is varied, also in
agreement with numerical predictions. For large tilt angles we observe the
abrupt onset of circulation for parameters where circulation was previously
suppressed. Finally, we observe that for large tilt angles the fluctuations in
velocity grow, independent of the onset of circulation.",2007-01-02T16:25:06Z

Zero-bias anomaly in the tunneling density of states of graphene,"In the vicinity of the Fermi energy, the band structure of graphene is well
described by a Dirac equation. Impurities will generally induce both a scalar
potential as well as a (fictitious) gauge field acting on the Dirac fermions.
We show that the angular dependence of the zero-bias anomaly in the spatially
resolved tunneling density of states (TDOS) around a particular impurity allows
one to distinguish between these two contributions. Our predictions can be
tested in scanning-tunneling-microscopy measurements on graphene.",2007-02-01T15:07:49Z
"Effect of structure anisotropy on low temperature spin dynamics in
  quantum wells","Spin dynamics of two-dimensional electron gas confined in an asymmetrical
quantum well is studied theoretically in the regime where the scattering
frequency is comparable with the spin precession frequency due to the
conduction band spin splitting. The spin polarization is shown to demonstrate
quantum beats. If the spin splitting is determined by both bulk and structural
asymmetry mechanisms the beats are damped at zero temperature even in the
absence of a scattering. We calculate the decay of spin beats due to the
thermal broadening of the electron distribution function and electron
scattering. The magnetic field applied along the structure growth axis is shown
to increase the frequency of the beats and shift system towards the collision
dominated regime.",2007-02-07T18:33:24Z
Non-collinear coupling between magnetic adatoms in carbon nanotubes,"The long range character of the exchange coupling between localized magnetic
moments indirectly mediated by the conduction electrons of metallic hosts often
plays a significant role in determining the magnetic order of low-dimensional
structures. In addition to this indirect coupling, here we show that the direct
exchange interaction that arises when the moments are not too far apart may
induce a non-collinear magnetic order that cannot be characterized by a
Heisenberg-like interaction between the magnetic moments. We argue that this
effect can be manipulated to control the magnetization alignment of magnetic
dimers adsorbed to the walls of carbon nanotubes.",2007-02-28T23:38:44Z
First Order Phase Transition in a Model for Generalized Statistics,"A first order phase transition is found in a model which was introduced
originally by Murthy and Shankar [Phys. Rev. B 60, 6517 (1999)] to describe
systems of generalised exclusion statistics. I characterise the phase
transition in the canonical and grandcanonical ensebles for the case when the
statistical exclusion parameter is 1, which corresponds to the Fermi exclusion
statistics. We observe that in the grandcanonical ensemble the phase transition
has no latent heat, but it has a finite jump in the particle number. In
canonical conditions--when the particle number is held fix--the internal energy
is discontinuous at the transition.",2007-03-27T20:47:54Z
Conductivity of disordered graphene at half filling,"We study electron transport properties of a monoatomic graphite layer
(graphene) with different types of disorder at half filling. We show that the
transport properties of the system depend strongly on the symmetry of disorder.
We find that the localization is ineffective if the randomness preserves one of
the chiral symmetries of the clean Hamiltonian or does not mix valleys. We
obtain the exact value of minimal conductivity $4e^2/\pi h$ in the case of
chiral disorder. For long-range disorder (decoupled valleys), we derive the
effective field theory. In the case of smooth random potential, it is a
symplectic-class sigma model including a topological term with $\theta = \pi$.
As a consequence, the system is at a quantum critical point with a universal
value of the conductivity of the order of $e^2/h$. When the effective time
reversal symmetry is broken, the symmetry class becomes unitary, and the
conductivity acquires the value characteristic for the quantum Hall transition.",2007-02-26T20:53:09Z
Hyperfine Interaction in USb2 Crystal,"The hyperfine interactions at the uranium site in the antiferromagnetic USb2

surfaces in the hydrogen bonded superprotonic conductor Rb3H(SO4)2 are
extracted from the momentum distribution measured using Deep Inelastic Neutron

which accounts for the absence of the antiferroelectric transition seen in the
deuterated material, and a saddle point off the bond direction for tunneling
into the next well with a barrier height of 350 meV. The measured potential is
in qualitative agreement with phenomenological double Morse potentials that

Non-periodic pseudo-random numbers used in Monte Carlo calculations,"The generation of pseudo-random numbers is one of the interesting problems in
Monte Carlo simulations, mostly because the common computer generators produce
periodic numbers. We used simple pseudo-random numbers generated with the
simplest chaotic system, the logistic map, with excellent results. The numbers
generated in this way are non-periodic, which we demonstrated for 10$^{13}$
numbers, and they are obtained in a deterministic way, which allows to repeat
systematically any calculation. The Monte Carlo calculations are the ideal
field to apply these numbers, and we did it for simple and more elaborated
cases. Chemistry and Information Technology use this kind of simulations, and
the application of this numbers to Quantum Monte Carlo and Cryptography is
immediate. I present here the techniques to calculate, analyze and use these
pseudo-random numbers, show that they lack periodicity up to 10$^{13}$ numbers
and that they are not correlated.",2007-01-05T11:45:26Z
"Metal-insulator (fermion-boson)-crossover origin of pseudogap phase of
  cuprates I: anomalous heat conductivity, insulator resistivity boundary,
  nonlinear entropy","Among all experimental observations of cuprate physics, the
metal-insulator-crossover (MIC), seen in the pseudogap (PG) region of the
temperature-doping phase diagram of copper-oxides under a strong magnetic
field, when the superconductivity is suppressed, is most likely the most
intriguing one. Since it was expected that the PG-normal state for these
materials, as for conventional superconductors, is conducting. This MIC,
revealed in such phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz
ratio, insulator resistivity boundary, nonlinear entropy, resistivity
temperature upturn, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and
Fermi pockets, unambiguously indicates on the insulating normal state, from
which the high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) appears. In the present work
(article I), we discuss the MIC phenomena mentioned in the title of article.
The second work (article II) will be devoted to discussion of other listed
above MIC phenomena and also to interpretation of the recent observations in
the hidden magnetic order and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments
spin and charge fluctuations as the intra PG and HTS pair ones. We find that
all these MIC (called in the literature as non-Fermi liquid) phenomena can be
obtained within the Coulomb single boson and single fermion two liquid model,
which we recently developed, and the MIC is a crossover of single fermions into
those of single bosons. We show that this MIC originates from bosons of Coulomb
two liquid model and fermions, whose origin is these bosons. At an increase of
doping up to critical value or temperature up to PG boundary temperature, the
boson system undegoes bosonic insulator - bosonic metal - fermionic metal
transitions.",2007-03-12T11:03:31Z
"Nonintegrability and fluctuation by symmetry violation in perturbed
  harmonic oscillator systems","The violation of symmetry between the time series of elongation and
contraction rates of phase-space point spacings is studied to examine the chaos
in perturbed harmonic oscillator systems. A transition from integrability to
nonintegrability is quantitatively evaluated by introducing a correlation
coefficient for the degree of symmetry violation. A feature of the correlation
coefficient is discussed, suggesting a possible advantage over the Lyapunov
exponent. The relationship between a fluctuation property based on symmetry

Critical relations in symmetric $0-π$ Josephson junctions,"Numerical modeling of dependences ``critical current -- external magnetic

The calculation of critical current is reduced to non-linear eigenvalue
problem. The critical curve of the contact is obtained as an envelope of the
bifurcation curves of different distributions of the magnetic flux. The
structure of vortices in contact is observed explicitly and the dependence of
the basic physical characteristics of these vortices on junction's length is

good qualitative and quantitative conformity.",2007-02-18T09:26:35Z
Studying the first galaxies with ALMA,"We discuss observations of the first galaxies, within cosmic reionization, at
centimeter and millimeter wavelengths. We present a summary of current
observations of the host galaxies of the most distant QSOs ($z \sim 6$). These
observations reveal the gas, dust, and star formation in the host galaxies on
kpc-scales. These data imply an enriched ISM in the QSO host galaxies within 1
Gyr of the big bang, and are consistent with models of coeval supermassive
black hole and spheroidal galaxy formation in major mergers at high redshift.
Current instruments are limited to studying truly pathologic objects at these
redshifts, meaning hyper-luminous infrared galaxies ($L_{FIR} \sim 10^{13}$
L$_\odot$). ALMA will provide the one to two orders of magnitude improvement in
millimeter astronomy required to study normal star forming galaxies (ie.
Ly-$\alpha$ emitters) at $z \sim 6$. ALMA will reveal, at sub-kpc spatial
resolution, the thermal gas and dust -- the fundamental fuel for star formation
-- in galaxies into cosmic reionization.",2007-03-30T15:12:01Z
"On the gravitational radiation from the collapse of neutron stars to
  rotating black holes","We provide details and present additional results on the numerical study of
the gravitational-wave emission from the collapse of neutron stars to rotating
black holes in three dimensions. More specifically, we concentrate on the
advantages and disadvantages of the use of the excision technique and on how
alternative approaches to that of excision can be successfully employed.
Furthermore, as a first step towards source-characterization, we present a
systematic discussion of the influence that rotation and different
perturbations have on the waveforms and hence on the energy emitted in
gravitational waves.",2007-01-06T17:22:29Z
Kohn anomalies and non-adiabaticity in doped carbon nanotubes,"The high-frequency Raman-active phonon modes of metallic single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNTs) are thought to be characterized by Kohn anomalies (KAs),
which are expected to be modified by the doping-induced tuning of the Fermi
energy level $\epsilon_F$, obtained through the intercalation of SWNTs with
alkali atoms or by the application of a gate potential. We present a
Density-Functional Theory (DFT) study of the phonon properties of a (9,9)
metallic SWNT as a function of electronic doping. For such study, we use, as in
standard DFT calculations of vibrational properties, the Born-Oppenheimer (BO)
approximation. We also develop an analytical model capable of reproducing and
interpreting our DFT results. Both DFT calculations and this model predict, for
increasing doping levels, a series of EPC-induced KAs in the vibrational mode
parallel to the tube axis at the $\mathbf\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone,
usually indicated in Raman spectroscopy as the $G^-$ peak. Such KAs would arise
each time a new conduction band is populated. However, we show that they are an
artifact of the BO approximation. The inclusion of non-adiabatic (NA) effects
dramatically affects the results, predicting KAs at $\mathbf\Gamma$ only when
$\epsilon_F$ is close to a band crossing $E_{X}$. For each band crossing a
double KA occurs for $\epsilon_F=E_{X}\pm \hbar\omega/2$, where $\hbar\omega$
is the phonon energy. In particular, for a 1.2 $nm$ metallic nanotube, we
predict a KA to occur in the so-called $G^-$ peak at a doping level of about
$N_{el}/C=\pm 0.0015$ atom ($\epsilon_F\approx \pm 0.1 ~eV$). Furthermore, we
predict that the Raman linewidth of the $G^-$ peak significantly decreases for
$|\epsilon_F| \geq \hbar\omega/2$.",2007-02-21T14:37:20Z
"Structure and dynamics of l-Ge: Neutron scattering experiments and ab
  initio molecular dynamics simulations","We report the first measurements of the dynamics of liquid germanium (l-Ge)
by quasi-elastic neutron scattering on time-of-flight and triple-axis
spectrometers. These results are compared with simulation data of the structure
and dynamics of l-Ge which have been obtained with ab initio density functional
theory methods. The simulations accurately reproduce previous results from
elastic and inelastic scattering experiments, as well as the q-dependence of
the width of the quasi-elastic signal of the new experimental data. In order to
understand some special features of the structure of the liquid we have also
simulated amorphous Ge. Overall we find that the atomistic model represents
accurately the average structure of real l-Ge as well as the time dependent
structural fluctuations. The new quasi-elastic neutron scattering data allows
us to investigate to what extent simple theoretical models can be used to
describe diffusion in l-Ge.",2007-03-14T08:41:39Z
Water on Pt(111): the importance of proton disorder,"The structure of a water adlayer on Pt(111) surface is investigated by
extensive first principle calculations. Only allowing for proton disorder the
ground state energy can be found. This results from an interplay between
water/metal chemical bonding and the hydrogen bonding of the water network. The
resulting short O-Pt distance accounts for experimental evidences. The novelty
of these results shed a new light on relevant aspects of water-metal
interaction.",2007-01-23T11:47:22Z
"Electronics and Chemistry: Varying Single Molecule Junction Conductance
  Using Chemical Substituents","We measure the low bias conductance of a series of substituted benzene
diamine molecules while breaking a gold point contact in a solution of the
molecules. Transport through these substituted benzenes is by means of
nonresonant tunneling or superexchange, with the molecular junction conductance
depending on the alignment of the metal Fermi level to the closest molecular
level. Electron-donating substituents, which drive the occupied molecular
orbitals up, increase the junction conductance, while electron-withdrawing
substituents have the opposite effect. Thus for the measured series,
conductance varies inversely with the calculated ionization potential of the
molecules. These results reveal that the occupied states are closest to the
gold Fermi energy, indicating that the tunneling transport through these
molecules is analogous to hole tunneling through an insulating film.",2007-03-16T18:07:53Z
"Localization of particles in harmonic confinement: Effect of the
  interparticle interaction","We study the localization of particles rotating in a two-dimensional harmonic
potential by solving their rotational spectrum using many-particle quantum
mechanics and comparing the result to that obtained with quantizing the rigid
rotation and vibrational modes of localized particles. We show that for a small
number of particles the localization is similar for bosons and fermions.
Moreover, independent of the range of the interaction the quantum mechanical
spectrum at large angular momenta can be understood by vibrational modes of
localized particles.",2007-03-02T08:23:48Z
Diffuse Ionized Gas inside the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822,"We have studied the differences between the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) and the
HII regions along a slit position in the local dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822.
The slit position passes through the two most prominent HII regions: Hubble V
and Hubble X. Important differences have been found in the excitation,
ionization, and [NII]6584/Ha and [SII]6717/Ha line ratios between the DIG and
the HII locations. Moreover, the values of all the line ratios are not similar
to those in the DIG locations of spiral galaxies but are very similar to the
values in other irregular galaxies, such as IC 10. We also determined the rate
of recombination using the HeI5875 line. Finally, we obtained a picture of the
ionization sources of the DIG. We consider that the leakage of photons from the
HII regions might explain most of the line ratios, except [NII]/Ha, which might
be explained by turbulence.",2007-03-05T17:05:26Z
"Simulations of partially coherent focal plane imaging arrays: Fisher
  matrix approach to performance evaluation","Focal plane arrays of bolometers are increasingly employed in astronomy at
far--infrared to millimetre wavelengths. The focal plane fields and the
detectors are both partially coherent in these systems, but no account has
previously been taken of the effect of partial coherence on array performance.
In this paper, we use our recently developed coupled--mode theory of detection
together with Fisher information matrix techniques from signal processing to
characterize the behaviour of partially coherent imaging arrays. We investigate
the effects of the size and coherence length of both the source and the
detectors, and the packing density of the array, on the amount of information
that can be extracted from observations with such arrays.",2007-03-07T10:49:34Z
Experimental study of work fluctuations in a harmonic oscillator,"The work fluctuations of a harmonic oscillator in contact with a thermostat
and driven out of equilibrium by an external force are studied experimentally.
For the work both the transient and stationary state fluctuation theorems hold.
The finite time corrections are very different from those of a first order
Langevin equation. The heat and work fluctuations are studied when a periodic
forcing is applied to the oscillator. The importance of the choice of the
''good work'' to compute the free energy from the Jarzinsky equality is
discussed.",2007-03-27T06:52:04Z
Flow-optimized Cooperative Transmission for the Relay Channel,"This paper describes an approach for half-duplex cooperative transmission in
a classical three-node relay channel. Assuming availability of channel state
information at nodes, the approach makes use of this information to optimize
distinct flows through the direct link from the source to the destination and
the path via the relay, respectively. It is shown that such a design can
effectively harness diversity advantage of the relay channel in both high-rate
and low-rate scenarios. When the rate requirement is low, the proposed design
gives a second-order outage diversity performance approaching that of
full-duplex relaying. When the rate requirement becomes asymptotically large,
the design still gives a close-to-second-order outage diversity performance.
The design also achieves the best diversity-multiplexing tradeoff possible for
the relay channel. With optimal long-term power control over the fading relay
channel, the proposed design achieves a delay-limited rate performance that is
only 3.0dB (5.4dB) worse than the capacity performance of the additive white
Gaussian channel in low- (high-) rate scenarios.",2007-01-04T02:08:44Z
"Anomalous thermodynamics of Coulomb interacting massless Dirac fermions
  in two spatial dimensions","It is argued that the specific heat of $N$ massless Dirac fermions in 2
spatial dimensions interacting with 1/r Coulomb interactions is suppressed
logarithmically relative to its non-interacting counterpart. The
(dimensionless) coefficient of the logarithm is calculated analytically in the
leading order in large $N$ expansion, but to all orders in $e^2N$, a procedure
which takes into account finite temperature screening. Experimental observation
of this effect is expected to occur in a single layer graphene embedded in a
dielectric medium. Its dependence on the dielectric constant is calculated
analytically.",2007-01-08T13:29:20Z
Electron turbulence at nanoscale junctions,"Electron transport through a nanostructure can be characterized in part using
concepts from classical fluid dynamics. It is thus natural to ask how far the
analogy can be taken, and whether the electron liquid can exhibit nonlinear
dynamical effects such as turbulence. Here we present an ab-initio study of the
electron dynamics in nanojunctions which reveals that the latter indeed
exhibits behavior quite similar to that of a classical fluid. In particular, we
find that a transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs with increasing
current, corresponding to increasing Reynolds numbers. These results reveal
unexpected features of electron dynamics and shed new light on our
understanding of transport properties of nanoscale systems.",2007-03-02T23:30:32Z
"The Razumov-Stroganov conjecture: Stochastic processes, loops and
  combinatorics","A fascinating conjectural connection between statistical mechanics and
combinatorics has in the past five years led to the publication of a number of
papers in various areas, including stochastic processes, solvable lattice
models and supersymmetry. This connection, known as the Razumov-Stroganov
conjecture, expresses eigenstates of physical systems in terms of objects known
from combinatorics, which is the mathematical theory of counting. This note
intends to explain this connection in light of the recent papers by Zinn-Justin
and Di Francesco.",2007-02-19T11:44:08Z
"Triangular Mott-Hubbard Insulator Phases of Sn/Si(111) and Sn/Ge(111)
  Surfaces","The ground state of Sn/Si(111) and Sn/Ge(111) surface $\alpha$-phases is
reexamined theoretically, based on $ab-initio$ calculations where correlations
are approximately included through the orbital dependence of the Coulomb
interaction (in the local density + Hubbard U approximation). The effect of
correlations is to destabilize the vertical buckling in Sn/Ge(111) and to make
the surface magnetic, with a metal-insulator transition for both systems. This
signals the onset of a stable narrow gap Mott-Hubbard insulating state, in
agreement with very recent experiments. Antiferromagnetic exchange is proposed
to be responsible for the observed $\Gamma$-point photoemission intensity, as
well asfor the partial metallization observed above above 60 K in Sn/Si(111).
  Extrinsic metallization of Sn/Si(111) by, $e.g.$ alkali doping, could lead to
a novel 2D triangular superconducting state of this and similar surfaces.",2007-03-07T10:28:54Z
CVD of CrO2: towards a lower temperature deposition process,"We report on the synthesis of highly oriented a-axis CrO2 films onto (0001)
sapphire by atmospheric pressure CVD from CrO3 precursor, at growth
temperatures down to 330 degree Celsius, i.e. close to 70 degrees lower than in
published data for the same chemical system. The films keep the high quality
magnetic behaviour as those deposited at higher temperature, which can be
looked as a promising result in view of their use with thermally sensitive
materials, e.g. narrow band gap semiconductors.",2007-01-26T20:25:27Z
"Simulation studies of a phenomenological model for elongated virus
  capsid formation","We study a phenomenological model in which the simulated packing of hard,
attractive spheres on a prolate spheroid surface with convexity constraints
produces structures identical to those of prolate virus capsid structures. Our
simulation approach combines the traditional Monte Carlo method with a modified
method of random sampling on an ellipsoidal surface and a convex hull searching
algorithm. Using this approach we identify the minimum physical requirements
for non-icosahedral, elongated virus capsids, such as two aberrant flock house
virus (FHV) particles and the prolate prohead of bacteriophage $\phi_{29}$, and
discuss the implication of our simulation results in the context of recent
experimental findings. Our predicted structures may also be experimentally
realized by evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal spheres.",2007-01-06T14:14:01Z
A time-dependent approach to electron pumping in open quantum systems,"We propose a time-dependent approach to investigate the motion of electrons
in quantum pump device configurations. The occupied one-particle states are
propagated in real time and used to calculate the local electron density and
current. An advantage of the present computational scheme is that the same
computational effort is required to simulate monochromatic, polychromatic and
nonperiodic drivings. Furthermore, initial state dependence and history effects
are naturally accounted for. This approach can also be embedded in the
framework of time-dependent density functional theory to include
electron-electron interactions. In the special case of periodic drivings we
combine the Floquet theory with nonequilibrium Green's functions and obtain a
general expression for the pumped current in terms of inelastic transmission
probabilities. This latter result is used for benchmarking our propagation
scheme in the long-time limit. Finally, we discuss the limitations of
Floquet-based schemes and suggest our approach as a possible way to go beyond
them.",2007-01-12T15:14:21Z
"Influence of trigonal warping on interference effects in bilayer
  graphene","Bilayer graphene (two coupled graphitic monolayers arranged according to
Bernal stacking) is a two-dimensional gapless semiconductor with a peculiar
electronic spectrum different from the Dirac spectrum in the monolayer
material. In particular, the electronic Fermi line in each of its valleys has a
strong p -> -p asymmetry due to a trigonal warping, which suppresses the weak
localization effect. We show that weak localisation in bilayer graphene may be
present only in devices with pronounced intervalley scattering, and we evaluate
the corresponding magnetoresistance.",2007-01-29T15:02:37Z
Current sharing between superconducting film and normal metal,"A two-dimensional model is introduced that describes current sharing between
the superconducting and normal metal layers in configuration typical of
YBCO-coated conductors. The model is used to compare the effectiveness of
surround stabilizer and more conventional one-sided stabilizer. When the
resistance of the interface between the superconductor and stabilizer is low
enough, the surround stabilizer is less effective than the one-sided stabilizer
in stabilizing a hairline crack in the superconducting film.",2007-03-07T19:48:15Z
Parameterized Algorithms for Directed Maximum Leaf Problems,"We prove that finding a rooted subtree with at least $k$ leaves in a digraph
is a fixed parameter tractable problem. A similar result holds for finding
rooted spanning trees with many leaves in digraphs from a wide family $\cal L$
that includes all strong and acyclic digraphs. This settles completely an open
question of Fellows and solves another one for digraphs in $\cal L$. Our
algorithms are based on the following combinatorial result which can be viewed
as a generalization of many results for a `spanning tree with many leaves' in
the undirected case, and which is interesting on its own: If a digraph $D\in
\cal L$ of order $n$ with minimum in-degree at least 3 contains a rooted
spanning tree, then $D$ contains one with at least $(n/2)^{1/5}-1$ leaves.",2007-02-08T18:25:08Z
Quantum melting of a crystal of dipolar bosons,"We investigate the behaviour of dipolar bosons in two dimensions. We describe
the large density crystalline limit analytically while we use quantum
Monte-Carlo to study the melting toward the Bose-Einstein condensate. We find
strong evidence for a first order transition. We characterize the window of
experimentally accessible parameters in the context of ultracold bosons and
show that observing the quantum melting should be within grasp once one is able
to form cold heteronuclear molecules. Close to the melting, we can not conclude
on the existence of a supersolid phase due to an insufficient overlap of our
variational Bijl-Jastrow Ansatz with the actual ground state.",2007-03-23T14:35:50Z
On vocabulary size of grammar-based codes,"We discuss inequalities holding between the vocabulary size, i.e., the number
of distinct nonterminal symbols in a grammar-based compression for a string,
and the excess length of the respective universal code, i.e., the code-based
analog of algorithmic mutual information. The aim is to strengthen inequalities
which were discussed in a weaker form in linguistics but shed some light on
redundancy of efficiently computable codes. The main contribution of the paper
is a construction of universal grammar-based codes for which the excess lengths
can be bounded easily.",2007-01-08T13:00:23Z
The Bazanski Approach in Brane Worlds: A Brief Introduction,"Paths of test particles, rotating and charged objects in brane-worlds using a
modified Bazanski Lagrangian are derived. We also discuss the transition to
their corresponding equations in four dimensions. We then make a comparison
between the given equations in brane-worlds (BW) and their analog in
space-time-matter (STM) theory.",2007-01-02T05:33:50Z
"On model selection forecasting, Dark Energy and modified gravity","The Fisher matrix approach (Fisher 1935) allows one to calculate in advance
how well a given experiment will be able to estimate model parameters, and has
been an invaluable tool in experimental design. In the same spirit, we present
here a method to predict how well a given experiment can distinguish between
different models, regardless of their parameters. From a Bayesian viewpoint,
this involves computation of the Bayesian evidence. In this paper, we
generalise the Fisher matrix approach from the context of parameter fitting to
that of model testing, and show how the expected evidence can be computed under
the same simplifying assumption of a gaussian likelihood as the Fisher matrix
approach for parameter estimation. With this `Laplace approximation' all that
is needed to compute the expected evidence is the Fisher matrix itself. We
illustrate the method with a study of how well upcoming and planned experiments
should perform at distinguishing between Dark Energy models and modified
gravity theories. In particular we consider the combination of 3D weak lensing,
for which planned and proposed wide-field multi-band imaging surveys will
provide suitable data, and probes of the expansion history of the Universe,
such as proposed supernova and baryonic acoustic oscillations surveys. We find
that proposed large-scale weak lensing surveys from space should be able
readily to distinguish General Relativity from modified gravity models.",2007-03-08T21:00:57Z
"Electron spin quantum beats in positively charged quantum dots: nuclear
  field effects","We have studied the electron spin coherence in an ensemble of positively
charged InAs/GaAs quantum dots. In a transverse magnetic field, we show that
two main contributions must be taken into account to explain the damping of the
circular polarization oscillations. The first one is due to the nuclear field
fluctuations from dot to dot experienced by the electron spin. The second one
is due to the dispersion of the transverse electron Lande g-factor, due to the
inherent inhomogeneity of the system, and leads to a field dependent
contribution to the damping. We have developed a model taking into account both
contributions, which is in good agreement with the experimental data. This
enables us to extract the pure contribution to dephasing due to the nuclei.",2007-01-12T17:13:58Z
Disordered locality in loop quantum gravity states,"We show that loop quantum gravity suffers from a potential problem with
non-locality, coming from a mismatch between micro-locality, as defined by the
combinatorial structures of their microscopic states, and macro-locality,
defined by the metric which emerges from the low energy limit. As a result, the
low energy limit may suffer from a disordered locality characterized by
identifications of far away points. We argue that if such defects in locality
are rare enough they will be difficult to detect.",2007-02-07T22:30:02Z
Theory of Optical Transmission through Elliptical Nanohole Arrays,"We present a theory which explains (in the quasistatic limit) the
experimentally observed [R. Gordon, {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92},
037401 (2004)] squared dependence of the depolarization ratio on the aspect
ratio of the holes, as well as other features of extraordinary light
transition. We calculated the effective dielectric tensor of a metal film
penetrated by elliptical cylindrical holes and found the extraordinarily light
transmission at special frequencies related to the surface plasmon resonances
of the composite film. We also propose to use the magnetic field for getting a
strong polarization effect, which depends on the ratio of the cyclotron to
plasmon frequencies.",2007-02-01T22:50:05Z
"Correlations and entanglements in a few-electron quantum dot without
  Zeeman splitting","We explore the correlations and entanglements of exact-diagonalized
few-electron wave functions in a quantum dot in magnetic fields without the
Zeeman splitting. With the increase of the field, the lowest states with
different spins gradually form a narrow band and the electronic states undergo
a transition from liquids to rotating Wigner molecules which are accompanied by
different characters of charge correlations. For both the liquid and crystal
states, the spin conditional probability densities show magnetic couplings
between the particles which depend on the particle numbers, the total spins and
the angular momenta of the states. The von Neumann entropies show the
spin-dependent entanglements between electrons. The regular magnetic-coupling
oscillations and converging entanglement entropies emerge in the rotating
Wigner molecular states.",2007-01-10T03:09:04Z
Imbalanced Fermi superfluid in a one-dimensional optical potential,"The superfluid properties of a two-state Fermi mixture in an optical lattice
are profoundly modified when an imbalance in the population of the two states
is present.We present analytical solutions for the free energy, and for the gap
and number equations in the saddle-point approximation describing resonant
superfluidity in the quasi-two-dimensional gas. Inhomogeneities due to the
trapping potentials can be taken into account using the local density
approximation. Analyzing the free energy in this approximation, we find that
phase separation occurs in the layers. The phase diagram of the superfluid and
normal phases is derived and analytical expressions for the phase lines are
presented. We complete the investigation by accounting for effects beyond
mean-field in the BEC limit where the system is more properly described as a
Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms and molecules.",2007-01-12T12:57:32Z
Dark Matter as a Consequence of Nonseparable Lagrangian,This paper has been withdrawn by the author.,2007-01-07T21:43:15Z
Ultra-fast relaxation of electrons in wide-gap dielectrics,"Low-energy electrons scattered in the conduction band of a dielectric solid
should behave like Bloch electrons and will interact with perturbations of the
atomic lattice, i.e. with phonons. Thus the phonon-based description of
low-energy scattering within an energy band structure of a solid bears certain
advantages against common free-electron scattering mechanisms. Moreover, the
inelastic scattering is described by the dielectric energy loss function. With
these collective scattering models we have performed the simulation of excited
electron relaxation and attenuation in the insulator SiO2. After excitation to
a mean initial energy of several eV their energy relaxation occurs within a
short time interval of 200 fs to full thermalization. There is a very rapid
impact ionization cooling connected with cascading of electrons at the
beginning during the first 10 fs, followed by much slower attenuation due to
phonon losses in wide-gap dielectrics and insulators.",2007-02-26T20:39:31Z
"Adhesive contact of a compliant sphere to an elastic coated substrate:
  the thin film limit","Experimental results for adhesive contacts on substrates coated with
elastomeric thin films have recently been obtained by C. Tardivat and L.
L\'{e}ger (J. Adhesion Sci. Technol. 15 1055-1078 (2001)) by the so-called JKR
test, which provides both adhesion energy and elastic modulus. These data show
that on substrates coated with thin films the adhesion and effective elastic
modulus of the sphere depend upon the film thickness. In keeping with the
experimental conditions, we try to interpret these data using a simple model
(E. Barthel and A. Perriot, J. Phys. D 40, 1059-1067 (2007)) in the thin film
limit, ie when the film thickness is small compared to the contact radius.
Although the film does impact the local crack tip stress field, we show that no
effect on the macroscopic contact variables is expected for the adhesion to
coated substrates in such confined geometries. The deviations from the
experimental results are ascribed to the idealized contact boundary conditions
assumed in the model.",2007-03-23T12:50:32Z
Loading chromium atoms in a magnetic guide,"We have realized a magnetic guide for ultracold chromium atoms by
continuously loading atoms directly from a Zeeman slower into a horizontal
guide. We observe an atomic flux of $2 \cdot 10^7$ atoms/s and are able to
control the mean velocity of the guided atoms between 0 m/s and 3 m/s. We
present our experimental results on loading and controlling the mean velocity
of the guided atoms and discuss the experimental techniques that are used.",2007-01-15T11:18:22Z
Expansion of a Bose-Einstein Condensate in the Presence of Disorder,"Expansion of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied, in the presence of
a random potential. The expansion is controlled by a single parameter,
$(\mu\tau_{eff} /\hbar)$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential, prior to the
release of the BEC from the trap, and $\tau_{eff}$ is a transport relaxation
time which characterizes the strength of the disorder. Repulsive interactions
(nonlinearity) facilitate transport and can lead to diffusive spreading of the
condensate which, in the absence of interactions, would have remained localized
in the vicinity of its initial location.",2007-01-15T19:41:59Z
"""Waterfalls"" in cuprates","New hot topic in ARPES on HTSC, the observation of the so called
""waterfalls"", is addressed. The energy scale at about 0.2-0.3 eV that can be
derived from the coherent component of ARPES spectra measured along the nodal
direction is not new but has been already discussed in terms of a coupling to a
bosonic continuum. However, the waterfalls, namely the long vertical parts of
the experimental dispersion around the center of the Brillouin zone (BZ), seem
to be purely artificial. They are a consequence of simple matrix-element
effect: a complete suppression of the photoemission intensity from both the
coherent and ""incoherent"" components. When the matrix-elements are taken into
account, the latter reveals a grid-like structure along the bonding directions
in the BZ.",2007-02-16T19:54:20Z
Observation of a Glassy Phase in Solid 4He in the Supersolidity Region,"High-precision pressure measurements in solid 4He, grown by the capillary
blocking technique, have been made in temperatures range from 50 to 500 mK. The
temperature dependence of pressure indicates that aside from the usual phonon
contribution ~T^4, there is an additional contribution ~ T^2, the latter
becoming dominant at temperatures T < 300 mK, where an abnormal behavior
attributed to supersolidity has been observed. The data suggest the appearance
of a glassy phase (that might be responsible for the anomalous behaviors
observed previously).",2007-02-06T09:17:40Z
"Extensions to the Kondo lattice model to achieve realistic Curie
  temperatures and appropriate behavior of the resistivity for manganites","We investigate the influence of the Jahn-Teller distortion and a direct
antiferromagnetic moment coupling as extensions to a two-band Kondo lattice
model for the magnetic and electronic properties of manganites. Those are
calculated self-consistently via an interpolating self-energy model and a
modified RKKY technique using finite Hund coupling and quantum spins. We found
that both effects are essential to achieve realistic Curie temperatures if we
regard intraband Coulomb repulsion. Using reliable model parameters we got
results which are in very good agreement with experimental data in the whole
ferromagnetic doping range. In the calculated phase diagram there are
ferromagnetic metal to paramagnetic insulator transitions, accompanied by a
Colossal Magnetoresistance (CMR) behavior. To improve the comparability of the
measured behavior of the resistivity with the calculated one, we have to switch
on interband Coulomb correlations.",2007-02-26T11:09:34Z
"Driven polymer translocation through a nanopore: a manifestation of
  anomalous diffusion","We study the translocation dynamics of a polymer chain threaded through a
nanopore by an external force. By means of diverse methods (scaling arguments,
fractional calculus and Monte Carlo simulation) we show that the relevant
dynamic variable, the translocated number of segments $s(t)$, displays an {\em
anomalous} diffusive behavior even in the {\em presence} of an external force.
The anomalous dynamics of the translocation process is governed by the same
universal exponent $\alpha = 2/(2\nu +2 - \gamma_1)$, where $\nu$ is the Flory
exponent and $\gamma_1$ - the surface exponent, which was established recently
for the case of non-driven polymer chain threading through a nanopore. A closed
analytic expression for the probability distribution function $W(s, t)$, which
follows from the relevant {\em fractional} Fokker - Planck equation, is derived
in terms of the polymer chain length $N$ and the applied drag force $f$. It is
found that the average translocation time scales as $\tau \propto
f^{-1}N^{\frac{2}{\alpha} -1}$. Also the corresponding time dependent
statistical moments, $< s(t) > \propto t^{\alpha}$ and $< s(t)^2 > \propto
t^{2\alpha}$ reveal unambiguously the anomalous nature of the translocation
dynamics and permit direct measurement of $\alpha$ in experiments. These
findings are tested and found to be in perfect agreement with extensive Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations.",2007-02-20T14:55:28Z
Pulsar Nulling and Mode Changing,"With its relatively long observation time per pointing, the Parkes multibeam
survey was effective in detecting nulling pulsars. We have made 2-hour
observations of 23 pulsars which showed evidence for pulse nulling or mode
changing in the survey data. Because of the low flux density of these pulsars,
in most cases averaging times of between 10 s and 60 s were necessary and so
this analysis is insensitive to very short nulls. Seven of the pulsars had null
fractions of more than 40% with the largest having a lower limit of 95%. Mode
changes were observed in six pulsars with clear relationships between nulling
and mode changing in some cases. Combined with earlier results, the data
suggest that large null fractions are more related to large characteristic age
than to long pulse period. The observations suggest that nulling and mode
changing are different manifestations of the same phenomenon.",2007-03-10T16:55:13Z
Finite Larmor Radius Effects on the Magnetorotational Instability,"The linear dispersion relation for the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is
derived including finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects. In particular, the
Braginskii form of the ion gyroviscosity, which represents the first-order FLR
corrections to the two-fluid equations, is retained. It is shown that FLR
effects are the most important effects in the limit of weak magnetic fields,
and are much more important than the Hall effect when beta >> 1, where beta is
the ratio of the ion thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure. FLR effects may
completely stabilize even MRI modes having wavelengths much greater than the
ion Larmor radius. Some implications for astrophysical accretion disks are
discussed.",2007-03-13T04:16:48Z
"Persistent spin and charge currents and magnification effects in open
  ring conductors subject to Rashba coupling","We analyze the effect of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and of a local tunnel
barrier on the persistent spin and charge currents in a one-dimensional
conducting Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring symmetrically coupled to two leads. First,
as an important consequence of the spin-splitting, it is found that a
persistent spin current can be induced which is not simply proportional to the
charge current. Second, a magnification effect of the persistent spin current
is shown when one tunes the Fermi energy near the Fano-type antiresonances of
the total transmission coefficient governed by the tunnel barrier strength. As
an unambiguous signature of spin-orbit coupling we also show the possibility to
produce a persistent pure spin current at the interference zeros of the
transmittance. This widens the possibilities of employing mesoscopic conducting
rings in phase-coherent spintronics applications.",2007-01-18T17:01:23Z
"Preeminent role of the Van Hove singularity in the strong-coupling
  analysis of scanning tunneling spectroscopy for two-dimensional cuprates","In two dimensions the non-interacting density of states displays a Van Hove
singularity (VHS) which introduces an intrinsic electron-hole asymmetry, absent
in three dimensions. We show that due to this VHS the strong-coupling analysis
of tunneling spectra in high-$T_c$ superconductors must be reconsidered. Based
on a microscopic model which reproduces the experimental data with great
accuracy, we elucidate the peculiar role played by the VHS in shaping the
tunneling spectra, and show that more conventional analyses of strong-coupling
effects can lead to severe errors.",2007-03-05T18:02:08Z
Spin Hall Effect For Anyons,"We explain the intrinsic spin Hall effect from generic anyon dynamics in the
presence of external electromagnetic field. The free anyon is represented as a
spinning particle with an underlying non-commutative configuration space. The
Berry curvature plays a major role in the analysis.",2007-01-05T10:31:48Z
On the extrinsic piezoelectricity,"This work presents a continuation of our last paper, concerning the theory of
the response of an antiparallel domain structure in a plate-like electroded
sample to external electric field. The theory is based on the exact formula for
free energy of the system, formed of a central ferroelectric part, isolated
from electrodes (with a defined potential difference) by a surface layers. Our
calculations are applicable also to thin films. It is usual to use the term
`extrinsic' for the contribution of domain walls displacement to macroscopic
properties of a sample. In our last paper we discussed the extrinsic
contribution to permittivity. In this work we concentrate on extrinsic
contribution to piezoelectric coefficients in ferroelectrics which are
simultaneously ferroelastics. As an example, we calculate the extrinsic
contribution to d_36 piezoelectric coefficient of RbH2PO4, that was recently
measured in a wide range of temperature below Curie point.",2007-02-13T14:54:34Z
"Finitely coordinated models for low-temperature phases of amorphous
  systems","We introduce models of heterogeneous systems with finite connectivity defined
on random graphs to capture finite-coordination effects on the low-temperature
behavior of finite dimensional systems. Our models use a description in terms
of small deviations of particle coordinates from a set of reference positions,
particularly appropriate for the description of low-temperature phenomena. A
Born-von-Karman type expansion with random coefficients is used to model
effects of frozen heterogeneities. The key quantity appearing in the
theoretical description is a full distribution of effective single-site
potentials which needs to be determined self-consistently. If microscopic
interactions are harmonic, the effective single-site potentials turn out to be
harmonic as well, and the distribution of these single-site potentials is
equivalent to a distribution of localization lengths used earlier in the
description of chemical gels. For structural glasses characterized by
frustration and anharmonicities in the microscopic interactions, the
distribution of single-site potentials involves anharmonicities of all orders,
and both single-well and double well potentials are observed, the latter with a
broad spectrum of barrier heights. The appearance of glassy phases at low
temperatures is marked by the appearance of asymmetries in the distribution of
single-site potentials, as previously observed for fully connected systems.
Double-well potentials with a broad spectrum of barrier heights and asymmetries
would give rise to the well known universal glassy low temperature anomalies
when quantum effects are taken into account.",2007-03-20T21:54:38Z
"Irradiation-induced Ag nanocluster nucleation in silicate glasses:
  analogy with photography","The synthesis of Ag nanoclusters in sodalime silicate glasses and silica was
studied by optical absorption (OA) and electron spin resonance (ESR)
experiments under both low (gamma-ray) and high (MeV ion) deposited energy
density irradiation conditions. Both types of irradiation create electrons and
holes whose density and thermal evolution - notably via their interaction with
defects - are shown to determine the clustering and growth rates of Ag
nanocrystals. We thus establish the influence of redox interactions of defects
and silver (poly)ions. The mechanisms are similar to the latent image formation
in photography: irradiation-induced photoelectrons are trapped within the glass
matrix, notably on dissolved noble metal ions and defects, which are thus
neutralized (reverse oxidation reactions are also shown to exist). Annealing
promotes metal atom diffusion, which in turn leads to cluster nuclei formation.
The cluster density depends not only on the irradiation fluence, but also - and
primarily - on the density of deposited energy and the redox properties of the
glass. Ion irradiation (i.e., large deposited energy density) is far more
effective in cluster formation, despite its lower neutralization efficiency
(from Ag+ to Ag0) as compared to gamma photon irradiation.",2007-03-20T10:02:57Z
"Structural distortion and magnetism of BiFeO3 epitaxial thin films: a
  Raman spectroscopy and neutron diffraction study","A previous study of the growth conditions has shown that single-phase BiFeO3
thin films can only be obtained in a narrow pressure-temperature window and
that these films display a weak magnetic moment. Here we study in more detail
the structure and the magnetism of single-phase BiFeO3 films by means of
reciprocal space mapping, Raman spectroscopy and neutron diffraction. X-ray and
Raman data suggest that the BiFeO3 structure is tetragonal for 70 nm-thick
films and changes to monoclinic for 240 nm-thick films, thus remaining
different from that of the bulk (rhombohedral) structure. In the 240 nm
monoclinically distorted film neutron diffraction experiments allow the
observation of a G-type antiferromagnetic order as in bulk single crystals.
However, the satellite peaks associated with the long-wavelength cycloid
present in bulk BiFeO3 are not observed. The relevance of these findings for
the exploitation of the magnetoelectric properties of BiFeO3 is discussed.",2007-01-22T11:15:34Z
"Superfluid Insulator Transitions of Hard-Core Bosons on the Checkerboard
  Lattice","We study hard-core bosons on the checkerboard lattice with nearest neighbour
unfrustrated hopping $t$ and `tetrahedral' plaquette charging energy $U$.
Analytical arguments and Quantum Monte Carlo simulations lead us to the
conclusion that the system undergoes a zero temperature ($T$) quantum phase
transition from a superfluid phase at small $U/t$ to a large $U/t$ Mott
insulator phase with $\rho$ = 1/4 for a range of values of the chemical
potential $\mu$. Further, the quarter-filled insulator breaks lattice
translation symmetry in a characteristic four-fold ordering pattern, and
occupies a lobe of finite extent in the $\mu$-$U/t$ phase diagram. A Quantum
Monte-Carlo study slightly away from the tip of the lobe provides evidence for
a direct weakly first-order superfluid-insulator transition away from the tip
of the lobe. While analytical arguments leads us to conclude that the
transition {\em at} the tip of the lobe belongs to a different landau-forbidden
second-order universality class, an extrapolation of our numerical results
suggests that the size of the first-order jump does not go to zero even at the
tip of the lobe.",2007-01-19T13:00:11Z
"Density-functional theory study of half-metallic heterostructures:
  interstitial Mn in Si","Using density-functional theory within the generalized gradient
approximation, we show that Si-based heterostructures with 1/4 layer
$\delta$-doping of {\em interstitial} Mn (Mn$_{\mathrm int}$) are
half-metallic. For Mn$_{\mathrm int}$ concentrations of 1/2 or 1 layer, the
states induced in the band gap of $\delta$-doped heterostructures still display
high spin polarization, about 85% and 60%, respectively. The proposed
heterostructures are more stable than previously assumed $\delta$-layers of
{\em substitutional} Mn. Contrary to wide-spread belief, the present study
demonstrates that {\em interstitial} Mn can be utilized to tune the magnetic
properties of Si, and thus provides a new clue for Si-based spintronics
materials.",2007-02-08T11:03:30Z
Estimation of the Rate-Distortion Function,"Motivated by questions in lossy data compression and by theoretical
considerations, we examine the problem of estimating the rate-distortion
function of an unknown (not necessarily discrete-valued) source from empirical
data. Our focus is the behavior of the so-called ""plug-in"" estimator, which is
simply the rate-distortion function of the empirical distribution of the
observed data. Sufficient conditions are given for its consistency, and
examples are provided to demonstrate that in certain cases it fails to converge
to the true rate-distortion function. The analysis of its performance is
complicated by the fact that the rate-distortion function is not continuous in
the source distribution; the underlying mathematical problem is closely related
to the classical problem of establishing the consistency of maximum likelihood
estimators. General consistency results are given for the plug-in estimator
applied to a broad class of sources, including all stationary and ergodic ones.
A more general class of estimation problems is also considered, arising in the
context of lossy data compression when the allowed class of coding
distributions is restricted; analogous results are developed for the plug-in
estimator in that case. Finally, consistency theorems are formulated for
modified (e.g., penalized) versions of the plug-in, and for estimating the
optimal reproduction distribution.",2007-02-02T18:23:45Z
"Evolution of magnetic component in Yang-Mills condensate dark energy
  models","The evolution of the electric and magnetic components in an effective
Yang-Mills condensate dark energy model is investigated. If the electric field
is dominant, the magnetic component disappears with the expansion of the
Universe. The total YM condensate tracks the radiation in the earlier Universe,
and later it becomes $w_y\sim-1$ thus is similar to the cosmological constant.
So the cosmic coincidence problem can be avoided in this model. However, if the
magnetic field is dominant, $w_y>1/3$ holds for all time, suggesting that it
cannot be a candidate for the dark energy in this case.",2007-01-25T02:27:24Z
"Charge carrier interaction with a purely electronic collective mode:
  Plasmarons and the infrared response of elemental bismuth","We present a detailed optical study of single crystal bismuth using infrared
reflectivity and ellipsometry. Colossal changes in the plasmon frequency are
observed as a function of temperature due to charge transfer between hole and
electron Fermi pockets. In the optical conductivity, an anomalous temperature
dependent mid-infrared absorption feature is observed. An extended Drude model
analysis reveals that it can be connected to a sharp upturn in the scattering
rate, the frequency of which exactly tracks the temperature dependent plasmon
frequency. We interpret this absorption and increased scattering as the first
direct optical evidence for a charge carrier interaction with a collective mode
of purely electronic origin; here electron-plasmon scattering. The observation
of a \emph{plasmaron} as such is made possible only by the unique coincidence
of various energy scales and exceptional properties of semi-metal bismuth.",2007-01-18T12:32:36Z
Wigner-Kirkwood expansion for semi-infinite quantum fluids,"For infinite (bulk) quantum fluids of particles interacting via pairwise
sufficiently smooth interactions, the Wigner-Kirkwood formalism provides a
semiclassical expansion of the Boltzmann density in configuration space in even
powers of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$. This result permits one
to generate an analogous $\lambda$-expansion for the bulk free energy and
many-body densities. The present paper brings a technically nontrivial
generalization of the Wigner-Kirkwood technique to semi-infinite quantum
fluids, constrained by a plane hard wall impenetrable to particles. In contrast
to the bulk case, the resulting Boltzmann density involves also
position-dependent terms of type $\exp(-2x^2/\lambda^2)$ ($x$ denotes the
distance from the wall boundary) which are non-analytic in $\lambda$. Under
some condition, the analyticity in $\lambda$ is restored by integrating the
Boltzmann density over configuration space; however, in contrast to the bulk
free energy, the semiclassical expansion of the surface part of the free energy
(surface tension) contains odd powers of $\lambda$, too. Explicit expressions
for the leading quantum corrections in the presence of the boundary are given
for the one-body and two-body densities. As model systems for explicit
calculations, we use Coulomb fluids, in particular the one-component plasma
defined in the $\nu$-dimensional (integer $\nu\ge 2$) space.",2007-01-31T11:01:39Z
Surface Spin-valve Effect,"We report an observation of spin-valve like hysteresis within a few atomic
layers at a ferromagnetic interface. We use phonon spectroscopy of nanometer
sized point contacts as an in-situ probe to study the mechanism of the effect.
Distinct in energy phonon peaks for contacts with dissimilar nonmagnetic outer
electrodes allow to localize the observed spin switching to the top or bottom
interfaces for nanometer thin ferromagnetic layers. The mechanism consistent
with our data is energetically distinct atomically thin surface spin layers
that can form current or field driven surface spin-valves within a single
ferromagnetic film.",2007-03-13T14:47:11Z
Normal metal - superconductor tunnel junction as a Brownian refrigerator,"Thermal noise generated by a hot resistor (resistance $R$) can, under proper
conditions, catalyze heat removal from a cold normal metal (N) in contact with
a superconductor (S) via a tunnel barrier. Such a NIS junction acts as
Maxwell's demon, rectifying the heat flow. Upon reversal of the temperature
gradient between the resistor and the junction the heat fluxes are reversed:
this presents a regime which is not accessible in an ordinary voltage-biased
NIS structure. We obtain analytical results for the cooling performance in an
idealized high impedance environment, and perform numerical calculations for
general $R$. We conclude by assessing the experimental feasibility of the
proposed effect.",2007-02-09T05:54:32Z
Wigner crystal and bubble phases in graphene in the quantum Hall regime,"Graphene, a single free-standing sheet of graphite with honeycomb lattice
structure, is a semimetal with carriers that have linear dispersion. A
consequence of this dispersion is the absence of Wigner crystallization in
graphene, since the kinetic and potential energies both scale identically with
the density of carriers. We study the ground state of graphene in the presence
of a strong magnetic field focusing on states with broken translational
symmetry. Our mean-field calculations show that at integer fillings a uniform
state is preferred, whereas at non-integer filling factors Wigner crystal
states (with broken translational symmetry) have lower energy. We obtain the
phase diagram of the system. We find that it is qualitatively similar to that
of quantum Hall systems in semiconductor heterostructures. Our analysis
predicts that non-uniform states, including Wigner crystal state, will occur in
graphene in the presence of a magnetic field and will lead to anisotropic
transport in high Landau levels.",2007-03-01T15:09:39Z
Transit-Time Spin Field-Effect-Transistor,"We propose and analyze a four-terminal metal-semiconductor device that uses
hot-electron transport through thin ferromagnetic films to inject and detect a
charge-coupled spin current transported through the conduction band of an
arbitrary semiconductor. This provides the possibility of realizing a spin
field-effect-transistor in Si, using electrostatic transit-time control in a
perpendicular magnetic field, rather than Rashba effect with spin-orbit
interaction.",2007-03-12T16:09:45Z
"Efficient and accurate three dimensional Poisson solver for surface
  problems","We present a method that gives highly accurate electrostatic potentials for
systems where we have periodic boundary conditions in two spatial directions
but free boundary conditions in the third direction. These boundary conditions
are needed for all kind of surface problems. Our method has an O(N log N)
computational cost, where N is the number of grid points, with a very small
prefactor. This Poisson solver is primarily intended for real space methods
where the charge density and the potential are given on a uniform grid.",2007-03-26T13:20:41Z
Work Fluctuations and Stochastic Resonance,"We study Brownian particle motion in a double-well potential driven by an ac
force. This system exhibits the phenomenon of stochastic resonance.
Distribution of work done on the system over a drive period in the time
asymptotic regime have been calculated. We show that fluctuations in the input
energy or work done dominate the mean value. The mean value of work done over a
period as a function of noise strength can also be used to characterise
stochastic resonance in the system. We also discuss the validity of steady
state fluctuation theorems in this particular system.",2007-01-14T06:40:14Z
Electronic structure of the electron-doped cuprate superconductors,"Within the framework of the kinetic energy driven d-wave superconductivity,
the electronic structure of the electron doped cuprate superconductors is
studied. It is shown that although there is an electron-hole asymmetry in the
phase diagram, the electronic structure of the electron-doped cuprates in the
superconducting-state is similar to that in the hole-doped case. With
increasing the electron doping, the spectral weight in the $(\pi,0)$ point
increases, while the position of the superconducting quasiparticle peak is
shifted towards the Fermi energy. In analogy to the hole-doped case, the
superconducting quasiparticles around the $(\pi,0)$ point disperse very weakly
with momentum.",2007-02-01T02:06:37Z
"Excitonic Bound State in the Extended Anderson Model with c-f Coulomb
  Interaction","The Anderson model with the Coulomb interaction between the local and
conduction electrons is studied in the semiconducting phase. Based on a
perturbation theory from the atomic limit, leading contributions for the c-f
Coulomb interaction are incorporated as a vertex correction to hybridization.
An analytical solution shows that the effective attraction in the intermediate
states leads to a bound state localized at the local electron site.
Self-consistent equations are constructed as an extension of the non-crossing
approximation (NCA) to include the vertex part yielding the bound state. A
numerical calculation demonstrates the excitonic bound state inside the
semiconducting gap for single-particle excitations, and a discontinuity at the
gap edge for magnetic excitations.",2007-02-07T04:58:50Z
"Quantum Conductance Oscillations in Metal/Molecule/Metal Switches at
  Room Temperature","Conductance switching has been reported in many molecular junction devices,
but in most cases has not been convincingly explained. We investigate
conductance switching in Pt/stearic acid monolayer/Ti devices using
pressure-modulated conductance microscopy. For devices with conductance G>>G_Q
or G<<G_Q, where GQ=2e^2/h is the conductance quantum, pressure-induced
conductance peaks <30 nm in diameter are observed, indicating the formation of
nanoscale conducting pathways between the electrodes. For devices with G~ 1- 2
G_Q, in addition to conductance peaks we also observed conductance dips and
oscillations in response to localized pressure. These results can be modeled by
considering interfering electron waves along a quantum conductance channel
between two partially transmitting electrode surfaces. Our findings underscore
the possible use of these devices as atomic-scale switches.",2007-03-10T05:18:09Z
"On the origin of unusual transport properties observed in densely packed
  polycrystalline CaAl_{2}","A possible origin of unusual temperature behavior of transport coefficients
observed in densely packed polycrystalline CaAl_{2} compound [M. Ausloos et
al., J. Appl. Phys. 96, 7338 (2004)] is discussed, including a power-like
dependence of resistivity with $\rho \propto T^{-3/4}$ and N-like form of the
thermopower. All these features are found to be in good agreement with the
Shklovskii-Efros localization scenario assuming polaron-mediated hopping
processes controlled by the Debye energy.",2007-01-18T18:33:37Z
"Electron Correlation and Pairing States in Superconductors without
  Inversion Symmetry","This article is a pedagogical review of theoretical studies of
noncentrosymmetric superconductors with particular emphasis on the role played
by electron correlation, which is important for heavy fermion systems. We
survey unique properties of parity-violated superconductivity such as the
admixture of spin singlet and triplet states, unusual paramagnetism, large
Pauli limiting fields, magnetoelectric effects, the helical vortex phase, and
the anomalous Hall effect. It is pointed out that these remarkable features are
strengthened by a strong electron correlation effect, and thus are prominent in
heavy fermion superconductors without inversion symmetry. We also discuss
possible pairing states realized in the heavy fermion system CePt$_3$Si.",2007-02-26T05:51:38Z
Stoichiometry of Electrostatic Complexes Determined by Light Scattering,"We report on the electrostatic complexation between oppositely charged
polymers and inorganic nanoparticles investigated by static and dynamical light
scattering. The nanoparticles put under scrutiny were citrate-coated
nanocrystals of cerium oxide (CeO2, nanoceria), of iron oxide (Fe2O3,
maghemite) and of europium-doped yttrium vanadate (Eu:YVO4) with sizes in the
10 nm range. For the polymers, we have used cationic-neutral diblock copolymers
(poly(trimethylammonium ethylacrylate)-b-poly(acrylamide), hereafter referred
to as PTEA-b-PAM) with different molecular weights. For the three colloidal
dispersions, we show that the electrostatic complexation gives rise to the
formation of stable nanoparticle clusters in the 100 nm range. The complexation
was monitored by systematic measurements of the scattering intensity versus X,
the mixing ratio between nanoparticles and polymers. For 5 nanoparticle/polymer
pairs, namely CeO2/PTEA5K-b-PAM30K, Fe2O3/PTEA5K-b-PAM30K,
Fe2O3/PTEA11K-b-PAM30K, Eu:YVO4/PTEA2K-b-PAM60K and Eu:YVO4/PTEA5K-b-PAM30K, we
found a unique behavior : the scattering intensity exhibits a sharp and
prominent peak in the intermediate X-range. To account for this behavior, we
have developed a model which assumes that regardless of X, the mixed aggregates
are formed at a fixed polymer-to-nanoparticle ratio. The agreement between the
results and the model is excellent on the 5 systems. Results at different
molecular weights suggest that the stoichiometry of the mixed aggregates is
controlled by the electrostatic interactions between the opposite charges. The
model allows to derive the molecular weight and the stoichiometry of the mixed
aggregates.",2007-01-26T16:46:03Z
Two-Temperature Model of non-equilibrium electron relaxation: A Review,"The present paper is a review of the phenomena related to non-equilibrium
electron relaxation in bulk and nano-scale metallic samples. The workable
Two-Temperature Model (TTM) based on Boltzmann-Bloch-Peierls (BBP) kinetic
equation has been applied to study the ultra-fast(femto-second) electronic
relaxation in various metallic systems. The advent of new ultra-fast
(femto-second) laser technology and pump-probe spectroscopy has produced wealth
of new results for micro and nano-scale electronic technology. The aim of this
paper is to clarify the TTM, conditions of its validity and non-validity, its
modifications for nano-systems, to sum-up the progress, and to point out open
problems in this field. We also give a phenomenological integro-differential
equation for the kinetics of non-degenerate electrons that goes beyond the TTM.",2007-02-14T13:10:05Z
"Reversible Ferromagnetic Switching in Zno:(Co,Mn) Powders","We report here on the magnetic properties of ZnO:Mn and ZnO:Co doped
nanoparticles. We have found that the ferromagnetism of ZnO:Mn can be switched
on and off by consecutive low-temperature annealings in O2 and N2 respectively,
while the opposite phenomenology was observed for ZnO:Co. These results suggest
that different defects (presumably n-type for ZnO:Co and p-type for ZnO:Mn) are
required to induce a ferromagnetic coupling in each case. We will argue that
ferromagnetism is likely to be restricted to a very thin, nanometric layer, at
the grain surface. These findings reveal and give insight into the dramatic
relevance of surface effects for the occurrence of ferromagnetism in ZnO doped
oxides.",2007-01-19T09:21:31Z
"Use of Superparamagnetic Nanoparticle/Block Copolymer Electrostatic
  Complexes as Contrast Agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging","During the past years we have investigated the complexation between
nanocolloids and oppositely charged polymers. The nanocolloids examined were
ionic surfactant micelles and inorganic oxide nanoparticles. For the polymers,
we used homopolyelectrolytes and block copolymers with linear and comb
architectures. In general, the attractive interactions between oppositely
charged species are strong and as such, the simple mixing of solutions
containing dispersed constituents yield to a precipitation, or to a phase
separation. We have developed means to control the electrostatically-driven
attractions and to preserve the stability of the mixed solution. With these
approaches, we designed novel core-shell nanostructures, e.g. as those obtained
with polymers and iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles. In this
presentation, we show that electrostatic complexation can be used to tailor new
functionalized nanoparticles and we provide examples related to biomedical
applications in the domain of contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging.",2007-01-26T16:53:45Z
"The superconducting gap in the Hubbard model and the two gap energy
  scales in high-Tc cuprates","Recent excperiments (ARPES, Raman) suggest the presence of two distinct
energy gaps in high-Tc superconductors (HTSC), exhibiting different doping
dependences. Results of a variational cluster approach to the superconducting
state of the two-dimensional Hubbard model are presented which show that this
model qualitatively describes this gap dichotomy: One gap (antinodal) increases
with less doping, a behavior long considered as reflecting the general gap
behavior of the HTSC. On the other hand, the near-nodal gap does even slightly
decrease with underdoping. An explanation of this unexpected behavior is given
which emphasizes the crucial role of spin fluctuations in the pairing
mechanism.",2007-02-16T12:52:57Z
Inequalities for the Local Energy of Random Ising Models,"We derive a rigorous lower bound on the average local energy for the Ising
model with quenched randomness. The result is that the lower bound is given by
the average local energy calculated in the absence of all interactions other
than the one under consideration. The only condition for this statement to hold
is that the distribution function of the random interaction under consideration
is symmetric. All other interactions can be arbitrarily distributed including
non-random cases. A non-trivial fact is that any introduction of other
interactions to the isolated case always leads to an increase of the average
local energy, which is opposite to ferromagnetic systems where the Griffiths
inequality holds. Another inequality is proved for asymmetrically distributed
interactions. The probability for the thermal average of the local energy to be
lower than that for the isolated case takes a maximum value on the Nishimori
line as a function of the temperature. In this sense the system is most stable
on the Nishimori line.",2007-03-08T14:42:35Z
Stochastic quantization of interacting classical particles system,"Starting from a many-body classical system governed by a trace-form entropy
we derive, in the stochastic quantization picture, a family of non linear and
non-Hermitian Schroedinger equations describing, in the mean filed
approximation, a quantum system of interacting particles. The time evolution of
the main physical observables is analyzed by means of the Ehrenfest equations
showing that, in general, this family of equations takes into account
dissipative and damped effects due to the interaction of the system with the
background. We explore the presence of steady states by means of solitons,
describing conservative solutions. The results are specialized to the case of a
system governed by the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy.",2007-03-05T10:49:40Z
"Dynamic Lattice Distortions in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: A microscopic study by
  perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) spectroscopy","Applying time differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) spectroscopy
and \emph{ab initio} calculations, we have investigated possible lattice
instabilities in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ by studying the electric quadrupole
interaction of a $^{111}$Cd probe at the Ru site. We find evidence for a
dynamic lattice distortion, revealed from the observations of: (i) a rapidly
fluctuating electric-field gradient (EFG) tensor of which the main component
decreases with decreasing temperature, and (ii) a monotonic increase of the EFG
asymmetry ($\eta$) below 300 K. We argue that the observed dynamic lattice
distortion is caused by strong spin fluctuations associated with the inherent
magnetic instability of Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$.",2007-01-04T06:27:42Z
"Detecting gravitational waves from inspiraling binaries with a network
  of detectors : coherent strategies by correlated detectors","We discuss the coherent search strategy to detect gravitational waves from
inspiraling compact binaries by a network of correlated laser interferometric
detectors. From the maximum likelihood ratio statistic, we obtain a coherent
statistic which is slightly different from and generally better than what we
obtained in our previous work. In the special case when the cross spectrum of
two detectors normalized by the power spectrum density is constant, the new
statistic agrees with the old one. The quantitative difference of the detection
probability for a given false alarm rate is also evaluated in a simple case.",2007-02-03T04:40:14Z
"PGPG: An Automatic Generator of Pipeline Design for Programmable GRAPE
  Systems","We have developed PGPG (Pipeline Generator for Programmable GRAPE), a
software which generates the low-level design of the pipeline processor and
communication software for FPGA-based computing engines (FBCEs). An FBCE
typically consists of one or multiple FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)
chips and local memory. Here, the term ""Field-Programmable"" means that one can
rewrite the logic implemented to the chip after the hardware is completed, and
therefore a single FBCE can be used for calculation of various functions, for
example pipeline processors for gravity, SPH interaction, or image processing.
The main problem with FBCEs is that the user need to develop the detailed
hardware design for the processor to be implemented to FPGA chips. In addition,
she or he has to write the control logic for the processor, communication and
data conversion library on the host processor, and application program which
uses the developed processor. These require detailed knowledge of hardware
design, a hardware description language such as VHDL, the operating system and
the application, and amount of human work is huge. A relatively simple design
would require 1 person-year or more. The PGPG software generates all necessary
design descriptions, except for the application software itself, from a
high-level design description of the pipeline processor in the PGPG language.
The PGPG language is a simple language, specialized to the description of
pipeline processors. Thus, the design of pipeline processor in PGPG language is
much easier than the traditional design. For real applications such as the
pipeline for gravitational interaction, the pipeline processor generated by
PGPG achieved the performance similar to that of hand-written code. In this
paper we present a detailed description of PGPG version 1.0.",2007-03-08T15:42:53Z
Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in resonant Fermi gas,"We construct the phase diagram of a homogeneous two component Fermi gas with
population imbalance under a Feshbach resonance. In particular, we study the
physics and stability of the Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase. We show that this phase
is stable over a much larger parameter range than what has been previously
reported by other authors.",2007-03-08T10:58:04Z
"Crossover behavior and multi-step relaxation in a schematic model of the
  cut-off glass transition","We study a schematic mode-coupling model in which the ideal glass transition
is cut off by a decay of the quadratic coupling constant in the memory
function. (Such a decay, on a time scale tau_I, has been suggested as the
likely consequence of activated processes.) If this decay is complete, so that
only a linear coupling remains at late times, then the alpha relaxation shows a
temporal crossover from a relaxation typical of the unmodified schematic model
to a final strongly slower-than-exponential relaxation. This crossover, which
differs somewhat in form from previous schematic models of the cut-off glass
transition, resembles light-scattering experiments on colloidal systems, and
can exhibit a `slower-than-alpha' relaxation feature hinted at there. We also
consider what happens when a similar but incomplete decay occurs, so that a
significant level of quadratic coupling remains for t>>tau_I. In this case the
correlator acquires a third, weaker relaxation mode at intermediate times. This
empirically resembles the beta process seen in many molecular glass formers. It
disappears when the initial as well as the final quadratic coupling lies on the
liquid side of the glass transition, but remains present even when the final
coupling is only just inside the liquid (so that the alpha relaxation time is
finite, but too long to measure). Our results are suggestive of how, in a
cut-off glass, the underlying `ideal' glass transition predicted by
mode-coupling theory can remain detectable through qualitative features in
dynamics.",2007-02-07T15:52:30Z
The analysis on the single particle model of CDW,"Gruner put forward a single particle model of charge-density wave, which is a
typical nonlinear differential equation, and also a mathematical model of
pendulum. This Letter analyzes the solution of equation by the rotated vector
fields theory, providing the relation between the applied field E and the
periodic solution, and the conclusion that the critical value of E for the
periodic solution is fixed in the over-damped situation. With these
conclusions, it derives the formulae of nonlinear conductivity, narrow-band
noise, which are consistent with the empirical ones given by Fleming.",2007-02-03T07:44:45Z
Temperature Hysteresis of Magnetization in Lanthanum Manganite,"We propose an explanation for the experimentally observed temperature
hysteresis of magnetization in single crystals of lanthanum manganite
(La0.8Sr0.2MnO3). The phenomenon is interpreted within the framework of a
double-exchange model with allowance for the interaction of the magnetic
subsystem with a bistable mode of the tilting-rotational oscillations in the
correlated sublattice of MnO6 octahedra.",2007-02-20T11:44:40Z
"Permutation Decoding and the Stopping Redundancy Hierarchy of Linear
  Block Codes","We investigate the stopping redundancy hierarchy of linear block codes and
its connection to permutation decoding techniques. An element in the ordered
list of stopping redundancy values represents the smallest number of possibly
linearly dependent rows in any parity-check matrix of a code that avoids
stopping sets of a given size. Redundant parity-check equations can be shown to
have a similar effect on decoding performance as permuting the coordinates of
the received codeword according to a selected set of automorphisms of the code.
Based on this finding we develop new decoding strategies for data transmission
over the binary erasure channel that combine iterative message passing and
permutation decoding in order to avoid errors confined to stopping sets. We
also introduce the notion of s-SAD sets, containing the smallest number of
automorphisms of a code with the property that they move any set of not more
than s erasures into positions that do not correspond to stopping sets within a
judiciously chosen parity-check matrix.",2007-02-08T19:28:24Z
Photon heat transport in low-dimensional nanostructures,"At low temperatures when the phonon modes are effectively frozen, photon
transport is the dominating mechanism of thermal relaxation in metallic
systems. Starting from a microscopic many-body Hamiltonian, we develop a
nonequilibrium Green's function method to study energy transport by photons in
nanostructures. A formally exact expression for the energy current between a
metallic island and a one-dimensional electromagnetic field is obtained. From
this expression we derive the quantized thermal conductance as well as show how
the results can be generalized to nonequilibrium situations. Generally, the
frequency-dependent current noise of the island electrons determines the energy
transfer rate.",2007-01-15T15:02:11Z
Cosmology with type-Ia supernovae,"I review the use of type-Ia supernovae (SNe) for cosmological studies. After
briefly recalling the main features of type-Ia SNe that lead to their use as
cosmological probes, I briefly describe current and planned type-Ia SNe
surveys, with special emphasis on their physics reach in the presence of
systematic uncertainties, which will be dominant in nearly all cases.",2007-03-16T22:06:30Z
Measurement of energy eigenstates by a slow detector,"We propose a method for a weak continuous measurement of the energy
eigenstates of a fast quantum system by means of a ""slow"" detector. Such a
detector is only sensitive to slowly-changing variables, e. g. energy, while
its back-action can be limited solely to decoherence of the eigenstate
superpositions. We apply this scheme to the problem of detection of quantum
jumps between energy eigenstates in a harmonic oscillator.",2007-02-04T05:37:04Z
"Effect of the metal-to-wire ratio on the high-frequency magnetoimpedance
  of glass-coated CoFeBSi amorphous microwires","High frequency [1-500 MHz] measurements of the magnetoimpedance (MI) of
glass-coated Co$_{69.4}$Fe$_{3.7}$B$_{15.9}$Si$_{11}$ microwires are carried
out with various metal-to-wire diameter ratios. A twin-peak, anhysteretic
behaviour is observed as a function of magnetic field. A maximum in the
normalized impedance, $\Delta Z$/$Z$, appears at different values of the
frequency $f$, 125, 140 and 85 MHz with the corresponding diameter ratio $p$ =
0.80, 0.55 and 0.32. We describe the measurement technique and interpret our
results with a thermodynamic model that leads to a clearer view of the effects
of $p$ on the maximum value of MI and the anisotropy field. The behavior of the
real and imaginary components of impedance is also investigated; they display a
resonance that becomes a function of the DC field $H_{DC}$ for values larger or
equal to $H_{K}$ the circumferential anisotropy field for each $p $ value.
These results are interpreted in terms of a rotation model of the outer shell
magnetization.",2007-01-04T16:19:50Z
"Replica Symmetry Breaking Condition Exposed by Random Matrix Calculation
  of Landscape Complexity","We start with a rather detailed, general discussion of recent results of the
replica approach to statistical mechanics of a single classical particle placed
in a random $N (\gg 1)$-dimensional Gaussian landscape and confined by a
spherically symmetric potential suitably growing at infinity. Then we employ
random matrix methods to calculate the density of stationary points, as well as
minima, of the associated energy surface. This is used to show that for a
generic smooth, concave confining potentials the condition of the
zero-temperature replica symmetry breaking coincides with one signalling that
{\it both} mean total number of stationary points in the energy landscape, {\it
and} the mean number of minima are exponential in $N$. For such systems the
(annealed) complexity of minima vanishes cubically when approaching the
critical confinement, whereas the cumulative annealed complexity vanishes
quadratically. Different behaviour reported in our earlier short communication
[Y.V. Fyodorov et al., {\it JETP Lett.} {\bf 85}, 261, (2007)] was due to
non-analyticity of the hard-wall confinement potential. Finally, for the
simplest case of parabolic confinement we investigate how the complexity
depends on the index of stationary points. In particular, we show that in the
vicinity of critical confinement the saddle-points with a positive annealed
complexity must be close to minima, as they must have a vanishing {\it
fraction} of negative eigenvalues in the Hessian.",2007-02-26T15:05:10Z
"Comparison between experiment and calculated band structures for DyN and
  SmN","We investigate the electronic band structure of two of the rare-earth
nitrides, DyN and SmN. Resistivity measurements imply that both materials have
a semiconducting ground state, and both show resistivity anomalies coinciding
with the magnetic transition, despite the different magnetic states in DyN and
SmN. X-ray absorption and emission measurements are in excellent agreement with
LSDA+U calculations, although for SmN the calculations predict a zero band gap.",2007-03-28T04:53:37Z
"Liquid crystals in two dimensions: First-order phase transitions and
  nonuniversal critical behavior","Liquid crystals in two dimensions undergo a first-order
isotropic-to-quasi-nematic transition, provided the particle interactions are
sufficiently ``sharp and narrow''. This implies phase coexistence between
isotropic and quasi-nematic domains, separated by interfaces. The corresponding
line tension is determined, and shown to be very small, giving rise to strong
interface fluctuations. When the interactions are no longer ``sharp and
narrow'', the transition becomes continuous, with non-universal critical
behavior obeying hyperscaling, and approximately resembling the two-dimensional
Potts model.",2007-03-29T06:45:59Z
The anisotropic XY model on the inhomogeneous periodic chain,"The static and dynamic properties of the anisotropic XY-model $(s=1/2)$ on
the inhomogeneous periodic chain, composed of $N$ cells with $n$ different
exchange interactions and magnetic moments, in a transverse field $h,$ are
determined exactly at arbitrary temperatures. The properties are obtained by
introducing the Jordan-Wigner fermionization and by reducing the problem to a
diagonalization of a finite matrix of $nth$ order. The quantum transitions are
determined exactly by analyzing, as a function of the field, the induced
magnetization $1/n\sum_{m=1}^{n}\mu_{m}\left< S_{j,m}^{z}\right>$ ($j$ denotes
the cell, $m$ the site within the cell, $\mu_{m}$ the magnetic moment at site
$m$ within the cell) and the spontaneous magnetization $1/n\sum_{m=1}^{n}\left<
S_{j,m}^{x},\right>$ which is obtained from the correlations $\left<
S_{j,m}^{x}S_{j+r,m}^{x}\right>$ for large spin separations. These results,
which are obtained for infinite chains, correspond to an extension of the ones
obtained by Tong and Zhong(\textit{Physica B} \textbf{304,}91 (2001)). The
dynamic correlations, $\left<
S_{j,m}^{z}(t)S_{j^{\prime},m^{\prime}}^{z}(0)\right>$, and the dynamic
susceptibility, $\chi_{q}^{zz}(\omega),$ are also obtained at arbitrary
temperatures. Explicit results are presented in the limit T=0, where the
critical behaviour occurs, for the static susceptibility $\chi_{q}^{zz}(0)$ as
a function of the transverse field $h$, and for the frequency dependency of
dynamic susceptibility $\chi_{q}^{zz}(\omega)$.",2007-01-25T19:00:51Z
Indirect forces between impurities in one-dimensional quantum liquids,"We investigate the indirect interaction between two isolated impurities in a
Luttinger liquid described by a microscopic lattice model. To treat the
electron-electron interaction U the functional renormalization group method is
used. For comparison we also study the U=0 case. We find that for a wide range
of impurity parameters the impurity interaction V_{12} as a function of their
separation r oscillates with decaying amplitude between being attractive and
repulsive. For half-filling of the band and in a crossover regime between weak
and strong impurities the interaction becomes purely attractive. For U=0 and
independent of the impurity strength the amplitude of the interaction energy
falls off as 1/r. For U>0 the decay for small separations and weak to
intermediate impurities is governed by a U dependent exponent larger than -1,
which crosses over to -1 for large r. The crossover scale depends on the
impurity strength and U. We present simple pictures which explain our results
in the limits of weak and strong impurities. We finally also consider
attractive interactions U<0.",2007-03-05T17:02:02Z
"Switchable coupling for superconducting qubits using double resonance in
  the presence of crosstalk","Several methods have been proposed recently to achieve switchable coupling
between superconducting qubits. We discuss some of the main considerations
regarding the feasibility of implementing one of those proposals: the
double-resonance method. We analyze mainly issues related to the achievable
effective coupling strength and the effects of crosstalk on this coupling
approach. We also find a new, crosstalk-assisted coupling channel that can be
an attractive alternative when implementing the double-resonance coupling
proposal.",2007-02-26T15:42:47Z
"Macroscopic quantum tunneling in ""small"" Josephson junctions in magnetic
  field","We study the phenomenon of macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in small
Josephson junctions (JJ) with an externally applied magnetic field. The latter
results in the appearance of the Fraunhofer type modulation of the current
density along the barrier. The problem of MQT for a point-like JJ is reduced to
the motion of the quantum particle in the washboard potential. In the case of a
finite size JJ under consideration, this problem corresponds to a MQT in
potential which itself, besides the phase, depends on space variables. Finally,
the general expression for the crossover temperature T_0 between thermally
activated and macroscopic quantum tunneling regimes and the escaping time
tau_esc have been calculated.",2007-01-31T15:28:17Z
Weighted network modules,"The inclusion of link weights into the analysis of network properties allows
a deeper insight into the (often overlapping) modular structure of real-world
webs. We introduce a clustering algorithm (CPMw, Clique Percolation Method with
weights) for weighted networks based on the concept of percolating k-cliques
with high enough intensity. The algorithm allows overlaps between the modules.
First, we give detailed analytical and numerical results about the critical
point of weighted k-clique percolation on (weighted) Erdos-Renyi graphs. Then,
for a scientist collaboration web and a stock correlation graph we compute
three-link weight correlations and with the CPMw the weighted modules. After
reshuffling link weights in both networks and computing the same quantities for
the randomised control graphs as well, we show that groups of 3 or more strong
links prefer to cluster together in both original graphs.",2007-03-27T10:29:32Z
"Information Loss as a Foundational Principle for the Second Law of
  Thermodynamics","In a previous paper [1] we considered the question, ""What underlying property
of nature is responsible for the second law?"" A simple answer can be stated in
terms of information: The fundamental loss of information gives rise to the
second law. This line of thinking highlights the existence of two independent
but coupled sets of laws: Information dynamics and energy dynamics. The
distinction helps shed light on certain foundational questions in statistical
mechanics. For example, the confusion surrounding previous ""derivations"" of the
second law from energy dynamics can be resolved by noting that such derivations
incorporate one or more assumptions that correspond to the loss of information.
In this paper we further develop and explore the perspective in which the
second law is fundamentally a law of information dynamics.",2007-03-09T01:39:57Z
"Time Reversal Mirror and Perfect Inverse Filter in a Microscopic Model
  for Sound Propagation","Time reversal of quantum dynamics can be achieved by a global change of the
Hamiltonian sign (a hasty Loschmidt daemon), as in the Loschmidt Echo
experiments in NMR, or by a local but persistent procedure (a stubborn daemon)
as in the Time Reversal Mirror (TRM) used in ultrasound acoustics. While the
first is limited by chaos and disorder, the last procedure seems to benefit
from it. As a first step to quantify such stability we develop a procedure, the
Perfect Inverse Filter (PIF), that accounts for memory effects, and we apply it
to a system of coupled oscillators. In order to ensure a many-body dynamics
numerically intrinsically reversible, we develop an algorithm, the pair
partitioning, based on the Trotter strategy used for quantum dynamics. We
analyze situations where the PIF gives substantial improvements over the TRM.",2007-02-13T14:11:30Z
Shape-induced phenomena in the finite size antiferromagnets,"It is of common knowledge that the direction of easy axis in the finite-size
ferromagnetic sample is controlled by its shape. In the present paper we show
that a similar phenomenon should be observed in the compensated
antiferromagnets with strong magnetoelastic coupling. Destressing energy which
originates from the long-range magnetoelastic forces is analogous to
demagnetization energy in ferromagnetic materials and is responsible for the
formation of equilibrium domain structure and anisotropy of macroscopic
magnetic properties. In particular, crystal shape may be a source of additional
uniaxial magnetic anisotropy which removes degeneracy of antiferromagnetic
vector or artificial 4th order anisotropy in the case of a square cross-section
sample. In a special case of antiferromagnetic nanopillars shape-induced
anisotropy can be substantially enhanced due to lattice mismatch with the
substrate. These effects can be detected by the magnetic rotational torque and
antiferromagnetic resonance measurements.",2007-01-25T19:02:18Z
"Hydrogen bonding and coordination in normal and supercritical water from
  X-ray inelastic scattering","A direct measure of hydrogen bonding in water under conditions ranging from
the normal state to the supercritical regime is derived from the Compton
scattering of inelastically-scattered X-rays. First, we show that a measure of
the number of electrons $n_e$ involved in hydrogen bonding at varying
thermodynamic conditions can be directly obtained from Compton profile
differences. Then, we use first-principles simulations to provide a connection
between $n_e$ and the number of hydrogen bonds $n_{HB}$. Our study shows that
over the broad range studied the relationship between $n_e$ and $n_{HB}$ is
linear, allowing for a direct experimental measure of bonding and coordination
in water. In particular, the transition to supercritical state is characterized
by a sharp increase in the number of water monomers, but also displays a
significant number of residual dimers and trimers.",2007-02-26T21:09:00Z
"Sideband Transitions and Two-Tone Spectroscopy of a Superconducting
  Qubit Strongly Coupled to an On-Chip Cavity","Sideband transitions are spectroscopically probed in a system consisting of a
Cooper pair box strongly but non-resonantly coupled to a superconducting
transmission line resonator. When the Cooper pair box is operated at the
optimal charge bias point the symmetry of the hamiltonian requires a two photon
process to access sidebands. The observed large dispersive ac-Stark shifts in
the sideband transitions induced by the strong non-resonant drives agree well
with our theoretical predictions. Sideband transitions are important in
realizing qubit-photon and qubit-qubit entanglement in the circuit quantum
electrodynamics architecture for quantum information processing.",2007-03-23T20:20:47Z
Tunneling exponents sensitive to impurity scattering in quantum wires,"We show that the scaling exponent for tunneling into a quantum wire in the
""Coulomb Tonks gas"" regime of impenetrable, but otherwise free, electrons is
affected by impurity scattering in the wire. The exponent for tunneling into
such a wire thus depends on the conductance through the wire. This striking
effect originates from a many-body scattering resonance reminiscent of the
Kondo effect. The predicted anomalous scaling is stable against weak
perturbations of the ideal Tonks gas limit at sufficiently high energies,
similar to the phenomenology of a quantum critical point.",2007-03-01T20:40:41Z
The Strange Man in Random Networks of Automata,"We have performed computer simulations of Kauffman's automata on several
graphs such as the regular square lattice and invasion percolation clusters in
order to investigate phase transitions, radial distributions of the mean total
damage (dynamical exponent $z$) and propagation speeds of the damage when one
adds a damaging agent, nicknamed ""strange man"". Despite the increase in the
damaging efficiency, we have not observed any appreciable change at the
transition threshold to chaos neither for the short-range nor for the
small-world case on the square lattices when the strange man is added in
comparison to when small initial damages are inserted in the system. The
propagation speed of the damage cloud until touching the border of the system
in both cases obeys a power law with a critical exponent $\alpha$ that strongly
depends on the lattice. Particularly, we have ckecked the damage spreading when
some connections are removed on the square lattice and when one considers
special invasion percolation clusters (high boundary-saturation clusters). It
is seen that the propagation speed in these systems is quite sensible to the
degree of dilution.",2007-02-07T20:32:42Z
"Sequential tunneling and shot noise in
  ferromagnet/normal-metal/ferromagnet double tunnel junctions","The tunneling through a ferromagnet/normal metal/ferromagnet double junction
in the Coulomb blockade regime is studied, assuming that the spin relaxation
time of electron in the central metallic island is sufficiently large. Using
the master equation, the current, the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), and the
current noise spectrum have been calculated for devices of different
parameters. It was shown that the interplay between spin and charge
correlations strongly depends on the asymmetry of measured device. The charge
correlation makes both the chemical potential shift, which describes the spin
accumulation in the central island, and the TMR oscillated with the same period
as the Coulomb staircase in current-voltage characteristics. This effect is
smeared by the temperature. The spin correlation may cause an enhancement of
noise at finite frequencies, while the zero frequency noise is still always
sub-poissonian. The gate voltage causes an oscillation of not only conductance,
but also TMR and noise.",2007-01-06T07:32:19Z
"Numerical study of drying process and columnar fracture process in
  granules-water mixtures","The formation of three-dimensional prismatic cracks in the drying process of
starch-water mixtures is investigated numerically. We assume that the mixture
is an elastic porous medium which possesses a stress field and a water content
field. The evolution of both fields are represented by a spring network and a
phenomenological model with the water potential, respectively. We find that the
water content distribution has a propagating front which is not explained by a
simple diffusion process. The prismatic structure of cracks driven by the water
content field is observed. The depth dependence and the coarsening process of
the columnar structure are also studied. The particle diameter dependence of
the scale of the columns and the effect of the crack networks on the dynamics
of the water content field are also discussed.",2007-02-05T00:07:17Z
"Properties of the Two-Dimensional Electron Gas Close to the Fermi-Liquid
  Quantum Critical Point","The rearrangement of single-particle degrees of freedom of a dilute
two-dimensional electron gas in the vicinity of the quantum critical point is
examined within a microscopic approach. It is shown that just beyond the
critical point, the Landau state undergoes self-consistent rearrangement of the
quasiparticle spectrum and momentum distribution. At very low temperatures,
there emerges a multi-connected quasiparticle momentum distribution. With
increasing temperature, two crossovers occur: a fermion condensate appears in
the first and disappears in the second, giving way to universal
non-Fermi-liquid behavior. Manifestations of these crossovers in thermodynamic
properties of the electron gas are studied and characterized. The four
quasiparticle phases predicted to exist in the vicinity of the critical point
are collected in a schematic phase diagram.",2007-03-18T19:59:26Z
"Coexistence of long-ranged charge and orbital order and spin-glass state
  in single-layered manganites with weak quenched disorder","The relationship between orbital and spin degrees of freedom in the
single-crystals of the hole-doped Pr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{1+x}$MnO$_4$, 0.3 $\leq$ $x$
$\leq$ 0.7, has been investigated by means of ac-magnetometry and charge
transport. Even though there is no cation ordering on the $A$-site, the
quenched disorder is extremely weak in this system due to the very similar
ionic size of Pr$^{3+}$ and Ca$^{2+}$. A clear asymmetric response of the
system to the under- (respective over-) hole doping was observed. The
long-ranged charge-orbital order established for half doping ($x$=0.5) subsists
in the over-doping case ($x$ $>$ 0.5), albeit rearranged to accommodate the
extra holes introduced in the structure. The charge-orbital order is however
destabilized by the presence of extra localized electrons (under-doping, $x$
$<$ 0.5), leading to its disappearance below $x$=0.35. We show that in an
intermediate under-doped region, with 0.35 $\leq$ $x$ $<$ 0.5, the
``orbital-master spin-slave'' relationship commonly observed in half-doped
manganites does not take place. The long-ranged charge-orbital order is not
accompanied by an antiferromagnetic transition at low temperatures, but by a
frustrated short-ranged magnetic state bringing forth a spin-glass phase. We
discuss in detail the nature and origin of this spin-glass state, which, as in
the half-doped manganites with large quenched disorder, is not related to the
macroscopic phase separation observed in crystals with minor defects or
impurities.",2007-01-10T08:29:27Z
"Universal phase shift and non-exponential decay of driven single-spin
  oscillations","We study, both theoretically and experimentally, driven Rabi oscillations of
a single electron spin coupled to a nuclear spin bath. Due to the long
correlation time of the bath, two unusual features are observed in the
oscillations. The decay follows a power law, and the oscillations are shifted
in phase by a universal value of ~pi/4. These properties are well understood
from a theoretical expression that we derive here in the static limit for the
nuclear bath. This improved understanding of the coupled electron-nuclear
system is important for future experiments using the electron spin as a qubit.",2007-03-24T17:21:44Z
Spin Hall Effect For Anyons,"We explain the intrinsic spin Hall effect from generic anyon dynamics in the

Loop Calculus and Belief Propagation for q-ary Alphabet: Loop Tower,"Loop Calculus introduced in [Chertkov, Chernyak '06] constitutes a new
theoretical tool that explicitly expresses the symbol Maximum-A-Posteriori
(MAP) solution of a general statistical inference problem via a solution of the
Belief Propagation (BP) equations. This finding brought a new significance to
the BP concept, which in the past was thought of as just a loop-free
approximation. In this paper we continue a discussion of the Loop Calculus. We
introduce an invariant formulation which allows to generalize the Loop Calculus
approach to a q-are alphabet.",2007-01-12T23:55:51Z
Scaling of resistivities and guided vortex motion in MgB2 thin films,"Longitudinal and transverse voltages have been measured on thin films of MgB2
with different superconducting transition widths. The study has been performed
in zero and non-zero external magnetic fields. The non-zero transverse voltage
has been observed in close vicinity of the critical temperature in zero
external magnetic field, while further away from Tc this voltage becomes zero.
In magnetic field it becomes a transverse voltage which is an even function
with respect to the direction of the field. The usual Hall voltage starts to
appear with increasing magnetic field and in large fields the even voltage
disappears and only the Hall voltage is measurable (i.e. the transverse even
voltage is suppressed with increasing magnetic field and increasing transport
current). New scaling between transverse and longitudinal resistivities has
been observed. This correlation is valid not only in the zero magnetic field
but also in nonzero magnetic field where transverse even voltage is detected.
Several models trying to explain observed results are discussed. The most
promising one seems to be guided motion of the vortices, though further
theoretical work will be required to confirm this.",2007-01-31T13:11:54Z
A Note on Approximate Nearest Neighbor Methods,"A number of authors have described randomized algorithms for solving the
epsilon-approximate nearest neighbor problem. In this note I point out that the
epsilon-approximate nearest neighbor property often fails to be a useful
approximation property, since epsilon-approximate solutions fail to satisfy the
necessary preconditions for using nearest neighbors for classification and
related tasks.",2007-03-21T20:47:33Z
"Polymerisation Degree and Raman Identification of Ancient Glasses used
  for Jewellery, Ceramics Enamels and Mosaics","We demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy as a technique for the
identification of ancient glasses and enamel coatings of ceramics. As for any
silicate glasses, the addition of network modifiers breaks the Si-O linkages
and modifies the degree of polymerisation and hence the relative intensity of
the Si-O bending and stretching modes. We demonstrate empirically that the
ratio of these envelopes is well correlated to the glass structure and to the
used firing technology. Spectral Qn components assigned to isolated and
connected SiO4 vibrational units allow more precise analysis. Selected
porcelains, faiences, potteries and glasses representative of the different
Asian, Islamic and European production technologies were studied. Modern
porcelain enamels are used as compositional references.",2007-01-17T14:19:44Z
Transport of interface states in the Heisenberg chain,"We demonstrate the transport of interface states in the one-dimensional
ferromagnetic Heisenberg model by a time dependent magnetic field. Our analysis
is based on the standard Adiabatic Theorem. This is supplemented by a numerical
analysis via the recently developed time dependent DMRG method, where we
calculate the adiabatic constant as a function of the strength of the magnetic
field and the anisotropy of the interaction.",2007-02-02T23:16:00Z
Ab initio study on the effects of transition metal doping of Mg2NiH4,"Mg2NiH4 is a promising hydrogen storage material with fast (de)hydrogenation
kinetics. Its hydrogen desorption enthalpy, however, is too large for practical
applications. In this paper we study the effects of transition metal doping by
first-principles density functional theory calculations. We show that the
hydrogen desorption enthalpy can be reduced by ~0.1 eV/H2 if one in eight Ni
atoms is replaced by Cu or Fe. Replacing Ni by Co atoms, however, increases the
hydrogen desorption enthalpy. We study the thermodynamic stability of the
dopants in the hydrogenated and dehydrogenated phases. Doping with Co or Cu
leads to marginally stable compounds, whereas doping with Fe leads to an
unstable compound. The optical response of Mg2NiH4 is also substantially
affected by doping. The optical gap in Mg2NiH4 is ~1.7 eV. Doping with Co, Fe
or Cu leads to impurity bands that reduce the optical gap by up to 0.5 eV.",2007-03-21T13:36:25Z
"The Shear Viscosity to Entropy Density Ratio of Trapped Fermions in the
  Unitarity Limit","We extract the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio \eta/s of cold
fermionic atoms in the unitarity limit from experimental data on the damping of
collective excitations. We find that near the critical temperature \eta/s is
roughly equal to 1/2 in units of \hbar/k_B. With the possible exception of the
quark gluon plasma, this value is closer to the conjectured lower bound
1/(4\pi) than any other known liquid.",2007-01-11T18:37:48Z
Quantum Impurity Entanglement,"Entanglement in J_1-J_2, S=1/2 quantum spin chains with an impurity is
studied using analytic methods as well as large scale numerical density matrix
renormalization group methods. The entanglement is investigated in terms of the
von Neumann entropy, S=-Tr rho_A log rho_A, for a sub-system A of size r of the
chain. The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement
entropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_2 <=
J_2^c, as well as the dimerized phase, J_2>J_2^c, of the model. This quantum
impurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model
and it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in
the gapless phase, J_2 <= J_2^c, gives rise to a large length scale, xi_K,
associated with the screening of the impurity, the size of the Kondo screening
cloud. The universality of Kondo physics then implies scaling of the form
S_{imp}(r/xi_K,r/R) for a system of size R. Numerical results are presented
clearly demonstrating this scaling. At the critical point, J_2^c, an analytic
Fermi liquid picture is developed and analytic results are obtained both at T=0
and T>0. In the dimerized phase an appealing picure of the entanglement is
developed in terms of a thin soliton (TS) ansatz and the notions of impurity
valence bonds (IVB) and single particle entanglement (SPE) are introduced. The
TS-ansatz permits a variational calculation of the complete entanglement in the
dimerized phase that appears to be exact in the thermodynamic limit at the
Majumdar-Ghosh point, J_2=J_1/2, and surprisingly precise even close to the
critical point J_2^c. In appendices the relation between the finite temperature
entanglement entropy, S(T), and the thermal entropy, S_{th}(T), is discussed
and <S^z_r> and <S_r S_{r+1}> calculated at the MG-point using the TS-ansatz.",2007-03-02T03:55:42Z
Spinodal decomposition in polarised Fermi superfluids,"We discuss the dynamics of phase separation through the process of spinodal
decomposition in a Fermi superfluid with population imbalance. We discuss this
instability first in terms of a phenomenological Landau theory. Working within
the mean-field description at zero temperature, we then find the spinodal
region in the phase diagram of polarisation versus interaction strength, and
the spectrum of unstable modes in this region. After a quench, the spinodal
decomposition starts from the Sarma state, which is a minimum of the free
energy with respect to the order parameter at fixed density and polarisation
and a maximum at fixed chemical potentials. The possibility of observing
non-trivial domain structures in current experiments with trapped atomic gases
is discussed.",2007-01-28T17:37:06Z
"Confrontation of MOND with the rotation curves of early-type disc
  galaxies","We extend the MOND analysis to a sample of 17 high surface brightness,
early-type disc galaxies with rotation curves derived from a combination of
21cm HI line observations and optical spectroscopic data. A number of these
galaxies have asymptotic rotation velocities between 250 and 350 km/s making
them among the most massive systems (in terms of baryonic mass) considered in
the context of MOND. We find that the general MOND prediction for such galaxies
-- a rotation curve which gradually declines to the asymptotic value -- is
confirmed, and in most cases the MOND rotation curve, determined from the mean
radial light and gas distribution, agrees in detail with the observed rotation
curve. In the few cases where MOND appears not to work well, the discrepancies
can generally be understood in terms of various observational errors -- such as
incorrect orientation angles and/or distances -- or of unmodelled physical
effects -- such as non-circular motions. The implied mass-to-light ratios for
the stellar disc and bulge constrain the MOND interpolating function; the form
recently suggested by Zhao & Famaey (2005) yields more sensible values than the
one traditionally used in MOND determinations of galaxy rotation curves.",2007-03-14T10:52:51Z
"Comment on ``Nonlinear band structure in Bose-Einstein condensates:
  Nonlinear Schödinger equation with a Kronig Penney potential""","In their recent paper [Phys. Rev. A 71, 033622], B. T. Seaman et al. studied
Bloch states of the condensate wave function in a Kronig-Penney potential and
calculated the band structure. They argued that the effective mass is always
positive when a swallow-tail energy loop is present in the band structure. In
this comment, we reexamine their argument by actually calculating the effective
mass. It is found that there exists a region where the effective mass is
negative even when a swallow-tail is present. Based on this fact, we discuss
the interpretation of swallow-tails in terms of superfluidity.",2007-03-02T00:14:52Z
Surface Nucleation in the Freezing of Gold Nanoparticles,"We use molecular simulation to calculate the nucleation free energy barrier
for the freezing of a 456 atom gold cluster over a range of temperatures. The
results show that the embryo of the solid cluster grows at the vapor-surface
interface for all temperatures studied and that the usual classical nucleation
model, with the embryo growing in the core of the cluster, is unable to predict
the shape of the free energy barrier. We use a simple partial wetting model
that treats the crystal as a lens shaped nucleus at the liquid-vapor interface
and find that the line tension plays an important role in the freezing of gold
nanoparticles.",2007-02-26T16:27:21Z
"Weak binding between two aromatic rings: feeling the van der Waals
  attraction by quantum Monte Carlo methods","We report a systematic study of the weak chemical bond between two benzene
molecules. We first show that it is possible to obtain a very good description
of the C_2 dimer and the benzene molecule, by using pseudopotentials for the
chemically inert 1s electrons, and a resonating valence bond wave function as a
variational ansatz, expanded on a relatively small Gaussian basis set. We
employ an improved version of the stochastic reconfiguration technique to
optimize the many-body wave function, which is the starting point for highly
accurate simulations based on the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo
(LRDMC) method. This projection technique provides a rigorous variational upper
bound for the total energy, even in the presence of pseudopotentials, and
allows to improve systematically the accuracy of the trial wave function, which
already yields a large fraction of the dynamical and non-dynamical electron
correlation. We show that the energy dispersion of two benzene molecules in the
parallel displaced geometry is significantly deeper than the face-to-face
configuration. However, contrary to previous studies based on post Hartree-Fock
methods, the binding energy remains weak (~ 2 kcal/mol) also in this geometry,
and its value is in agreement with the most accurate and recent experimental
findings.",2007-02-15T02:08:23Z
"Semiclassical dynamics and long time asymptotics of the central-spin
  problem in a quantum dot","The spin of an electron trapped in a quantum dot is a promising candidate
implementation of a qubit for quantum information processing. We study the
central spin problem of the effect of the hyperfine interaction between such an
electron and a large number of nuclear moments. Using a spin coherent path
integral, we show that in this limit the electron spin evolution is well
described by classical dynamics of both the nuclear and electron spins. We then
introduce approximate yet systematic methods to analyze aspects of the
classical dynamics, and discuss the importance of the exact integrability of
the central spin Hamiltonian. This is compared with numerical simulation.
Finally, we obtain the asymptotic long time decay of the electron spin
polarization. We show that this is insensitive to integrability, and determined
instead by the transfer of angular momentum to very weakly coupled spins far
from the center of the quantum dot. The specific form of the decay is shown to
depend sensitively on the form of the electronic wavefunction.",2007-03-23T20:00:01Z
"A theorem on the quantum evaluation of Weight Enumerators for a certain
  class of Cyclic Codes with a note on Cyclotomic cosets","This note is a stripped down version of a published paper on the Potts
partition function, where we concentrate solely on the linear coding aspect of
our approach. It is meant as a resource for people interested in coding theory
but who do not know much of the mathematics involved and how quantum
computation may provide a speed up in the computation of a very important
quantity in coding theory. We provide a theorem on the quantum computation of
the Weight Enumerator polynomial for a restricted family of cyclic codes. The
complexity of obtaining an exact evaluation is $O(k^{2s}(\log q)^{2})$, where
$s$ is a parameter which determines the class of cyclic codes in question, $q$
is the characteristic of the finite field over which the code is defined, and
$k$ is the dimension of the code. We also provide an overview of cyclotomic
cosets and discuss applications including how they can be used to speed up the
computation of the weight enumerator polynomial (which is related to the Potts
partition function). We also give an algorithm which returns the coset leaders
and the size of each coset from the list $\{0,1,2,...,N-1\}$, whose time
complexity is soft-O(N). This algorithm uses standard techniques but we include
it as a resource for students. Note that cyclotomic cosets do not improve the
asymptotic complexity of the computation of weight enumerators.",2007-03-26T07:17:50Z
Single Wall Carbon Nanotube Weak Links,"We have reproducibly contacted gated single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) to
superconducting leads based on niobium. The devices are identified to belong to
two transparency regimes: The Coulomb blockade and the Kondo regime. Clear
signature of the superconducting leads is observed in both regimes and in the
Kondo regime a narrow zero bias peak interpreted as a proximity induced
supercurrent persist in Coulomb blockade diamonds with Kondo resonances.",2007-03-13T16:23:24Z
"A Case Study of Sedimentation of Charged Colloids: The Primitive Model
  and the Effective One-Component Approach","Sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium density profiles of suspensions of
charge-stabilized colloids are calculated theoretically and by Monte Carlo
simulation, both for a one-component model of colloidal particles interacting
through pairwise screened-Coulomb repulsions and for a three-component model of
colloids, cations, and anions with unscreened-Coulomb interactions. We focus on
a state point for which experimental measurements are available [C.P. Royall et
al., J. Phys.: Cond. Matt. {\bf 17}, 2315 (2005)]. Despite the apparently
different picture that emerges from the one- and three-component model
(repelling colloids pushing each other to high altitude in the former, versus a
self-generated electric field that pushes the colloids up in the latter), we
find similar colloidal density profiles for both models from theory as well as
simulation, thereby suggesting that these pictures represent different view
points of the same phenomenon. The sedimentation profiles obtained from an
effective one-component model by MC simulations and theory, together with MC
simulations of the multi-component primitive model are consistent among
themselves, but differ quantitatively from the results of a theoretical
multi-component description at the Poisson-Boltzmann level. We find that for
small and moderate colloid charge the Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives profiles
in excellent agreement with the effective one-component theory if a smaller
effective charge is used. We attribute this discrepancy to the poor treatment
of correlations in the Poisson-Boltzmann theory.",2007-02-16T10:22:58Z
"Spin densities in parabolic quantum wires with Rashba spin-orbit
  interaction","Using canonical transformations we diagonalize approximately the Hamiltonian
of a gaussian wire with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. This proceedure allows
us to obtain the energy dispersion relations and the wavefunctions with good
accuracy, even in systems with relatively strong Rashba coupling. With these
eigenstates one can calculate the non-equilibrium spin densities induced by
applying bias voltages across the sample. We focus on the $z$-component of the
spin density, which is related to the spin Hall effect.",2007-01-23T18:13:49Z
"Data Management: Past, Present, and Future","Soon most information will be available at your fingertips, anytime,
anywhere. Rapid advances in storage, communications, and processing allow us
move all information into Cyberspace. Software to define, search, and visualize
online information is also a key to creating and accessing online information.
This article traces the evolution of data management systems and outlines
current trends. Data management systems began by automating traditional tasks:
recording transactions in business, science, and commerce. This data consisted
primarily of numbers and character strings. Today these systems provide the
infrastructure for much of our society, allowing fast, reliable, secure, and
automatic access to data distributed throughout the world. Increasingly these
systems automatically design and manage access to the data. The next steps are
to automate access to richer forms of data: images, sound, video, maps, and
other media. A second major challenge is automatically summarizing and
abstracting data in anticipation of user requests. These multi-media databases
and tools to access them will be a cornerstone of our move to Cyberspace.",2007-01-25T22:42:28Z
Universal Extremal Statistics in a Freely Expanding Jepsen Gas,"We study the extremal dynamics emerging in an out-of-equilibrium
one-dimensional Jepsen gas of $(N+1)$ hard-point particles. The particles
undergo binary elastic collisions, but move ballistically in-between
collisions. The gas is initally uniformly distributed in a box $[-L,0]$ with
the ""leader"" (or the rightmost particle) at X=0, and a random positive
velocity, independently drawn from a distribution $\phi(V)$, is assigned to
each particle. The gas expands freely at subsequent times. We compute
analytically the distribution of the leader's velocity at time $t$, and also
the mean and the variance of the number of collisions that are undergone by the
leader up to time $t$. We show that in the thermodynamic limit and at fixed
time $t\gg 1$ (the so-called ""growing regime""), when interactions are strongly
manifest, the velocity distribution exhibits universal scaling behavior of only
three possible varieties, depending on the tail of $\phi(V)$. The associated
scaling functions are novel and different from the usual extreme-value
distributions of uncorrelated random variables. In this growing regime the mean
and the variance of the number of collisions of the leader up to time $t$
increase logarithmically with $t$, with universal prefactors that are computed
exactly. The implications of our results in the context of biological evolution
modeling are pointed out.",2007-01-07T13:10:31Z
"A statistical mechanics approach for scale-free networks and
  finite-scale networks","We present a statistical mechanics approach for the description of complex
networks. We first define an energy and an entropy associated to a degree
distribution which have a geometrical interpretation. Next we evaluate the
distribution which extremize the free energy of the network. We find two
important limiting cases: a scale-free degree distribution and a finite-scale
degree distribution. The size of the space of allowed simple networks given
these distribution is evaluated in the large network limit. Results are
compared with simulations of algorithms generating these networks.",2007-03-07T18:31:10Z
"Theory of electron-phonon interaction in a nonequilibrium open
  electronic system","We study the effects of time-independent nonequilibrium drive on an open 2D
electron gas system coupled to 2D longitudinal acoustic phonons using the
Keldysh path integral method. The layer electron-phonon system is defined at
the two-dimensional interface between a pair of three-dimensional Fermi liquid
leads, which act both as a particle pump and an infinite bath. The
nonequilibrium steady state is achieved in the layer by assuming the leads to
be thermally equilibrated at two different chemical potentials. This subjects
the layer to an out-of-plane voltage $V$ and drives a steady-state charge
current perpendicular to the system. We compute the effects of small voltages
($V\ll\w_D$) on the in-plane electron-phonon scattering rate and the electron
effective mass at zero temperature. We also find that the obtained
onequilibrium modification to the acoustic phonon velocity and the Thomas-Fermi
screening length reveal the possibility of tuning these quantities with the
external voltage.",2007-03-08T21:00:58Z
"Spin Configurations and Activation Gaps of the Quantum Hall States in
  Graphene","We report on our accurate evaluation of spin polarizations of the ground
state and particle-hole gaps for partially-filled lowest Landau level, observed
in recent experiments on graphene subjected to ultra-high magnetic fields. We
find that inter-electron interactions are important at these filling factors,
characterized by the non-degenerate ground states and large particle-hole gaps
at infinitely large wave vectors. The gaps are the largest for the quantum Hall
states in the second Landau level. The weak appearance of quantum Hall plateaus
in the experiments for certain filling factors in the second Landau level
however indicates that at these filling factors, the system has a soft mode at
a finite wave vector due presumably to the presence of disorder.",2007-03-21T04:33:18Z
Intrinsic dimension of a dataset: what properties does one expect?,"We propose an axiomatic approach to the concept of an intrinsic dimension of
a dataset, based on a viewpoint of geometry of high-dimensional structures. Our
first axiom postulates that high values of dimension be indicative of the
presence of the curse of dimensionality (in a certain precise mathematical
sense). The second axiom requires the dimension to depend smoothly on a
distance between datasets (so that the dimension of a dataset and that of an
approximating principal manifold would be close to each other). The third axiom
is a normalization condition: the dimension of the Euclidean $n$-sphere $\s^n$
is $\Theta(n)$. We give an example of a dimension function satisfying our
axioms, even though it is in general computationally unfeasible, and discuss a
computationally cheap function satisfying most but not all of our axioms (the
``intrinsic dimensionality'' of Ch\'avez et al.)",2007-03-25T01:19:14Z
"General relativistic simulations of pasive-magneto-rotational core
  collapse with microphysics","This paper presents results from axisymmetric simulations of
magneto-rotational stellar core collapse to neutron stars in general relativity
using the passive field approximation for the magnetic field. These simulations
are performed using a new general relativistic numerical code specifically
designed to study this astrophysical scenario. The code is based on the
conformally-flat approximation of Einstein's field equations and conservative
formulations of the magneto-hydrodynamics equations. The code has been recently
upgraded to incorporate a tabulated, microphysical equation of state and an
approximate deleptonization scheme. This allows us to perform the most
realistic simulations of magneto-rotational core collapse to date, which are
compared with simulations employing a simplified (hybrid) equation of state,
widely used in the relativistic core collapse community. Furthermore,
state-of-the-art (unmagnetized) initial models from stellar evolution are used.
In general, stellar evolution models predict weak magnetic fields in the
progenitors, which justifies our simplification of performing the computations
under the approach that we call the passive field approximation for the
magnetic field. Our results show that for the core collapse models with
microphysics the saturation of the magnetic field cannot be reached within
dynamical time scales by winding up the poloidal magnetic field into a toroidal
one. We estimate the effect of other amplification mechanisms including the
magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and several types of dynamos.",2007-03-22T20:21:17Z
Full Potential Multiple Scattering for X-ray Spectroscopies,"We present a Full Potential Multiple Scattering (FP-MS) scheme for the
interpretation of several X-ray spectroscopies that is a straightforward
generalization of the more conventional Muffin-Tin (MT) version. Like this
latter, it preserves the intuitive description of the physical process under
consideration and overcomes some of the limitations of the existing FP-MS
codes. It hinges on a fast and efficient method for solving the single cell
scattering problem that avoids the convergence drawbacks of the angular
momentum (AM) expansion of the cell shape function and relies on an alternative
derivation of the multiple scattering equations (MSE) that allows us to work
reliably with only one truncation parameter, {\it i.e.} the number of local
basis functions in the expansion of the global scattering function determined
by the classical relation $l_{\rm max} \sim k R$.",2007-02-22T19:56:11Z
Are Swift gamma-ray bursts consistent with the Ghirlanda relation?,"A few tight correlations linking several properties of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs), namely the spectral peak energy, the total radiated energy, and the
afterglow break time, have been discovered with pre-Swift GRBs. They were used
to constrain the cosmological parameters, together with type-Ia supernovae.
However, the tightness of these correlations is a challenge to GRB models. We
explore the effect of adding Swift bursts to the Ghirlanda and Liang-Zhang
relations. Although they are both still valid, they become somewhat weakened
mostly due to the presence of significant outliers, which otherwise are
apparently normal GRBs so difficult to distinguish. The increased dispersion of
the relations makes them less reliable for purposes of precision cosmology.",2007-03-27T09:33:14Z
The electronic structure and the phases of BaVS3,"BaVS3 is a moderately correlated d-electron system with a rich phase diagram.
To construct the corresponding minimal electronic model, one has to decide
which d-states are occupied, and to which extent. The ARPES experiment
presented here shows that the behavior of BaVS3 is governed by the coexistence
of wide-band (A_1g) and narrow-band (twofold degenerate E) d-electrons. We
sketch a lattice fermion model which may serve as a minimal model of BaVS3.
This serves foremost for the understanding of the metal-insulator in pure BaVS3
and its absence in some related compounds. The nature of the low temperature
magnetic order differs for several systems which may be described in terms of
the same electron model. We describe several recent experiments which give
information about magnetic order at high pressures. In particular, we discuss
field-induced insulator-to-metal transition at slightly subcritical pressures,
and an evidence for magnetic order in the high-pressure metallic phase. The
phase diagram of Sr-doped BaVS3 is also discussed. The complexity of the phases
of BaVS3 arises from the fact that it is simultaneously unstable against
several kinds of instabilities.",2007-02-22T02:43:13Z
Room-Temperature Quantum Hall Effect in Graphene,"The quantum Hall effect (QHE), one example of a quantum phenomenon that occur
on a truly macroscopic scale, has been attracting intense interest since its
discovery in 1980 and has helped elucidate many important aspects of quantum
physics. It has also led to the establishment of a new metrological standard,
the resistance quantum. Disappointingly, however, the QHE could only have been
observed at liquid-helium temperatures. Here, we show that in graphene - a
single atomic layer of carbon - the QHE can reliably be measured even at room
temperature, which is not only surprising and inspirational but also promises
QHE resistance standards becoming available to a broader community, outside a
few national institutions.",2007-02-17T11:28:10Z
Finding long cycles in graphs,"We analyze the problem of discovering long cycles inside a graph. We propose
and test two algorithms for this task. The first one is based on recent
advances in statistical mechanics and relies on a message passing procedure.
The second follows a more standard Monte Carlo Markov Chain strategy. Special
attention is devoted to Hamiltonian cycles of (non-regular) random graphs of
minimal connectivity equal to three.",2007-02-26T20:33:20Z
"Magnetic-field-induced spin excitations and renormalized spin gap of the
  underdoped superconductor La$_{1.895}$Sr$_{0.105}$CuO$_{4}$","High-resolution neutron inelastic scattering experiments in applied magnetic
fields have been performed on La$_{1.895}$Sr$_{0.105}$CuO$_{4}$ (LSCO). In zero
field, the temperature dependence of the low-energy peak intensity at the
incommensurate momentum-transfer $\mathbf{Q}^{\
}_{\mathrm{IC}}=(0.5,0.5\pm\delta,0),(0.5\pm\delta,0.5,0)$ exhibits an anomaly
at the superconducting $T^{\}_{c}$ which broadens and shifts to lower
temperature upon the application of a magnetic field along the c-axis. A
field-induced enhancement of the spectral weight is observed, but only at
finite energy transfers and in an intermediate temperature range. These
observations establish the opening of a strongly downward renormalized spin gap
in the underdoped regime of LSCO. This behavior contrasts with the observed
doping dependence of most electronic energy features.",2007-01-17T10:34:04Z
Fluctuations of Quantum Currents and Unravelings of Master Equations,"The very notion of a current fluctuation is problematic in the quantum
context. We study that problem in the context of nonequilibrium statistical
mechanics, both in a microscopic setup and in a Markovian model. Our answer is
based on a rigorous result that relates the weak coupling limit of fluctuations
of reservoir observables under a global unitary evolution with the statistics
of the so-called quantum trajectories. These quantum trajectories are
frequently considered in the context of quantum optics, but they remain useful
for more general nonequilibrium systems.
  In contrast with the approaches found in the literature, we do not assume
that the system is continuously monitored. Instead, our starting point is a
relatively realistic unitary dynamics of the full system.",2007-03-23T01:06:34Z
"Insulating charge density wave for a half-filled SU(N) Hubbard model
  with an attractive on-site interaction in one dimension","We study a one-dimensional SU(N) Hubbard model with an attractive on-site
interaction and $N>2$ at half-filling on the bipartite lattice using
density-matrix renormalization-group method and a perturbation theory. We find
that the ground state of the SU(N) Hubbard model is a charge density wave state
with two-fold degeneracy. All the excitations are found to be gapful, resulting
in an insulating ground state, on contrary to that in the SU(2) case. Moreover,
the charge gap is equal to the Cooperon gap, which behaves as $-2Nt^2/(N-1)U$
in the strong coupling regime. However, the spin gap $\Delta_{s}$ and the
quasiparticle gap $\Delta_{1}$ as well open exponentially in the weak coupling
region, while in the strong coupling region, they linearly depend on $U$ such
that $\Delta_{s}\sim -U(N-1)$ and $\Delta_{1}\sim -U(N-1)/2$.",2007-02-26T03:46:31Z
"Sliding and translational diffusion of molecular phases confined into
  nanotubes","The remaining dynamical degrees of freedom of molecular fluids confined into
capillaries of nano to sub-nanometer diameter are of fundamental relevance for
future developments in the field of nanofluidics. These properties cannot be
simply deduced from the bulk one since the derivation of macroscopic
hydrodynamics most usually breaks down in nanoporous channels and additional
effects have to be considered. In the present contribution, we review some
general phenomena, which are expected to occur when manipulating fluids under
confinement and ultraconfinement conditions.",2007-03-15T16:54:53Z
Anomalous electric conductions in KSbO3-type metallic rhenium oxides,"Single crystals of KSbO3-type rhenium oxides, La4Re6O$19, Pb6Re6O19, Sr2Re3O9
and Bi3Re3O11, were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Their crystal
structures can be regarded as a network of three-dimensional orthogonal-dimer
lattice of edge-shared ReO6 octahedra. All of them exhibit small magnitude of
Pauli paramagnetism, indicating metallic electronic states without strong
electron correlations. The resistivity of these rhenates, except Bi3Re3O11,
have a temperature dependence of $rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}$ $(n \approx 1.6)$ in
a wide temperature range between 5 K and 300 K, which is extraordinary for
three-dimensional metals without strong electron correlations. The resistivity
of Bi3Re3O11 shows an anomaly around at 50 K, where the magnetic susceptibility
also detects a deviation from ordinary Pauli paramagnetism.",2007-02-20T05:29:24Z
"Spin and rotational symmetries in unrestricted Hartree Fock states of
  quantum dots","Ground state energies are obtained using the unrestricted Hartree Fock method
for up to four interacting electrons parabolically confined in a quantum dot
subject to a magnetic field. Restoring spin and rotational symmetries we
recover Hund first rule. With increasing magnetic field, crossovers between
ground states with different quantum numbers are found for fixed electron
number that are not reproduced by the unrestricted Hartree Fock approximation.
These are consistent with the ones obtained with more refined techniques. We
confirm the presence of a spin blockade due to a spin mismatch in the ground
states of three and four electrons.",2007-03-14T16:19:48Z
Resolving the B[e] star Hen 3-1191 at 10 microns with VLTI/MIDI,"We report spatially resolved, spectrally dispersed N-band observations of the
B[e] star Hen 3-1191 with the MIDI instrument of the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer. The object is resolved with a 40 m baseline and has an
equivalent uniform disc diameter ranging from 24 mas at 8 microns to 36 mas at
13 microns. The MIDI spectrum and visibilities show a curvature which can arise
from a weak silicate feature in which the object appears ~ 15% larger than in
the continuum, but this could result from a change in the object's geometry
within the band.
  We then model Hen's 3-1191 spectral energy distribution (.4-60 microns) and
N-band visibilities. Because of the unknown nature for the object, we use a
wide variety of models for objects with IR excesses. We find the observations
to be consistent with a disc featuring an unusually high mass accretion and a
large central gap almost void of matter, an excretion disc, and a binary made
of two IR sources. We are unable to find a circumstellar shell model consistent
with the data.
  At last, we review the different hypotheses concerning the physical nature of
the star and conclude that it is neither a Be supergiant nor a symbiotic star.
However, we could not discriminate between the scenario of a young stellar
object featuring an unusually strong FU Orionis-like outburst of mass accretion
(4 to 250 x 10^-4 solar mass per year) and that of a protoplanetary nebula with
an equatorial mass excretion rate (>~ 4 x 10^-5 solar mass per year). In both
cases, taking the additional presence of an envelope or wind into account would
result in lower mass flows.",2007-03-28T17:54:57Z
A dark energy multiverse,"We present cosmic solutions corresponding to universes filled with dark and
phantom energy, all having a negative cosmological constant. All such solutions
contain infinite singularities, successively and equally distributed along
time, which can be either big bang/crunchs or big rips singularities.
Classicaly these solutions can be regarded as associated with multiverse
scenarios, being those corresponding to phantom energy that may describe the
current accelerating universe.",2007-01-23T22:16:00Z
"Nearly Divergence of Correlation Length and Perturbation Spectrum in
  String Gas Cosmology","Recently, it has been shown in Ref.[1] that the string thermodynamic
fluctuation may lead to a scale invariant spectrum of scalar metric
perturbation. However, its realization is still in study. In this note we
suppose that the correlation length of metric perturbation, which is
proportional to the sound speed, might be nearly divergent at the critical
point of phase transition. In this case we find that the string gas mechanism
responsible for the generation of primordial perturbation may be applied well.",2007-02-02T07:00:32Z
"Field-Sensitive Value Analysis of Embedded C Programs with Union Types
  and Pointer Arithmetics","We propose a memory abstraction able to lift existing numerical static
analyses to C programs containing union types, pointer casts, and arbitrary
pointer arithmetics. Our framework is that of a combined points-to and
data-value analysis. We abstract the contents of compound variables in a
field-sensitive way, whether these fields contain numeric or pointer values,
and use stock numerical abstract domains to find an overapproximation of all
possible memory states--with the ability to discover relationships between
variables. A main novelty of our approach is the dynamic mapping scheme we use
to associate a flat collection of abstract cells of scalar type to the set of
accessed memory locations, while taking care of byte-level aliases - i.e., C
variables with incompatible types allocated in overlapping memory locations. We
do not rely on static type information which can be misleading in C programs as
it does not account for all the uses a memory zone may be put to. Our work was
incorporated within the Astr\'{e}e static analyzer that checks for the absence
of run-time-errors in embedded, safety-critical, numerical-intensive software.
It replaces the former memory domain limited to well-typed, union-free,
pointer-cast free data-structures. Early results demonstrate that this
abstraction allows analyzing a larger class of C programs, without much cost

  model","We report results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Bose-Hubbard
model in three dimensions. Critical parameters for the
superfluid-to-Mott-insulator transition are determined with significantly
higher accuracy than it has been done in the past. In particular, the position
of the critical point at filling factor n=1 is found to be at (U/t)_c =
29.34(2), and the insulating gap Delta is measured with accuracy of a few
percent of the hopping amplitude t. We obtain the effective mass of particle
and hole excitations in the insulating state--with explicit demonstration of
the emerging particle-hole symmetry and relativistic dispersion law at the
transition tip--along with the sound velocity in the strongly correlated
superfluid phase. These parameters are the necessary ingredients to perform
analytic estimates of the low temperature (T << Delta) thermodynamics in
macroscopic samples. We present accurate thermodynamic curves, including these
for specific heat and entropy, for typical insulating (U/t=40) and superfluid
(t/U=0.0385) phases. Our data can serve as a basis for accurate experimental
thermometry, and a guide for appropriate initial conditions if one attempts to
use interacting bosons in quantum information processing.",2007-01-09T16:38:22Z
Carbon Based Superconductors,"We review the characteristics of some carbon based novel superconductors
which emerged in the past two decades since the discovery of superconductivity
in the high-T_c oxocuprates. In particular, we summarize the properties of
ternary layered carbide halides of the rare rarth metals with composition
RE2C2X2 (RE = Y, La; X=Cl, Br, I) and of the rare earth di- and sesquicarbides,
YC2, LaC2 and La2C3. Finally, we briefly discuss the properties of the recently
discovered Ca and Yb intercalated graphite superconductors, CaC6 and YbC6.",2007-01-29T09:42:15Z
"Condensates of Strongly-interacting Atoms and Dynamically Generated
  Dimers","In a system of atoms with large positive scattering length, weakly-bound
diatomic molecules (dimers) are generated dynamically by the strong
interactions between the atoms. If the atoms are modeled by a quantum field
theory with an atom field only, condensates of dimers cannot be described by
the mean-field approximation because there is no field associated with the
dimers. We develop a method for describing dimer condensates in such a model
based on the one-particle-irreducible (1PI) effective action. We construct an
equivalent 1PI effective action that depends not only on the classical atom
field but also on a classical dimer field. The method is illustrated by
applying it to the many-body behavior of bosonic atoms with large scattering
length at zero temperature using an approximation in which the 2-atom amplitude
is treated exactly but irreducible $N$-atom amplitudes for $N \ge 3$ are
neglected. The two 1PI effective actions give identical results for the atom
superfluid phase, but the one with a classical dimer field is much more
convenient for describing the dimer superfluid phase. The results are also
compared with previous work on the Bose gas near a Feshbach resonance.",2007-03-12T19:34:39Z
Modeling Non-Circular Motions in Disk Galaxies: Application to NGC 2976,"We present a new procedure to fit non-axisymmetric flow patterns to 2-D
velocity maps of spiral galaxies. We concentrate on flows caused by bar-like or
oval distortions to the total potential that may arise either from a
non-axially symmetric halo or a bar in the luminous disk. We apply our method
to high-quality CO and Halpha data for the nearby, low-mass spiral NGC 2976
previously obtained by Simon et al., and find that a bar-like model fits the
data at least as well as their model with large radial flows. We find
supporting evidence for the existence of a bar in the baryonic disk. Our model
suggests that the azimuthally averaged central attraction in the inner part of
this galaxy is larger than estimated by these authors. It is likely that the
disk is also more massive, which will limit the increase to the allowed dark
halo density. Allowance for bar-like distortions in other galaxies may either
increase or decrease the estimated central attraction.",2007-03-27T14:47:51Z
"Spin-orbit induced anisotropy in the tunneling magnetoresistance of
  magnetic tunnel junctions","The effects of the spin-orbit interaction on the tunneling magnetoresistance
of magnetic tunnel junctions are investigated. A model in which the
experimentally observed two-fold symmetry of the anisotropic tunneling
magnetoresistance (TAMR) originates from the interference between Dresselhaus
and Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit couplings is formulated. Bias induced changes of
the Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength can result in an inversion of
the TAMR. The theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the TAMR
experimentally observed in epitaxial Fe/GaAs/Au tunnel junctions.",2007-02-16T11:23:44Z
"Spin and rotational symmetries in unrestricted Hartree Fock states of
  quantum dots","Ground state energies are obtained using the unrestricted Hartree Fock method
for up to four interacting electrons parabolically confined in a quantum dot
subject to a magnetic field. Restoring spin and rotational symmetries we
recover Hund first rule. With increasing magnetic field, crossovers between
ground states with different quantum numbers are found for fixed electron
number that are not reproduced by the unrestricted Hartree Fock approximation.
These are consistent with the ones obtained with more refined techniques. We
confirm the presence of a spin blockade due to a spin mismatch in the ground
states of three and four electrons.",2007-03-14T16:19:48Z
"Comment on ``Spin-glass transition of the three-dimensional Heisenberg
  spin glass''","Campos et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 (2006) 217204] claim that in the 3d
Heisenberg Spin Glass, chiral and spin sector ordering temperatures are
identical. We point out that in their analysis of their numerical data key
assumptions are made which are unjustified.",2007-03-14T16:47:07Z
"Excitable Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton model on scale-free
  networks","We study the excitable Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton model on
scale-free networks. We obtained analytical expressions for no external
stimulus and the uncoupled case. It is found that the curves, the average
activity $F$ versus the external stimulus rate $r$, can be fitted by a Hill
function, but not exactly, and there exists a relation $F\propto r^\alpha$ for
the low-stimulus response, where Stevens-Hill exponent $\alpha$ ranges from
$\alpha = 1$ in the subcritical regime to $\alpha = 0.5$ at criticality. At the
critical point, the range reaches the maximal. We also calculate the average
activity $F^{k}(r)$ and the dynamic range $\Delta^{k}(p)$ for nodes with given
connectivity $k$. It is interesting that nodes with larger connectivity have
larger optimal range, which could be applied in biological experiments to
reveal the network topology.",2007-01-11T15:16:16Z
"Coherent control of interacting electrons in quantum dots via navigation
  in the energy spectrum","Quantum control of the wave function of two interacting electrons confined in
quasi-one-dimensional double-well semiconductor structures is demonstrated. The
control strategies are based on the knowledge of the energy spectrum as a
function of an external uniform electric field. When two low-lying levels have
avoided crossings our system behaves dynamically to a large extent as a
two-level system. This characteristic is exploited to implement coherent
control strategies based on slow (adiabatic passage) and rapid (diabatic
Landau-Zener transition) changes of the external field. We apply this method to
reach desired target states that lie far in the spectrum from the initial
state.",2007-03-07T19:10:04Z
"Statistical methods applied to composition studies of ultrahigh energy
  cosmic rays","The mass composition of high energy cosmic rays above $10^{17}$ eV is a
crucial issue to solve some open questions in astrophysics such as the
acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Unfortunately, the standard procedures
to identify the primary particle of a cosmic ray shower have low efficiency
mainly due to large fluctuations and limited experimental observables. We
present a statistical method for composition studies based on several
measurable features of the longitudinal development of the CR shower such as
$N_{max}$, $X_{max}$, asymmetry, skewness and kurtosis. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the relevance of each parameter in the
representation of the overall shower features and a linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) was used to combine the different parameters to maximize the
discrimination between different particle showers. The new parameter from LDA
provides a separation between primary gammas, proton and iron nuclei better
than the procedures based on $X_{max}$ only. The method proposed here was
successfully tested in the energy range from $10^{17}$ to $10^{20}$ eV even
when limitations of shower track length were included in order to simulate the
field of view of fluorescence telescopes.",2007-03-22T13:26:37Z
Large Merger Recoils and Spin Flips From Generic Black-Hole Binaries,"We report the first results from evolutions of a generic black-hole binary,
i.e. a binary containing unequal mass black holes with misaligned spins. Our
configuration, which has a mass ratio of 2:1, consists of an initially
non-spinning hole orbiting a larger, rapidly spinning hole (specific spin a/m =
0.885), with the spin direction oriented -45 degrees with respect to the
orbital plane. We track the inspiral and merger for ~2 orbits and find that the
remnant receives a substantial kick of 454 km/s, more than twice as large as
the maximum kick from non-spinning binaries. The remnant spin direction is
flipped by 103 degrees with respect to the initial spin direction of the larger
hole. We performed a second run with anti-aligned spins, a/m = +-0.5 lying in
the orbital plane that produces a kick of 1830 km/s off the orbital plane. This
value scales to nearly 4000 km/s for maximally spinning holes. Such a large
recoil velocity opens the possibility that a merged binary can be ejected even
from the nucleus of a massive host galaxy.",2007-01-29T20:50:10Z
Phonon-assisted tunneling regimes in diatomic molecules,"Electronic transport in diatomic molecules (two-level systems) connected to
metallic contacts is analyzed in the presence of competing electron-electron
and electron-phonon interactions. We show that phonon emission and absorption
processes are strongly modified when a Coulomb energy $U$ is included, as the
phonons open channels that can result in destructive or constructive
interference effects. Resonance conditions for these processes produce dramatic
effects both in the density of states at the molecular sites, as well as in the
conductance through the system. We find in particular an enhanced {\it
Rabi-assisted tunneling} due to phonons, as the resonance conditions are met,
which is made more evident for increasing temperatures. These effects are
controllable by voltage gating of the molecular sites, and should be accessible
in current experiments.",2007-01-15T22:12:19Z
"Extreme fluctuations in noisy task-completion landscapes on scale-free
  networks","We study the statistics and scaling of extreme fluctuations in noisy
task-completion landscapes, such as those emerging in synchronized
distributed-computing networks, or generic causally-constrained queuing
networks, with scale-free topology. In these networks the average size of the
fluctuations becomes finite (synchronized state) and the extreme fluctuations
typically diverge only logarithmically in the large system-size limit ensuring
synchronization in a practical sense. Provided that local fluctuations in the
network are short-tailed, the statistics of the extremes are governed by the
Gumbel distribution. We present large-scale simulation results using the exact
algorithmic rules, supported by mean-field arguments based on a coarse-grained
description.",2007-01-13T21:34:30Z
"The multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons:
  Many-body dynamics of bosonic systems","The evolution of Bose-Einstein condensates is amply described by the
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field theory which assumes all bosons to
reside in a single time-dependent one-particle state throughout the propagation
process. In this work, we go beyond mean-field and develop an essentially-exact
many-body theory for the propagation of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger
equation of $N$ interacting identical bosons. In our theory, the time-dependent
many-boson wavefunction is written as a sum of permanents assembled from
orthogonal one-particle functions, or orbitals, where {\it both} the expansion
coefficients {\it and} the permanents (orbitals) themselves are {\it
time-dependent} and fully determined according to a standard time-dependent
variational principle. By employing either the usual Lagrangian formulation or
the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle we arrive at two sets of coupled
equations-of-motion, one for the orbitals and one for the expansion
coefficients. The first set comprises of first-order differential equations in
time and non-linear integro-differential equations in position space, whereas
the second set consists of first-order differential equations with
time-dependent coefficients. We call our theory multi-configurational
time-dependent Hartree for bosons, or MCTDHB($M$), where $M$ specifies the
number of time-dependent orbitals used to construct the permanents. Numerical
implementation of the theory is reported and illustrative numerical examples of
many-body dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates are provided and
discussed.",2007-03-09T02:34:56Z
Ultrafast Enhancement of Ferromagnetism via Photoexcited Holes in GaMnAs,"We report on the observation of ultrafast photo-enhanced ferromagnetism in
GaMnAs. It is manifested as a transient magnetization increase on a 100-ps time
scale, after an initial sub-ps demagnetization. The dynamic magnetization
enhancement exhibits a maximum below the Curie temperature Tc and dominates the
demagnetization component when approaching Tc. We attribute the observed
ultrafast collective ordering to the p-d exchange interaction between
photoexcited holes and Mn spins, leading to a correlation-induced peak around
20K and a transient increase in Tc.",2007-02-19T14:19:26Z
"Non-linear electronic transport and anomalous resistance fluctuations in
  the stripes state of $La_2NiO_{4.14}$","We report on electronic transport measurements in $La_2NiO_{4.14}$. Non-Ohmic
and hysteretic $V(I)$ curves are measured for $T \lesssim$ 220 $K$. Large and
non Gaussian resistance fluctuations can be observed, with strong cooling rate
dependence. During a slow cooling, the resistance reaches plateaus and then
suddenly jumps for $T \lesssim$ 100 $K$, evidencing a macroscopic freezing of
the charges. Anti-correlation between time-series of orthogonal resistances is
also observed. These results are discussed in the framework of the stripes
state scenario.",2007-01-08T10:40:02Z
The numerical renormalization group method for quantum impurity systems,"In the beginning of the 1970's, Wilson developed the concept of a fully
non-perturbative renormalization group transformation. Applied to the Kondo
problem, this numerical renormalization group method (NRG) gave for the first
time the full crossover from the high-temperature phase of a free spin to the
low-temperature phase of a completely screened spin. The NRG has been later
generalized to a variety of quantum impurity problems. The purpose of this
review is to give a brief introduction to the NRG method including some
guidelines of how to calculate physical quantities, and to survey the
development of the NRG method and its various applications over the last 30
years. These applications include variants of the original Kondo problem such
as the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the two-channel Kondo model, dissipative
quantum systems such as the spin-boson model, and lattice systems in the
framework of the dynamical mean field theory.",2007-01-05T14:00:28Z
"Full counting statistics for noninteracting fermions: Exact results and
  the Levitov-Lesovik formula","Exact numerical results for the full counting statistics (FCS) for a
one-dimensional tight-binding model of noninteracting electrons are presented
without using an idealized measuring device. The two initially separate
subsystems are connected at t=0 and the exact time evolution for the large but
finite combined system is obtained numerically. At zero temperature the trace
formula derived by Klich is used to to calculate the FCS via a finite
dimensional determinant. Even for surprisingly short times the approximate
description of the time evolution with the help of scattering states agrees
well with the exact result for the local current matrix elements. An additional
approximation has to be made to recover the Levitov-Lesovik formula in the
limit where the system size becomes infinite and afterwards the long time limit
is addressed. The new derivation of the Levitov-Lesovik formula is generalized
to more general geometries like a Y-junction enclosing a magnetic flux.",2007-01-25T16:03:28Z
"Exciton Ionization, Franz-Keldysh and Stark Effects in Carbon Nanotubes","We calculate the optical properties of carbon nanotubes in an external static
electric field directed along the tube axis. We predict strong Franz-Keldysh
oscillations in the first and second band-to-band absorption peaks, quadratic
Stark effect of the first two excitons, and the field dependence of the bound
exciton ionization rate for a wide range of tube chiralities. We find that the
phonon assisted mechanism dominates the dissociation rate in electro-optical
devices due to the hot optical phonons. We predict a quadratic dependence of
the Sommerfeld factor on the electric field and its increase up to 2000% at the
critical field of the full exciton dissociation.",2007-01-29T22:00:50Z
Annealing Effect for Supersolid Fraction in $^4$He,"We report on experimental confirmation of the non-classical rotational
inertia (NCRI) in solid helium samples originally reported by Kim and Chan. The
onset of NCRI was observed at temperatures below ~400 mK. The ac velocity for
initiation of the NCRI suppression is estimated to be ~10 $\mu$m/sec. After an
additional annealing of the sample at $T= 1.8$ K for 12 hours, ~ 10% relative
increase of NCRI fraction was observed. Then after repeated annealing with the
same conditions, the NCRI fraction was saturated. It differs from Reppy's
observation on a low pressure solid sample.",2007-02-27T11:25:38Z
Inequalities for the Local Energy of Random Ising Models,"We derive a rigorous lower bound on the average local energy for the Ising
model with quenched randomness. The result is that the lower bound is given by
the average local energy calculated in the absence of all interactions other
than the one under consideration. The only condition for this statement to hold
is that the distribution function of the random interaction under consideration
is symmetric. All other interactions can be arbitrarily distributed including
non-random cases. A non-trivial fact is that any introduction of other
interactions to the isolated case always leads to an increase of the average
local energy, which is opposite to ferromagnetic systems where the Griffiths
inequality holds. Another inequality is proved for asymmetrically distributed
interactions. The probability for the thermal average of the local energy to be
lower than that for the isolated case takes a maximum value on the Nishimori
line as a function of the temperature. In this sense the system is most stable
on the Nishimori line.",2007-03-08T14:42:35Z
Time-dependent fields and anisotropy dominated magnetic media,"We use a single dipole approximation to analyze the behavior of
anisotropy-dominated magnetic nanoparticles subjected to an external r.f.
field. We identify the steady state oscillations and analyze their stability.
We also analyze the case when the external r.f. field has a time-dependent
frequency which insures the most effective switching of the magnetization.",2007-03-11T04:52:05Z
Surface imaging of inelastic Friedel oscillations,"Impurities that are present on the surface of a metal often have internal
degrees of freedom. Inelastic scattering due to impurities can be revealed by
observing local features seen in the tunneling current with scanning tunneling
microscope (STM). We consider localized vibrational modes coupled to the
electronic structure of a surface. We argue that vibrational modes of
impurities produce Fermi momentum $k_F$ oscillations in second derivative of
current with respect to voltage $\partial^2I(\br, V)/\partial V^2$. These
oscillations are similar to the well known Friedel oscillations of screening
charge on the surface. We propose to measure inelastic scattering generated by
the presence of the vibrational modes with STM by imaging the
$\partial^2I/\partial V^2$ oscillations on the metal surface.",2007-01-24T23:22:12Z
Quantitative Tube Model for Semiflexible Polymer Solutions,"We develop a analytical and quantitative theory of the tube model concept for
entangled networks of semiflexible polymers. The absolute value of the tube
diameter L_perp is derived as a function of the polymers' persistence length
l_p and mesh size xi of the network. To leading order we find L_\perp = 0.32
xi^{6/5} l_p^{-1/5}, which is consistent with known asymptotic scaling laws.
Additionally, our theory provides corrections to scaling that account for
finite polymer length effects and are dominated by the mesh size to polymer
length ratio. We support our analytical studies by extensive computer
simulations. These allow to verify assumptions essential to our theoretical
description and provide an excellent agreement with the analytically calculated
tube diameter. Furthermore, we present simulation data for the distribution
function of tube widths in the network.",2007-03-03T20:29:20Z
"Coherent electron dynamics in a two-dimensional random system with
  mobility edges","We study numerically the dynamics of a one-electron wave packet in a
two-dimensional random lattice with long-range correlated diagonal disorder in
the presence of a uniform electric field. The time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger
equation is used for this purpose. We find that the wave packet displays
Bloch-like oscillations associated with the appearance of a phase of
delocalized states in the strong correlation regime. The amplitude of
oscillations directly reflects the bandwidth of the phase and allows to measure
it. The oscillations reveal two main frequencies whose values are determined by
the structure of the underlying potential in the vicinity of the wave packet
maximum.",2007-01-10T13:50:33Z
Lenticular Galaxy Formation - Possible Luminosity Dependence,"We investigate the correlation between the bulge effective radius (r_e) and
disk scale length (r_d), in the near-infrared K band for lenticular galaxies in
the field and in clusters. We find markedly different relations between the two
parameters as a function of luminosity. Lenticulars with total absolute
magnitude fainter than M_T = -24.5 show a positive correlation, in line with
predictions of secular formation processes for the pseudo bulges of late-type
disk galaxies. But brighter lenticulars with M_T < -24.5 show an
anti-correlation, indicating that they formed through a different mechanism.
The available data are insufficient to reliably determine the effect of galaxy
environment on this correlation.",2007-03-26T17:55:47Z
The Resonant Light Absorption by Semiconductor Quantum Dots,"The cross section of light absorption by semiconductor quantum dots in the
case of the resonance with excitons $\Gamma_6 \times \Gamma_7$ in cubical
crystals $T_d$ is calculated. It is shown that an interference of stimulating
and induced electric and magnetic fields must be taken into account. The
absorption section is proportional to the exciton nonradiative damping
$\gamma$.",2007-03-13T04:53:13Z
The Electron-Glass in samples approaching the Mesoscopic regime,"We study the dependence of the glassy properties of strongly localized
indium-oxide films on the sample lateral dimensions. Characteristic mesoscopic
effects such as reproducible conductance fluctuations (CF) are readily
observable in gated structures for sample size smaller than 100 microns
measured at 4K, and the relative amplitude of the CF decreases with the sample
volume as does the flicker noise. By contrast, down to sample size of few
microns, the non-equilibrium features that are attributed to the electron-glass
are indistinguishable from those observed in macroscopic samples, and in
particular, the relaxation dynamics is independent of sample size down to 2
microns. In addition, The usual features that characterize the electron-glass
including slow-relaxation, memory effects, and full-aging behavior are all
observed in the `mesoscopic' regime, and they appear to be independent of the
conductance fluctuations.",2007-03-06T12:05:54Z
Absolute quantum energy inequalities in curved spacetime,"Quantum Energy Inequalities (QEIs) are results which limit the extent to
which the smeared renormalised energy density of the quantum field can be
negative, when averaged along a timelike curve or over a more general timelike
submanifold in spacetime. On globally hyperbolic spacetimes the
minimally-coupled massive quantum Klein--Gordon field is known to obey a
`difference' QEI that depends on a reference state chosen arbitrarily from the
class of Hadamard states. In many spacetimes of interest this bound cannot be
evaluated explicitly. In this paper we obtain the first `absolute' QEI for the
minimally-coupled massive quantum Klein--Gordon field on four dimensional
globally hyperbolic spacetimes; that is, a bound which depends only on the
local geometry. The argument is an adaptation of that used to prove the
difference QEI and utilises the Sobolev wave-front set to give a complete
characterisation of the singularities of the Hadamard series. Moreover, the
bound is explicit and can be formulated covariantly under additional (general)
conditions. We also generalise our results to incorporate adiabatic states.",2007-02-09T12:43:33Z
"Theory of fast optical spin rotation in a quantum dot based on geometric
  phases and trapped states","A method is proposed for the optical rotation of the spin of an electron in a
quantum dot using excited trion states to implement operations up to two orders
of magnitude faster than those of most existing proposals. Key ingredients are
the geometric phase induced by 2$\pi$ hyperbolic secant pulses, use of
coherently trapped states and use of naturally dark states. Our proposal covers
a wide variety of quantum dots by addressing different parameter regimes. In
one case the treatment provides an exact solution to the three-level system.
Numerical simulations with typical parameters for InAs self-assembled quantum
dots, including their dissipative dynamics, give fidelities of the operations
in excess of 99%.",2007-03-03T21:04:54Z
"Coherent Transport through an interacting double quantum dot: Beyond
  sequential tunneling","Various causes for negative differential conductance in transport through an
interacting double quantum dot are investigated. Particular focus is given to
the interplay between the renormalization of the energy levels due to the
coupling to the leads and the decoherence of the states. The calculations are
performed within a basis of many-particle eigenstates and we consider the
dynamics given by the von Neumann-equation taking into account also processes
beyond sequential tunneling. A systematic comparison between the levels of
approximation and also with different formalisms is performed. It is found that
the current is qualitatively well described by sequential processes as long as
the temperature is larger than the level broadening induced by the contacts.",2007-03-05T10:48:26Z
Basin Entropy in Boolean Network Ensembles,"The information processing capacity of a complex dynamical system is
reflected in the partitioning of its state space into disjoint basins of
attraction, with state trajectories in each basin flowing towards their
corresponding attractor. We introduce a novel network parameter, the basin
entropy, as a measure of the complexity of information that such a system is
capable of storing. By studying ensembles of random Boolean networks, we find
that the basin entropy scales with system size only in critical regimes,
suggesting that the informationally optimal partition of the state space is
achieved when the system is operating at the critical boundary between the
ordered and disordered phases.",2007-02-05T19:27:14Z
"Peculiarities in the properties of some rare-earth compounds with
  orthorhombic structures","Rare-earth manganites are fascinating, because they display a wide variety of
fundamental properties from magnetism to ferroelectricity, from colossal
magnetoresistance to semi-metallicity, and because they can be used in a number
of important technological applications such as controlling a magnetic memory
by an electric field or vice versa, new types of attenuators or transducers
etc. In this paper, we present our investigation on monocrystal samples with an
orthorhombic structure, grown in two different space groups: D2h(16) for
La0.78Pb0.22MnO3 and Pr0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and D2h(9) for HoMn2O5 and TbMn2O5. The
doped perovskite manganites Ln1-x Ax MnO3 (where Ln is a rare-earth ion and A
is a divalent ion) from the group D2h(16), which crystallized in different
modifications of the perovskite structure, characterized by the parameter
deformation of the type c/&#8730;2<b<a. Many properties of these compounds
(especially the giant magnetoresistance GMR, being interesting for practical
applications) depend strongly on the carrier density, on the specific zone
structure, on the type and the quantity of dopants, on the defects of the
crystal and their magnetic structure, or on the applied magnetic fields.",2007-01-29T12:17:09Z
"Level-occupation switching of the Quantum Dot, and phase anomalies in
  mesoscopic interferometry","For a variety of quantum dots, the widths of different single-particle levels
may naturally differ by orders of magnitude. In particular, the width of one
strongly coupled level may be larger than the spacing between other, very
narrow, levels. We found that in this case many consecutive Coulomb blockade
peaks are due to occupation of the same broad level. Between the peaks the
electron jumps from this level to one of the narrow levels and the transmission
through the dot at the next resonance essentially repeats that at the previous
one. This offers a natural explanation of the salient features of the behavior
of the transmission phase in an interferometer with a QD. The theory of this
effect will be reviewed with special emphasis on the role of the interactions.
New results on the dot-charging measurements and the fine structure of
occupation switchings will be presented, accompanied by the unified description
of the whole series of CB peaks caused by a single broad level. We then discuss
the case where the system approaches the Kondo regime.",2007-03-11T11:23:09Z
Multiparticle tunneling in diffusive superconducting junctions,"We formulate a theoretical framework to describe multiparticle current
transport in planar superconducting tunnel junctions with diffusive electrodes.
The approach is based on direct solving of quasiclassical Keldysh-Green
function equations for nonequilibrium superconductors, and consists of a
combination of a circuit theory analysis and improved perturbation expansion.
The theory predicts much greater scaling parameter for the subharmonic gap
structure of the tunnel current in diffusive junctions compared to the one in
ballistic junctions and mesoscopic constrictions with the same barrier
transparency.",2007-01-09T14:28:21Z
Heteronuclear molecules in an optical lattice: Theory and experiment,"We study properties of two different atoms at a single optical lattice site
at a heteronuclear atomic Feshbach resonance. We calculate the energy spectrum,
the efficiency of rf association and the lifetime as a function of magnetic
field and compare the results with the experimental data obtained for K-40 and
Rb-87 [C. Ospelkaus et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 120402 (2006)]. We treat the
interaction in terms of a regularized delta function pseudopotential and
consider the general case of particles with different trap frequencies, where
the usual approach of separating center-of-mass and relative motion fails. We
develop an exact diagonalization approach to the coupling between
center-of-mass and relative motion and numerically determine the spectrum of
the system. At the same time, our approach allows us to treat the anharmonicity
of the lattice potential exactly. Within the pseudopotential model, the center
of the Feshbach resonance can be precisely determined from the experimental
data.",2007-03-13T03:39:46Z
"The structure of the free energy surface of coarse-grained off-lattice
  protein models","We have performed multicanonical simulations of hydrophobic-hydrophilic
heteropolymers with a simple effective, coarse-grained off-lattice model to
study the structure and the topology of the energy surface. The multicanonical
method samples the whole rugged energy landscape, in particular the low-energy
part, and enables one to better understand the critical behaviors and visualize

Magnon condensation into Q-ball in 3He-B,"The theoretical prediction of Q-balls in relativistic quantum fields is
realized here experimentally in superfluid 3He-B. The condensed-matter analogs
of relativistic Q-balls are responsible for an extremely long lived signal of
magnetic induction -- the so-called Persistent Signal -- observed in NMR at the
lowest temperatures. This Q-ball is another representative of a state with
phase coherent precession of nuclear spins in 3He-B, similar to the well known
Homogeneously Precessing Domain which we interpret as Bose condensation of spin
waves -- magnons. At large Q the effect of self-localization is observed. In
the language of relativistic quantum fields it is caused by interaction between
the charged and neutral fields, where the neutral field provides the potential
for the charged one. In the process of self-localization the charged field
modifies locally the neutral field so that the potential well is formed in
which the charge is condensed.",2007-03-07T18:06:48Z
Effective Beam Width of Directional Antennas in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks,"It is known at a qualitative level that directional antennas can be used to
boost the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks. Lacking is a measure to
quantify this advantage and to compare directional antennas of different
footprint patterns. This paper introduces the concept of the effective beam
width (and the effective null width as its dual counterpart) as a measure which
quantitatively captures the capacity-boosting capability of directional
antennas. Beam width is commonly defined to be the directional angle spread
within which the main-lobe beam power is above a certain threshold. In
contrast, our effective beam width definition lumps the effects of the (i)
antenna pattern, (ii) active-node distribution, and (iii) channel
characteristics, on network capacity into a single quantitative measure. We
investigate the mathematical properties of the effective beam width and show
how the convenience afforded by these properties can be used to analyze the
effectiveness of complex directional antenna patterns in boosting network
capacity, with fading and multi-user interference taken into account. In
particular, we derive the extent to which network capacity can be scaled with
the use of phased array antennas. We show that a phased array antenna with N
elements can boost transport capacity of an Aloha-like network by a factor of
order N^1.620.",2007-01-21T09:32:01Z
"Scattering by Atomic Spins and Magnetoresistance in Dilute Magnetic
  Semiconductors","We studied electrical transport in magnetic semiconductors, which is
determined by scattering of free carriers off localized magnetic moments. We
calculated the scattering time and the mobility of the majority and
minority-spin carriers with both the effects of thermal spin fluctuations and
of spatial disorder of magnetic atoms taken into account. These are responsible
for the magnetic-field dependence of electrical resistivity. Namely, the
application of the external magnetic field suppresses the thermodynamic spin
fluctuations thus promoting negative magnetoresistance. Simultaneously,
scattering off the built-in spatial fluctuations of the atomic spin
concentrations may increase with the magnetic field. The latter effect is due
to the growth of the magnitude of random local Zeeman splittings with the
magnetic field. It promotes positive magnetoresistance. We discuss the role of
the above effects on magnetoresistance of non-degenerate semiconductors where
magnetic impurities are electrically active or neutral.",2007-02-20T19:44:17Z
Wave Propagation in the Cantor-Set Media: Chaos from Fractal,"Propagation of waves in the Cantor-set media is investigated by a
renormalization-group type method. We find fixed points for complete
reflection, $T^*=0$, and for complete transmission, $T^*=1$. In addition, the
wave numbers for which transmission coefficients show chaotic behaviors are
reported. The results obtained are for optical waves, and they can be tested in
optical experiments. Our method could be applied to any wave propagation
through the Cantor set.",2007-02-19T16:12:22Z
Cosmic String Structure at the Gravitational Radiation Scale,"We use our model of the small scale structure on cosmic strings to develop
further the result of Siemens, Olum, and Vilenkin that the gravitational
radiation length scale on cosmic strings is smaller than the previously assumed
$\Gamma G\mu t$. We discuss some of the properties of cosmic string loops at
this cutoff scale, and we argue that recent network simulations point to two
populations of cosmic string loops, one near the horizon scale and one near the
gravitational radiation cutoff.",2007-02-09T03:40:34Z
Fast Exact Method for Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem,"This paper describes TSP exact solution of polynomial complexity. It is

"Zero differential resistance state of two dimensional electron systems
  in strong magnetic fields","Zero differential resistance state is found in response to direct current
applied to 2D electron systems at strong magnetic field and low temperatures.
Transition to the state is accompanied by sharp dip of negative differential
resistance, which occurs above threshold value $I_{th}$ of the direct current.
The state depends significantly on the temperature and is not observable above
several Kelvins. Additional analysis shows lack of the linear stability of the
2D electron systems at $I>I_{th}$ and inhomogeneous, non-stationary pattern of
the electric current in the zero differential resistance state. We suggest that
the dc bias induced redistribution of the 2D electrons in energy space is the
dominant mechanism leading to the new electron state.",2007-03-04T00:37:40Z
Room Temperature Electrical Detection of Spin Coherence in C60,"An experimental demonstration of electrical detection of coherent spin motion
of weakly coupled, localized electron spins in thin Fullerene C60 films at room
temperature is presented. Pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance
experiments on vertical photocurrents through Al/C60/ZnO samples showed that an
electron spin Rabi oscillation is reflected by transient current changes. The
nature of possible microscopic mechanisms responsible for this spin to charge
conversion as well as its implications for the readout of endohedral Fullerene
(N@C60) spin qubits are discussed.",2007-02-26T16:24:40Z
"Joint Analysis of Cluster Observations: I. Mass Profile of Abell 478
  from Combined X-ray, Sunyaev-Z'eldovich, and Weak Lensing Data","We provide a new framework for the joint analysis of cluster observations
(JACO) using simultaneous fits to X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and weak
lensing data. Our method fits the mass models simultaneously to all data,
provides explicit separation of the gaseous, dark, and stellar components,
and--for the first time--allows joint constraints on all measurable physical
parameters. JACO includes additional improvements to previous X-ray techniques,
such as the treatment of the cluster termination shock and explicit inclusion
of the BCG's stellar mass profile. An application of JACO to the rich galaxy
cluster Abell 478 shows excellent agreement among the X-ray, lensing, and SZ
data. We find that Abell 478 is consistent with a cuspy dark matter profile
with inner slope n=1. Accounting for the stellar mass profile of the BCG allows
us to rule out inner dark matter slopes n>1.1 at the 99% confidence level. At
large radii, an 1/r^3 asymptotic slope is preferred over an 1/r^4 behavior. All
single power law dark matter models are ruled out at greater than the 99%
confidence level. JACO shows that self-consistent modeling of multiwavelength
data can provide powerful constraints on the shape of the dark profile.",2007-03-14T20:34:38Z
0.4 and 0.7 conductance anomalies in quantum point contacts,"Self-consistent modelling based on local spin-density formalism is employed
to calculate conductance of quantum point contacts at finite temperatures. The
total electrostatic potential exhibits spin-dependent splitting, which persists
at temperatures up to 0.5 K and gives rise to the anomalies at 0.4 and 0.7 of
the conductance quantum $2e^2/h$ occurring simultaneously in the absence of
external magnetic fields.",2007-03-13T04:01:44Z
Carbon in the pregalactic epoch and the search for the first haloes,"A possible way of detecting the first structure formation in a non-standard
BBN Universe during the dark age, due to the resonant scattering of the CMBR
photons in the rotational lines of the primordial CH molecule is discussed. The
calculations are made within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and
plausible first structure physical conditions. The carbon chemistry during the
pregalactic epoch is considered. The relative abundance of the CH molecule is
found to be $10^{-14}$ whereas the adopted [C]/[H] ratio was taken to be
$10^{-10}$. The optical depth, dT/T and integration times are estimated. The
calculated optical depth turns out to have values that are rather high, that
clearly argue in favor of this molecule as an excellent candidate in searches
of first structure formation. Possible observations with the GMT and ALMA are
discussed.",2007-03-21T06:23:18Z
Periodic boundary conditions on the pseudosphere,"We provide a framework to build periodic boundary conditions on the
pseudosphere (or hyperbolic plane), the infinite two-dimensional Riemannian
space of constant negative curvature. Starting from the common case of periodic
boundary conditions in the Euclidean plane, we introduce all the needed
mathematical notions and sketch a classification of periodic boundary
conditions on the hyperbolic plane. We stress the possible applications in
statistical mechanics for studying the bulk behavior of physical systems and we
illustrate how to implement such periodic boundary conditions in two examples,
the dynamics of particles on the pseudosphere and the study of classical spins
on hyperbolic lattices.",2007-03-13T16:12:49Z
Multidomain Spectral Method for the Helically Reduced Wave Equation,"We consider the 2+1 and 3+1 scalar wave equations reduced via a helical
Killing field, respectively referred to as the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional
helically reduced wave equation (HRWE). The HRWE serves as the fundamental
model for the mixed-type PDE arising in the periodic standing wave (PSW)
approximation to binary inspiral. We present a method for solving the equation
based on domain decomposition and spectral approximation. Beyond describing
such a numerical method for solving strictly linear HRWE, we also present
results for a nonlinear scalar model of binary inspiral. The PSW approximation
has already been theoretically and numerically studied in the context of the
post-Minkowskian gravitational field, with numerical simulations carried out
via the ""eigenspectral method."" Despite its name, the eigenspectral technique
does feature a finite-difference component, and is lower-order accurate. We
intend to apply the numerical method described here to the theoretically
well-developed post-Minkowski PSW formalism with the twin goals of spectral
accuracy and the coordinate flexibility afforded by global spectral
interpolation.",2007-02-08T17:29:59Z
"Browser-based distributed evolutionary computation: performance and
  scaling behavior","The challenge of ad-hoc computing is to find the way of taking advantage of
spare cycles in an efficient way that takes into account all capabilities of
the devices and interconnections available to them. In this paper we explore
distributed evolutionary computation based on the Ruby on Rails framework,
which overlays a Model-View-Controller on evolutionary computation. It allows
anybody with a web browser (that is, mostly everybody connected to the
Internet) to participate in an evolutionary computation experiment. Using a
straightforward farming model, we consider different factors, such as the size
of the population used. We are mostly interested in how they impact on
performance, but also the scaling behavior when a non-trivial number of
computers is applied to the problem. Experiments show the impact of different
packet sizes on performance, as well as a quite limited scaling behavior, due
to the characteristics of the server. Several solutions for that problem are
proposed.",2007-01-18T09:23:29Z
"Anomalous itinerant magnetism in single crystal Sr4Ru3O10: A
  thermodynamic and transport investigation","A thermodynamic and transport study of Sr4Ru3O10 as a function of temperature
and magnetic field is presented. The central results include a growing specific
heat C with increasing field B, a magnetic contribution to C/T at low
temperatures proportional to -log(T), an abrupt jump and a peak in C/T at 2.90
T and 7 T for B||ab-plane and B||c-axis, respectively, and corresponding
changes in the low T power laws of the resistivity. The novelty of this work
lies in the fact that this system is strongly anisotropic displaying
spontaneous ferromagnetism along the c-axis and an intralayer metamagnetic
transition with a possibility of a nearby quantum critical point. The exotic
behavior reflects new physics that is yet to be understood.",2007-03-14T20:18:54Z
Hierarchical Unambiguity,"We develop techniques to investigate relativized hierarchical unambiguous
computation. We apply our techniques to generalize known constructs involving
relativized unambiguity based complexity classes (UP and \mathcal{UP}) to new
constructs involving arbitrary higher levels of the relativized unambiguous
polynomial hierarchy (UPH). Our techniques are developed on constraints imposed
by hierarchical arrangement of unambiguous nondeterministic polynomial-time
Turing machines, and so they differ substantially, in applicability and in
nature, from standard methods (such as the switching lemma [Hastad,
Computational Limitations of Small-Depth Circuits, MIT Press, 1987]), which
play roles in carrying out similar generalizations.
  Aside from achieving these generalizations, we resolve a question posed by
Cai, Hemachandra, and Vyskoc [J. Cai, L. Hemachandra, and J. Vyskoc, Promises
and fault-tolerant database access, In K. Ambos-Spies, S. Homer, and U.
Schoening, editors, Complexity Theory, pages 101-146. Cambridge University

adaptive smart Turing access to \mathcal{UP}.",2007-02-08T16:00:25Z
"Intrinsic Heating and Cooling in Adiabatic Processes for Bosons in
  Optical Lattices","We show that by raising the lattice ""adiabatically"" as in all current optical
lattice experiments on bosons, even though the temperature may decrease
initially, it will eventually rise linearly with lattice height, taking the
system further away from quantum degeneracy. This increase is {\rm intrinsic}
and is caused by the {\em adiabatic compression} during the raising of red
detuned lattices. However, the origin of this heating, which is {\em entirely
different} from that in the bulk, also shows that one can {\em reverse} the
temperature rise to reach quantum degeneracy by {\em adiabatic expansion},
which can be achieved by using blue detuned lasers.",2007-03-07T06:43:36Z
Poisson-Bracket Approach to the Dynamics of Bent-Core Molecules,"We generalize our previous work on the phase stability and hydrodynamic of
polar liquid crystals possessing local uniaxial $C_{\infty v}$-symmetry to
biaxial systems exhibiting local $C_{2v}$-symmetry. Our work is motivated by
the recently discovered examples of thermotropic biaxial nematic liquid
crystals comprising bent-core mesogens, whose molecular structure is
characterized by a non-polar body axis $({\bf{n}})$ as well as a polar axis
$({\bf{p}})$ along the bisector of the bent mesogenic core which is coincident
with a large, transverse dipole moment. The free energy for this system differs
from that of biaxial nematic liquid crystals in that it contains terms
violating the ${\bf{p}}\to -{\bf{p}}$ symmetry. We show that, in spite of a
general splay instability associated with these parity-odd terms, a uniform
polarized biaxial state can be stable in a range of parameters. We then derive
the hydrodynamic equations of the system, via the Poisson-bracket formalism, in
the polarized state and comment on the structure of the corresponding linear
hydrodynamic modes. In our Poisson-bracket derivation, we also compute the
flow-alignment parameters along the three symmetry axes in terms of microscopic
parameters associated with the molecular geometry of the constituent biaxial
mesogens.",2007-02-27T21:24:38Z
The Ups and Downs of Cyclic Universes,"We investigate homogeneous and isotropic oscillating cosmologies with
multiple fluid components. Transfer of energy between these fluids is included
in order to model the effects of non-equilibrium behavior on closed universes.
We find exact solutions which display a range of new behaviors for the
expansion scale factor. Detailed examples are studied for the exchange of
energy from dust or scalar field into radiation. We show that, contrary to
expectation, it is unlikely that such models can offer a physically viable
solution to the flatness problem.",2007-01-12T23:14:54Z
Electronic and atomic shell structure in aluminum nanowires,"We report experiments on aluminum nanowires in ultra-high vacuum at room
temperature that reveal a periodic spectrum of exceptionally stable structures.
Two ""magic"" series of stable structures are observed: At low conductance, the
formation of stable nanowires is governed by electronic shell effects whereas
for larger contacts atomic packing dominates. The crossover between the two
regimes is found to be smooth. A detailed comparison of the experimental
results to a theoretical stability analysis indicates that while the main
features of the observed electron-shell structure are similar to those of
alkali and noble metals, a sequence of extremely stable wires plays a unique
role in Aluminum. This series appears isolated in conductance histograms and
can be attributed to ""superdeformed"" non-axisymmetric nanowires.",2007-03-22T18:32:22Z
"Frequency- and transverse wave-vector-dependent spin Hall conductivity
  in two-dimensional electron gas with disorder","We determine wave number $q$ and frequency $\omega$ dependent spin Hall
conductivity $\sigma_{yx}^s(q, \omega)$ for a disordered two dimensional
electron system with Rashba spin orbit interaction when $\q$ is {\it
transverse} to the electric field. Both the conventional definition of spin
current and its new definition which takes care of the conservation of spins,
have been considered. The spin Hall conductivitivities for both of these
definitions are qualitatively similar. $\sigma_{yx}^s(q, \omega)$ is zero at
$q=0, \omega =0$ and is maximum at $q=0$ and at small but finite $\omega$ whose
value depends on different parameters of the system. Interestingly for $\omega
\to 0$, $\sigma_{yx}^s(q)$ resonates when $\Lambda \simeq L_{so}$ which are the
wavelength $(\Lambda = 2\pi/q)$ of the electric field's spatial variation and
the length for one cycle of spin precession respectively. The sign of the
out-of-plane component of the electrons' spin flips when the sign of electric
field changes due to its spatial variation along transverse direction. It
changes the mode of spin precession from clockwise to anti-clockwise or {\it
vice versa} and consequently a finite spin Hall current flows in the bulk of
the system.",2007-02-21T10:39:08Z
Generalized Gibbs canonical ensemble: A possible physical scenario,"After reviewing some fundamental results derived from the introduction of the
generalized Gibbs canonical ensemble, such as the called thermodynamic
uncertainty relation, it is described a physical scenario where such a
generalized ensemble naturally appears as a consequence of a modification of
the energetic interchange mechanism between the interest system and its
surrounding, which could be relevant within the framework of long-range
interacting systems.",2007-01-17T21:33:40Z
"Detailed comparison of LIGO and Virgo Inspiral Pipelines in Preparation
  for a Joint Search","Presented in this paper is a detailed and direct comparison of the LIGO and
Virgo binary neutron star detection pipelines. In order to test the search
programs, numerous inspiral signals were added to 24 hours of simulated
detector data. The efficiencies of the different pipelines were tested, and
found to be comparable. Parameter estimation routines were also tested. We
demonstrate that there are definite benefits to be had if LIGO and Virgo
conduct a joint coincident analysis; these advantages include increased
detection efficiency and the providing of source sky location information.",2007-01-03T16:26:22Z
"Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of band tails in lightly doped
  cuprates","We amend ab initio strongly-correlated band structures by taking into account
the band-tailing phenomenon in doped charge-transfer Mott-Hubbard insulators.
We show that the photoemission from band tails accounts for sharp
""quasi-particle"" peaks, rapid loss of their intensities in some directions of
the Brillouin zone (""Fermi-arcs"") and high-energy ""waterfall"" anomalies as a
consequence of matrix-element effects of disorder-localised states in the
charge-transfer gap of doped cuprates.",2007-02-26T17:08:40Z
"Neutron Scattering Study on the Field-Induced $O_{xy}$-type
  Antiferroquadrupolar Ordering of Heavy-Fermion Superconductor $PrOs_4Sb_{12}$","Neutron scattering experiments have revealed a field-induced
antiferroquadrupolar order parameter in the Pr-based heavy-fermion
superconductor PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$. We observed the field-induced
antiferromagnetic dipole moment with the propagation vector
{\textit{\textbf{q}}} = (1 0 0) for the applied field direction both
{\textit{\textbf{H}}}${\parallel}$[1 1 0] and [0 0 1]. For
{\textit{\textbf{H}}}${\parallel}$[1 1 0] at 8 T, it should be noted that the
induced antiferromagnetic moment of 0.16(10) ${\mu}_{\rm B}$/Pr orients
parallel to the field within our experimental accuracy. This observation is
strong evidence that the $O_{xy}$ electric quadrupole to be the primary order
parameter for {\textit{\textbf{H}}}${\parallel}$[1 1 0]. A mean-field
calculation, based on ${\Gamma}_1$ singlet and ${\Gamma}_4^{(2)}$ excited
triplet with the $O_{xy}$ quadrupolar interaction, reproduces the induced
moment direction and its field response. These facts indicate the predominance
of $O_{xy}$-type antiferroquadrupolar interaction in PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$.",2007-01-25T02:00:53Z
Transport of fractional Hall quasiparticles through an antidot,"Current statistics of an antidot in the fractional quantum Hall regime is
studied for Laughlin's series. The chiral Luttinger liquid picture of edge
states with a renormalized interaction exponent $g$ is adopted. Several
peculiar features are found in the sequential tunneling regime. On one side,
current displays negative differential conductance and double-peak structures
when $g<1$. On the other side, universal sub-poissonian transport regimes are
identified through an analysis of higher current moments. A comparison between
Fano factor and skewness is proposed in order to clearly distinguish the charge
of the carriers, regardless of possible non-universal interaction
renormalizations. Super-poissonian statistics is obtained in the shot limit for
$g<1$, and plasmonic effects due to the finite-size antidot are tracked.",2007-01-18T09:35:11Z
Representability problems for coarse-grained water potentials,"The use of an effective intermolecular potential often involves a compromise
between more accurate, complex functional forms and more tractable simple
representations. To study this choice in detail, we systematically derive
coarse-grained isotropic pair potentials that accurately reproduce the
oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function of the TIP4P-Ew water model at state
points over density ranges from 0.88-1.30g/cc and temperature ranges from
235K-310K. Although by construction these effective potentials correctly
represent the isothermal compressibility of TIP4P-Ew water, they do not
accurately resolve other thermodynamic properties such as the virial pressure,
the internal energy or thermodynamic anomalies. Because at a given state point
the pair potential that reproduces the pair structure is unique, we have
therefore explicitly demonstrated that it is impossible to simultaneously
represent the pair-structure and several key equilibrium thermodynamic
properties of water with state-point dependent radially symmetric pair
potentials. We argue that such representability problems are related to, but
different from, more widely acknowledged transferability problems, and discuss
in detail the implications this has for the modeling of water and other liquids
by coarse-grained potentials. Nevertheless, regardless of thermodynamic
inconsistencies, the state-point dependent effective potentials for water do
generate structural and dynamical anomalies.",2007-02-22T22:00:08Z
Rod-like Polyelectrolyte Brushes with Mono- and Multivalent Counterions,"A model of rod-like polyelectrolyte brushes in the presence of monovalent and
multivalent counterions but with no added-salt is studied using Monte Carlo
simulation. The average height of the brush, the histogram of rod
conformations, and the counterion density profile are obtained for different
values of the grafting density of the charge-neutral wall. For a domain of
grafting densities, the brush height is found to be relatively insensitive to
the density due to a competition between counterion condensation and inter-rod
repulsion. In this regime, multivalent counterions collapse the brush in the
form of linked clusters. Nematic order emerges at high grafting densities,
resulting is an abrupt increase of the brush height.",2007-01-10T12:56:30Z
"The influence of a single quantum dot state on the characteristics of a
  microdisk laser","We report a quantum dot microcavity laser with a cw sub-microwatt lasing
threshold, where a significant reduction of the lasing threshold is observed
when a single quantum dot (QD) state is aligned with a cavity mode. The quality
factor exceeds 15 000 before the system lases. When no QD states are resonant,
below threshold the cavity mode initially degrades with increasing pump power,
after which saturation occurs and then the cavity mode recovers. We associate
the initial cavity mode spoiling with QD state broadening that occurs with
increasing pump power.",2007-02-23T21:41:10Z
"Non-Perturbative Treatment of Charge and Spin Fluctuations in the
  Two-Dimensional Extended Hubbard Model: Extended Two-Particle Self-Consistent
  Approach","We study the spin and charge fluctuations of the extended Hubbard model (EHM)
with on-site interaction U and first neighbor interaction V on the
two-dimensional square lattice in the weak to intermediate coupling regime. We
propose an extension of the two-particle self-consistent (ETPSC) approximation
that includes the effect of functional derivatives of the pair correlation
functions on irreducible spin and charge vertices. These functional derivatives
were ignored in our previous work. We evaluate them assuming particle-hole
symmetry. The resulting theory satisfies conservations laws and the
Mermin-Wagner theorem. Our current results are in much better agreement with
benchmark Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) results. As a function of U and V, we can
determine the crossover temperatures towards renormalized classical regimes
where either spin or charge fluctuations dominate. The dominant wave vector is
self-determined by the approach.",2007-03-11T03:46:03Z
Minor Galaxy Interactions: Star Formation Rates and Galaxy Properties,"We study star formation in a sample of 1204 galaxies in minor (| \Delta m_z |
\geq 2) pairs and compact groups, drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release 5 (SDSS DR5). We analyze an analogous sample of 2409 galaxies in major
(| \Delta m_z | < 2$) pairs and compact groups to ensure that our selection
reproduces previous results, and we use a ``field'' sample of 65,570 galaxies
for comparison. Our major and minor pairs samples include only galaxies in
spectroscopically confirmed pairs, where the recessional velocity separation
$\Delta V < 500$ km/s and the projected spatial separation $\Delta D < 50$
kpc/h. The relative magnitude (a proxy for the mass ratio) of the pair is an
important parameter in the effectiveness of the tidally triggered star
formation in minor interactions. As expected, the secondary galaxies in minor
pairs show evidence for tidally triggered star formation, whereas the primary
galaxies in the minor pairs do not. The galaxy color is also an important
parameter in the effectiveness of triggered star formation in the major galaxy
pairs. In the major pairs sample, there is a correlation between the specific
H$\alpha$ star formation rate (SSFR) and $\Delta D$ in the blue primary and
blue secondary galaxies; for the red primary and red secondary galaxies, there
is none. Galaxies in pairs have a higher mean SSFR at every absolute magnitude
compared to matched sets of field galaxies, and the relative increase in mean
SSFR becomes larger with decreasing intrinsic luminosity. We also detect a
significantly increased AGN fraction in the pair galaxies compared to matched
sets of field galaxies.",2007-03-28T15:48:25Z
Coding Solutions for the Secure Biometric Storage Problem,"The paper studies the problem of securely storing biometric passwords, such
as fingerprints and irises. With the help of coding theory Juels and Wattenberg
derived in 1999 a scheme where similar input strings will be accepted as the
same biometric. In the same time nothing could be learned from the stored data.
They called their scheme a ""fuzzy commitment scheme"". In this paper we will
revisit the solution of Juels and Wattenberg and we will provide answers to two
important questions: What type of error-correcting codes should be used and
what happens if biometric templates are not uniformly distributed, i.e. the
biometric data come with redundancy. Answering the first question will lead us
to the search for low-rate large-minimum distance error-correcting codes which
come with efficient decoding algorithms up to the designed distance. In order
to answer the second question we relate the rate required with a quantity
connected to the ""entropy"" of the string, trying to estimate a sort of
""capacity"", if we want to see a flavor of the converse of Shannon's noisy
coding theorem. Finally we deal with side-problems arising in a practical
implementation and we propose a possible solution to the main one that seems to
have so far prevented real life applications of the fuzzy scheme, as far as we
know.",2007-01-16T23:22:41Z
Limits of the upper critical field in dirty two-gap superconductors,"An overview of the theory of the upper critical field in dirty two-gap
superconductors, with a particular emphasis on MgB$_2$ is given. We focus here
on the maximum $H_{c2}$ which may be achieved by increasing intraband
scattering, and on the limitations imposed by weak interband scattering and
paramagnetic effects. In particular, we discuss recent experiments which have
recently demonstrated ten-fold increase of $H_{c2}$ in dirty carbon-doped films
as compared to single crystals, so that the $H_{c2}(0)$ parallel to the ab
planes may approach the BCS paramagnetic limit, $H_p[T] = 1.84T_c[K] \simeq
60-70T$. New effects produced by weak interband scattering in the two-gap
Ginzburg-Landau equations and $H_{c2}(T)$ in ultrathin MgB$_2$ films are
addressed.",2007-01-12T15:42:18Z
Multicomponent Bright Solitons in F = 2 Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates,"We study soliton solutions for the Gross--Pitaevskii equation of the spinor
Bose--Einstein condensates with hyperfine spin F=2 in one-dimension. Analyses
are made in two ways: by assuming single-mode amplitudes and by generalizing
Hirota's direct method for multi-components. We obtain one-solitons of
single-peak type in the ferromagnetic, polar and cyclic states, respectively.
Moreover, twin-peak type solitons both in the ferromagnetic and the polar state
are found.",2007-03-30T09:38:44Z
Dark Matter: The Case of Sterile Neutrino,"An extension of the Standard Model by three right-handed neutrinos with
masses smaller than the electroweak scale (the $\nu$MSM) can explain
simultaneously dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe, being
consistent with the data on neutrino oscillations. A dark matter candidate in
this theory is the sterile neutrino with the mass in keV range. We discuss the
constraints on the properties of this particle and mechanisms of their
cosmological production. Baryon asymmetry generation in this model is reviewed.
Crucial experiments that can confirm or rule out the $\nu$MSM are briefly
discussed.",2007-03-27T08:10:32Z
Local density of states at zigzag edge of carbon nanotubes and graphene,"The electron-phonon matrix element for edge states of carbon nanotubes and
graphene at zigzag edges is calculated for obtaining renormalized energy
dispersion of the edge states. Self-energy correction by electron-phonon
interaction contributes to the energy dispersion of edge states whose energy
bandwidth is similar to phonon energy. Since the energy-uncertainty of the edge
state is larger than temperature, we conclude that the single-particle picture
of the edge state in not appropriate when the electron-phonon interaction is
taken into account. The longitudinal acoustic phonon mode contributes to the
matrix element through the on-site deformation potential because the
wavefunction of the edge state has an amplitude only on one of the two
sublattices. The on-site deformation potentials for the longitudinal and

results of local density of states are compared with the recent experimental

"Critical temperature and specific heat for Cooper pairing on a spherical
  surface","Based on an exact solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type Hamiltonian
on a spherical surface, we calculate the specific heat for the electron system
with pair correlations on a sphere. We find that it is possible to extract from
the specific heat a temperature above which many-body states with broken Cooper
pairs get populated. Therefore, we define this temperature as the
characteristic temperature signalling the onset of a BCS-type pair-correlated
state for electrons on a spherical surface. Such spherical electron systems are
realized in multielectron bubbles in liquid helium, for which the
above-mentioned characteristic temperature is found to be of the order of
10-100 mK. Both the specific heat and the critical temperature show a
pronounced (4-6%) odd-even parity effect that persists even for numbers of
electrons as large as 10$^6$.",2007-01-23T19:38:20Z
Magnetic vortex oscillator driven by dc spin-polarized current,"Transfer of angular momentum from a spin-polarized current to a ferromagnet
provides an efficient means to control the dynamics of nanomagnets. A peculiar
consequence of this spin-torque, the ability to induce persistent oscillations
of a nanomagnet by applying a dc current, has previously been reported only for
spatially uniform nanomagnets. Here we demonstrate that a quintessentially
nonuniform magnetic structure, a magnetic vortex, isolated within a nanoscale
spin valve structure, can be excited into persistent microwave-frequency
oscillations by a spin-polarized dc current. Comparison to micromagnetic
simulations leads to identification of the oscillations with a precession of
the vortex core. The oscillations, which can be obtained in essentially zero
magnetic field, exhibit linewidths that can be narrower than 300 kHz, making
these highly compact spin-torque vortex oscillator devices potential candidates
for microwave signal-processing applications, and a powerful new tool for
fundamental studies of vortex dynamics in magnetic nanostructures.",2007-02-09T23:20:56Z
"Bimodal Infrared Colors of the M87 Globular Cluster System: Peaks in the
  Metallicity Distribution","The globular cluster (GC) systems of many galaxies reveal bimodal optical
color distributions. Based on stellar evolutionary models and the bimodal
colors and metallicities of Galactic GCs this is thought to reflect an
underlying bimodal metallicity distribution. However, stars at many different
phases of stellar evolution contribute to optical light. The I-H color is a
much cleaner tracer of metallicity because it primarily samples the metallicity
sensitive giant branch. Therefore, we use deep HST-NICMOS H, and WFPC2 optical
observations, of M87 GCs to study their metallicity distribution. The M87
clusters are bimodal in I-H, for which there is no known physical explanation
other than a bimodal metallicity distribution. Moreover, the two modes defined
by the B-I and I-H colors are comprised of roughly the same two sets of
objects, confirming that optical colors also primarily trace the metallicity.
This is inconsistent with a recent suggestion based on one model of metallicity
effects on the horizontal branch that bimodality arises from an underlying
unimodal metallicity distribution due to a specific color-metallicity relation.
We also find no discernable variation in the peak colors of the M87 GCs out to
roughly 75 kpc due to the declining ratio of red-to-blue GCs, as implied by
this model. Similarly, there is no evidence that the bimodal peaks are bluer
for systems with large blue-to-red GC ratio. Our observations confirm that the
primary cause of bimodality in cluster systems is an underlying bimodal
metallicity distribution, and not the specific color-metallicity relationship
defined by this horizontal branch model.",2007-03-15T19:10:54Z
"Charge and magnetic order in the 2D Falicov-Kimball model with Hund
  coupling at finite temperatures","We perform a simplified analysis of finite temperature properties of the
generalized Falicov-Kimball model with Hund coupling. The model is studied on
the square lattice for fixed values of \emph{f-electron} and \emph{d-electron}
densities $\rho_f=1/2$, $\rho_d=1$. Using an approxiamte scheme we estimated
free energies of the following three phases: the charge and spin ordered (SCO),
the charge ordered (CO) and the non-ordered (NO). Comparing the free energies
we detected phase transitions and found how the transition temperatures depend
on the on-site interaction parameters. It appears, that the transition
temperture between SCO and CO is much lower than between CO and NO, but their
maximum values are attained at values of coupling constants very close to each
other.",2007-02-17T20:46:11Z
"Statistics of Particle Trajectories at Short Time Intervals Reveal
  fN-Scale Colloidal Forces","We describe and implement a technique for extracting forces from the
relaxation of an overdamped thermal system with normal modes. At sufficiently
short time intervals, the evolution of a normal mode is well described by a
one-dimensional Smoluchowski equation with constant drift velocity, v, and
diffusion coefficient, D. By virtue of fluctuation-dissipation, these transport
coefficients are simply related to conservative forces, F, acting on the normal
mode: F = k_BT v/D. This relationship implicitly accounts for hydrodynamic
interactions, requires no mechanical calibration, makes no assumptions about
the form of conservative forces, and requires no prior knowledge of material
properties. We apply this method to measure the electrostatic interactions of
polymer microspheres suspended in nonpolar microemulsions.",2007-02-20T18:53:50Z
"Enhanced current flow through meandering and tilted grain boundaries in
  YBCO films","Grain boundaries (GBs) have been shown to limit critical current density, Jc,
in YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) coated conductors. Here we use transport measurements and
scanning Hall probe microscopy coupled with current reconstruction to
demonstrate that GB geometry, such as the in-plane meandering observed in films
grown by metalorganic deposition (MOD) on rolling assisted biaxially textured
substrate (RABiTS), can lead to higher GB Jc. We observe current-induced flux
entry into such a coated conductor, then model its behavior by imaging films
with single, straight GBs tilted at various angles to the applied current.",2007-01-03T09:25:02Z
"Lateral diffusion of receptor-ligand bonds in membrane adhesion zones:
  Effect of thermal membrane roughness","The adhesion of cells is mediated by membrane receptors that bind to
complementary ligands in apposing cell membranes. It is generally assumed that
the lateral diffusion of mobile receptor-ligand bonds in membrane-membrane
adhesion zones is slower than the diffusion of unbound receptors and ligands.
We find that this slowing down is not only caused by the larger size of the
bound receptor-ligand complexes, but also by thermal fluctuations of the
membrane shape. We model two adhering membranes as elastic sheets pinned
together by receptor-ligand bonds and study the diffusion of the bonds using
Monte Carlo simulations. In our model, the fluctuations reduce the bond
diffusion constant in planar membranes by a factor close to 2 in the
biologically relevant regime of small bond concentrations.",2007-03-19T17:24:34Z
Impurity Conduction and Magnetic Polarons in Antiferromagnetic Oxides,"Low-temperature transport and magnetization measurements for the
antiferromagnets SrMnO(3) and CaMnO(3) identify an impurity band of mobile
states separated by energy E from electrons bound in Coulombic potentials. Very
weak electric fields are sufficient to excite bound electrons to the impurity
band, increasing the mobile carrier concentration by more than three orders of
magnitude. The data argue against the formation of self-trapped magnetic
polarons (MPs) predicted by theory, and rather imply that bound MPs become
stable only for kT<<E.",2007-02-26T16:51:22Z
"Conductance and thermoelectric power in carbon nanotubes with magnetic
  impurities","By introducing a normal self-energy to incorporate the effects of magnetic
impurities, Kondo effects in single-walled metallic carbon nanotubes are
investigated within the Anderson model and Landauer formula. Magnetic
impurities induce Kondo resonance and bring a valley of conductance unction
near the Fermi level. The conductance of the nanotube increases with the
temperature in the low temperature range. Thermoelectric power induced by
magnetic impurities is gotten from Mott relation, and the calculations indicate
its dependence on the temperature could interpret the experiment well.",2007-03-14T14:19:08Z
"Irreversibility line and low-field grain-boundary pinning in
  electron-doped superconducting thin films","AC magnetic susceptibilities of electron-doped Pr_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_4 (PCCO)
and Sm_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_4 (SCCO) granular thin films have been measured as a
function of temperature and magnetic-field strength. Depending on the level of
homogeneity of our films, two different types of the irreversibility line (IL)
defined as the intergrain-loss peak temperature in the imaginary part of
susceptibility have been found. The obtained results are described via the
critical-state model taking into account the low-field grain-boundary pinning.
The extracted pinning-force densities in more granular SCCO films turn out to
be four times larger than their counterparts in less granular PCCO films.",2007-01-19T10:30:07Z
Stationary State Fluctuation Theorems for Driven Langevin Systems,"Recent results on the stationary state Fluctuation Theorems for work and heat
fluctuations of Langevin systems are presented. The relevance of finite time
corrections in understanding experimental and simulation results is explained
in the context of an exactly solvable model, namely a Brownian particle in a
harmonic potential, which is dragged through the surrounding fluid. In this
model, work fluctuations obey the conventional form of the fluctuation theorem
while heat fluctuations satisfy an extended form. The connection with other
work in recent literature is pointed out, and further generalizations are
suggested.",2007-01-27T16:38:28Z

in crystals with a molar volume of 21.3 cm^3. It is temperature independent
from 1 K to 140 mK, with no evidence for an anomaly in the vicinity of the
proposed supersolid transition. The mean square displacement is different for
in-plane motions (0.122 +/- 0.001 A^(2)) and out-of-plane motions (0.150 +/-
0.001 A ^(2)).",2007-02-23T20:15:24Z
Coherence properties of spinor condensates at finite temperatures,"We consider a spinor condensate of 87Rb atoms in its F=1 hyperfine state at
finite temperatures. Putting initially all atoms in m_F=0 component we find
that the system evolves into the state of thermal equilibrium. This state is
approached in a step-like process and when established it manifests itself in
distinguishable ways. The atoms in states m_F=+1 and m_F=-1 start to rotate in
opposite directions breaking the chiral symmetry and showing highly regular
spin textures. Also the coherence properties of the system changes
dramatically. Depending on the strength of spin-changing collisions the system
first enters the stage where the m_F=+1 and m_F=-1 spinor condensate components
periodically loose and recover their mutual coherence whereas their thermal
counterparts get completely dephased. For stronger spin changing collisions the
system enters the regime where also the strong coherence between other
components is built up.",2007-02-02T19:05:52Z
Formation of Wigner crystals in conducting polymer nanowires,"The search for theoretically predicted Wigner crystal in one-dimensional (1D)
wires of structurally disordered materials exhibiting properties of
charge-density-waves have remained unsuccessful. Based on the results of a low
temperature conductivity study we report here formation of such 1D Wigner
crystal (1DWC) in polypyrrole nanowires having low electron densities. The
current-voltage characteristics of all the nanowires show a 'gap' that
decreases rapidly as the temperature is increased - confirming the existence of
long-range electron-electron interaction in the nanowires. The measured current
show power-law dependence on voltage and temperature as expected in 1DWC. A
switching transition to highly conducting state has been observed above a
threshold voltage, which can be tuned by changing the diameters of the
nanowires and the temperature. Negative differential resistance and enhancement
of noise has been observed above the threshold as expected.",2007-02-01T07:02:21Z
Critical Point of an Interacting Two-Dimensional Atomic Bose Gas,"We have measured the critical atom number in an array of harmonically trapped
two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases of rubidium atoms at different temperatures. We
found this number to be about five times higher than predicted by the
semi-classical theory of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the ideal gas.
This demonstrates that the conventional BEC picture is inapplicable in an
interacting 2D atomic gas, in sharp contrast to the three-dimensional case. A
simple heuristic model based on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory of
2D superfluidity and the local density approximation accounts well for our
experimental results.",2007-03-08T08:53:53Z
"Boundary quantum criticality in models of magnetic impurities coupled to
  bosonic baths","We investigate quantum impurity problems, where a local magnetic moment is
coupled to the spin density of a bosonic environment, leading to bosonic
versions of the standard Kondo and Anderson impurity models. In a physical
situation, these bosonic environments can correspond either to deconfined
spinons in certain classes of Z_2 frustrated antiferromagnets, or to particles
in a multicomponent Bose gase (in which case the spin degree of freedom is
attributed to hyperfine levels). Using renormalization group techniques, we
establish that our impurity models, which feature an exchange interaction
analogous to Kondo impurities in Fermi liquids, allow the flow towards a stable
strong-coupling state. Since the low-energy bosons live around a single point
in momentum space, and there is no Fermi surface, an impurity quantum phase
transition occurs at intermediate coupling, separating screened and unscreened
phases. This behavior is qualitatively different from previously studied
spin-isotropic variants of the spin-boson model, which display stable
intermediate-coupling fixed points and no screening.",2007-03-23T12:19:42Z
Classical Dark Matter,"Classical particle-like solutions of field equations such as general
relativity, could account for dark matter. Such particles would not interact

gravitation. As a relic from the big bang, they would be a candidate for cold
dark matter consistent with observations.",2007-01-17T17:26:36Z
"Influence of charge order on the magnetic properties of
  Na$_{x}$CoO$_{2}$ for $x>0.65$","We have synthesized and characterized the four different stable phases of Na
ordered Na$_{x}$CoO$_{2}$, for $0.65<x\lesssim 0.75$. Above 100K they display
similar Curie-Weiss spin susceptibilities as well as ferromagnetic $q=0$ spin
fluctuations in the CoO$_{2}$ planes revealed respectively by $^{23}$Na NMR
shift and spin lattice $T_{1}$ data. The Co disproportionate already above 300K
into Co$^{3+}$ and $\approx $Co$^{3.5+}$ in all phases, which allows us to
understand that magnetism is favoured. Below 100K the paramagnetic properties
become quite distinct, and a 3D magnetic order sets in only for $x=0.75$, so
that charge order has a subtle incidence on the low $T$ energy scales and
transverse magnetic couplings.",2007-03-21T20:31:15Z
"The Meso-Structured Magnetic Atmosphere -- A Stochastic Polarized
  Radiative Transfer Approach","We present a general radiative transfer model which allows the Zeeman
diagnostics of complex and unresolved solar magnetic fields. Present modeling
techniques still rely to a large extent on a-priori assumptions about the
geometry of the underlying magnetic field. In an effort to obtain a more
flexible and unbiased approach we pursue a rigorous statistical description of
the underlying atmosphere. Based on a Markov random field model the atmospheric
structures are characterized in terms of probability densities and spatial
correlations. This approach allows us to derive a stochastic transport equation
for polarized light valid in a regime with an arbitrary fluctuating magnetic
field on finite scales. One of the key ingredients of the derived stochastic
transfer equation is the correlation length which provides an additional degree
of freedom to the transport equation and can be used as a diagnostic parameter
to estimate the characteristic length scale of the underlying magnetic field.
  It is shown that the stochastic transfer equation represents a natural
extension of the (polarized) line formation under the micro- and macroturbulent
assumption and contains both approaches as limiting cases. In particular, we
show how in an inhomogeneous atmosphere asymmetric Stokes profiles develop and
that the correlation length directly controls the degree of asymmetry and net
circular polarization (NCP). In a number of simple numerical model calculations
we demonstrate the importance of a finite correlation length for the polarized
line formation and its impact on the resulting Stokes line profiles.",2007-03-13T18:48:21Z
"The Effect of Nanoparticle Shape on Polymer-Nanocomposite Rheology and
  Tensile Strength","Nanoparticles can influence the properties of polymer materials by a variety
of mechanisms. With fullerene, carbon nanotube, and clay or graphene sheet
nanocomposites in mind, we investigate how particle shape influences the melt
shear viscosity $\eta$ and the tensile strength $\tau$, which we determine via
molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations of compact (icosahedral), tube
or rod-like, and sheet-like model nanoparticles indicate an order of magnitude
increase in the viscosity $\eta$ relative to the pure melt. This finding
evidently can not be explained by continuum hydrodynamics and we provide
evidence that the $\eta$ increase in our model nanocomposites has its origin in
chain bridging between the nanoparticles. We find that this increase is the
largest for the rod-like nanoparticles and least for the sheet-like
nanoparticles. Curiously, the enhancements of $\eta$ and $\tau$ exhibit {\it
opposite trends} with increasing chain length $N$ and with particle shape
anisotropy. Evidently, the concept of bridging chains alone cannot account for
the increase in $\tau$ and we suggest that the deformability or flexibility of
the sheet nanoparticles contributes to nanocomposite strength and toughness by
reducing the relative value of the Poisson ratio of the composite. Our
simulations point to a substantial contribution of nanoparticle shape to both
mechanical and processing properties of polymer nanocomposites.",2007-01-24T23:35:03Z
Scattering approach to impurity thermodynamics,"Recently the authors developed a scattering approach that allows for a
complete description of the steady-state physics of quantum-impurities in and
out of equilibrium. Quantum impurities are described using scattering
eigenstates defined ab initio on the open, infinite line with asymptotic
boundary conditions imposed by the leads. The scattering states on the open
line are constructed for integrable quantum-impurity models by means of a
significant generalization of the Bethe-Ansatz which we call the Scattering
Bethe-Ansatz (SBA). The purpose of the paper is to present in detail the
scattering approach to quantum-impurity models and the SBA and show that they
reproduce well-known thermodynamic results for several widely studied models:
the Resonance Level model, Interacting Resonance Level model and the Kondo
model. Though the SBA is more complex than the traditional Thermodynamic Bethe
Ansatz (TBA) when applied to thermodynamical questions, the scattering approach
(SBA) allows access to an array of new questions that cannot be addressed
otherwise, ranging from scattering of electrons off magnetic impurities to
nonequilibrium dynamics.",2007-02-26T20:22:49Z
Multi-object Spectroscopy of Young Star Clusters in NGC 4676,"Galaxy interactions are known to trigger starbursts. The young star clusters
formed in mergers may be young globular clusters. The ages of these young star
clusters yield the timing of interaction-triggered star formation and provide
an important way to reconstruct the history of merging galaxies. Here we
present the first results from our investigation into age and metallicity of
twelve young clusters in the merging galaxy pair NGC 4676, using spectra from
the multi-object Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on Keck. For ten
clusters, comparison of the Balmer emission lines with model equivalent widths
(EWs) yields ages less than 10 Myr. Two spectra display Balmer absorption lines
typical of star clusters dominated by A-type stars, with estimated ages of
about 170 Myr. These ages are comparable to the dynamical age of the tidal
tails and are consistent with star formation triggered during the first passage
of the pair. The locations of these two clusters in the tidal tails are
generally consistent with predictions of shock-induced star formation models.
One of these older objects appears unresolved on the image and is luminous
enough to qualify as a young globular cluster. Using EWs of the diagnostic
lines [OII] and [OIII], we obtain oxygen abundances in the range 7.3 <
12+log(O/H) < 9.0. These values show a nearly flat distribution along the
northern tail, suggesting efficient gas mixing in the tail.",2007-03-19T22:18:09Z
"Correlations in 2D electron gas at arbitrary temperature and spin
  polarizations","Using the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sjolander theory we have studied the many-body
effects in the two-dimensional electron gas with arbitrary polarization at
finite temperatures. We have calculated the structure factors, pair correlation

values of spin polarization, temperature and density parameter. We have shown
that the spin polarization and finite temperature effects are remarkable and in
the low temperature or paramagnetic case our results match closely with those

Interference of Degenerate Polariton Condensates in Microcavities,"We demonstrate theoretically that the interaction of two degenerate

is governed by the polarization of the condensates and can be fully suppressed
for certain polarizations. A polarization controlled solid state optical gate
is proposed.",2007-03-26T12:54:47Z
The SMC Super-Shells as Probes of the Turbulent Dynamics of the ISM,"The spatial power spectrum of the HI 21 cm intensity in the Small Magellanic
Cloud (Stanimirovic et al 1999) is a power law over scales as large as those of
the SMC itself. It was interpreted as due to turbulence by Goldman (2000) and
by Stanimirovic & Lazarian (2001). The question is whether the power spectrum
is indeed the result of a dynamical turbulence or is merely the result of a
structured static density. In the turbulence interpretation of Goldman (2000)
the turbulence was generated by the tidal effects of the last close passage of
the LMC about 0.2 Gyr ago. The turbulence time-scale was estimated by Goldman
to be 0.4 Gyr, so the turbulence has not decayed yet. Staveley-Smith et al
(1997) observed in the SMC about five hundreds of HI super shells. Their age is
more than an order of magnitude smaller than the turbulence age. Therefore, if
the turbulence explanation holds, their observed radial velocities should
reflect the turbulence in the gas in which they formed. In the present work we
analyze the observed radial velocities of the super shells. We find that the
velocities indeed manifest the statistical spatial correlations expected from
turbulence. The turbulence spectrum is consistent with that obtained by
Goldman(2000).",2007-03-30T13:15:42Z
Contact lines for fluid surface adhesion,"When a fluid surface adheres to a substrate, the location of the contact line
adjusts in order to minimize the overall energy. This adhesion balance implies
boundary conditions which depend on the characteristic surface deformation
energies. We develop a general geometrical framework within which these
conditions can be systematically derived. We treat both adhesion to a rigid
substrate as well as adhesion between two fluid surfaces, and illustrate our
general results for several important Hamiltonians involving both curvature and
curvature gradients. Some of these have previously been studied using very
different techniques, others are to our knowledge new. What becomes clear in
our approach is that, except for capillary phenomena, these boundary conditions
are not the manifestation of a local force balance, even if the concept of
surface stress is properly generalized. Hamiltonians containing higher order
surface derivatives are not just sensitive to boundary translations but also
notice changes in slope or even curvature. Both the necessity and the
functional form of the corresponding additional contributions follow readily
from our treatment.",2007-03-01T10:02:48Z
"Spin dynamics across the superfluid-insulator transition of spinful
  bosons","Bosons with non-zero spin exhibit a rich variety of superfluid and insulating
phases. Most phases support coherent spin oscillations, which have been the
focus of numerous recent experiments. These spin oscillations are Rabi
oscillations between discrete levels deep in the insulator, while deep in the
superfluid they can be oscillations in the orientation of a spinful condensate.
We describe the evolution of spin oscillations across the superfluid-insulator
quantum phase transition. For transitions with an order parameter carrying
spin, the damping of such oscillations is determined by the scaling dimension
of the composite spin operator. For transitions with a spinless order parameter
and gapped spin excitations, we demonstrate that the damping is determined by
an associated quantum impurity problem of a localized spin excitation
interacting with the bulk critical modes. We present a renormalization group
analysis of the quantum impurity problem, and discuss the relationship of our
results to experiments on ultracold atoms in optical lattices.",2007-03-01T16:41:47Z
"Magnetic structure and phase diagram in a spin-chain system:

General rules for for the phase diagram of frustrated Ising chain compounds are

A Consistency Relation in Cosmology,"We provide a consistency relation between cosmological observables in general

"Binding energy of a Cooper pairs with non-zero center of mass momentum
  in d-wave superconductors","The binding energy of Cooper pairs has been calculated for the case of d-wave

"Boundary hopping and the mobility edge in the Anderson model in three

on t but not on the distribution of on-site energies for box and Lorentzian

allowing the description of light-cones and revealing many features of the
underlying causal structure. Possible applications are illustrated by explicit

two-dimensional electron gas on a cylindrical surface. The longitudinal
resistance along the magnetic-field gradient impressed by the surface curvature
was found to vanish if measured along one of the edges of the curved Hall bar.
If the external magnetic field is reversed, then the longitudinal resistance
vanishes at the opposite edge of the Hall bar. This asymmetry is analyzed
quantitatively in terms of the Landauer-Buettiker formalism.",2007-03-23T15:29:24Z
"Dynamics of Charged Particles in the Radio Emission Region of Pulsar
  Magnetosphere","We consider the classical picture of three dimensional motion of charged
particles in pulsar magnetosphere. We adopt a perturbative method to solve the
equation of motion, and find the trajectory of particles as they move along the
rotating dipolar magnetic field lines. Our aim is to study the influence of
rotation on the pulsar radio emission by considering the constrained motion of
particles along the open dipolar magnetic field lines. We find that the
rotation induces a significant curvature into the particle trajectories. Our
model predicts the intensity on leading side dominates over that of trailing
side. We expect that if there is any curvature induced radio emission from the
region close to the magnetic axis then it must be due to the rotation induced

microscopically with an ordered moment ~0.7 \mu_B. As the ground state evolves,
there is no change in the low frequency spin dynamics in the disordered state.
These results suggest that the magnetism emerges locally in the vicinity of the
Cd dopants.",2007-02-01T05:39:09Z
"Classical and quantum two-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg
  antiferromagnets","The classical and the quantum, spin $S=1/2, versions of the uniaxially
anisotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice in a field parallel
to the easy axis are studied using Monte Carlo techniques. For the classical
version, attention is drawn to biconical structures and fluctuations at low
temperatures in the transition region between the antiferromagnetic and
spin-flop phases. For the quantum version, the previously proposed scenario of
a first-order transition between the antiferromagnetic and spin-flop phases
with a critical endpoint and a tricritical point is scrutinized.",2007-03-05T20:32:57Z
Nonaffine rubber elasticity for stiff polymer networks,"We present a theory for the elasticity of cross-linked stiff polymer
networks. Stiff polymers, unlike their flexible counterparts, are highly
anisotropic elastic objects. Similar to mechanical beams stiff polymers easily
deform in bending, while they are much stiffer with respect to tensile forces
(``stretching''). Unlike in previous approaches, where network elasticity is
derived from the stretching mode, our theory properly accounts for the soft
bending response. A self-consistent effective medium approach is used to
calculate the macroscopic elastic moduli starting from a microscopic
characterization of the deformation field in terms of ``floppy modes'' --
low-energy bending excitations that retain a high degree of non-affinity. The
length-scale characterizing the emergent non-affinity is given by the ``fiber
length'' $l_f$, defined as the scale over which the polymers remain straight.
The calculated scaling properties for the shear modulus are in excellent
agreement with the results of recent simulations obtained in two-dimensional
model networks. Furthermore, our theory can be applied to rationalize bulk
rheological data in reconstituted actin networks.",2007-03-03T18:58:04Z
Resonant reflection at magnetic barriers in quantum wires,"The conductance of a quantum wire containing a single magnetic barrier is
studied numerically by means of the recursive Greens function technique. For
sufficiently strong and localized barriers, Fano - type reflection resonances
are observed close to the pinch-off regime. They are attributed to a
magnetoelectric vortex-type quasibound state inside the magnetic barrier that
interferes with an extended mode outside. We furthermore show that disorder can
substantially modify the residual conductance around the pinch-off regime.",2007-01-05T12:23:15Z
Perfect Hashing for Data Management Applications,"Perfect hash functions can potentially be used to compress data in connection
with a variety of data management tasks. Though there has been considerable
work on how to construct good perfect hash functions, there is a gap between
theory and practice among all previous methods on minimal perfect hashing. On
one side, there are good theoretical results without experimentally proven
practicality for large key sets. On the other side, there are the theoretically
analyzed time and space usage algorithms that assume that truly random hash
functions are available for free, which is an unrealistic assumption. In this
paper we attempt to bridge this gap between theory and practice, using a number
of techniques from the literature to obtain a novel scheme that is
theoretically well-understood and at the same time achieves an
order-of-magnitude increase in performance compared to previous ``practical''
methods. This improvement comes from a combination of a novel, theoretically
optimal perfect hashing scheme that greatly simplifies previous methods, and
the fact that our algorithm is designed to make good use of the memory
hierarchy. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by considering a set
of over one billion URLs from the World Wide Web of average length 64, for
which we construct a minimal perfect hash function on a commodity PC in a
little more than 1 hour. Our scheme produces minimal perfect hash functions
using slightly more than 3 bits per key. For perfect hash functions in the
range $\{0,...,2n-1\}$ the space usage drops to just over 2 bits per key (i.e.,
one bit more than optimal for representing the key). This is significantly
below of what has been achieved previously for very large values of $n$.",2007-02-27T20:56:41Z
Single-site Anderson Model. I Diagrammatic theory,"The diagrammatic theory is proposed for the strongly correlated impurity
Anderson model. The strongly correlated impurity electrons are hybridized with
free conduction electrons. For this system the new diagrammatic approach is
formulated. The linked cluster theorem for vacuum diagrams is proved and the
Dyson type equations for electron propagators of both electron subsystems are
established, together with such equations for mixed propagators. The
approximations based on the summing the infinite series of diagrams are
proposed, which close the system of equations and permit the investigation of
the system's properties.",2007-01-13T15:08:05Z
"Synthesis and characterization of core-shell structure silica-coated
  Fe29.5Ni70.5 nanoparticles","In view of potential applications of magnetic particles in biomedicine and
electromagnetic devices, we made use of the classical Stober method
base-catalysed hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) to
encapsulate FeNi nanoparticles within a silica shell. An original stirring
system under high power ultrasounds made possible to disperse the otherwise
agglomerated particles. Sonication guaranteed particles to remain dispersed
during the Stober synthesis and also improved the efficiency of the method. The
coated particles are characterized by electron microscopy (TEM) and
spectroscopy (EDX) showing a core-shell structure with a uniform layer of
silica. Silica-coating does not affect the core magnetic properties. Indeed,
all samples are ferromagnetic at 77 K and room temperature and the Curie point
remains unchanged. Only the coercive force shows an unexpected non-monotonous
dependence on silica layer thickness.",2007-03-19T13:55:31Z
Optimal operation of transition-edge sensors on ballistic membranes,"We calculate the operating parameters of a transition edge sensor that is
mounted on a thin dielectric membrane with the assumption that the phononic
heat transport in the membrane is ballistic. Our treatment uses the correct
phonon modes from elasticity theory (Lamb-modes), and spans the transition from
3D to 2D behavior. The phonon cooling power and conductance have a global
minimum as function of membrane thickness, which leads to an optimal value for
the membrane thickness with respect to noise equivalent power at a fixed
operating temperature. The energy resolution of a calorimeter will not be
affected strongly, but, somewhat counterintuitively, the effective time
constant can be reduced by decreasing the membrane thickness in the 2D limit.",2007-02-23T09:30:32Z
"Statistics of Measurement of Non-commuting Quantum Variables: Monitoring
  and Purification of a qubit","We address continuous weak linear quantum measurement and argue that it is
best understood in terms of statistics of the outcomes of the linear detectors
measuring a quantum system, for example, a qubit. We mostly concentrate on a
setup consisting of a qubit and three independent detectors that simultaneously
monitor three noncommuting operator variables, those corresponding to three
pseudospin components of the qubit. We address the joint probability
distribution of the detector outcomes and the qubit variables. When analyzing
the distribution in the limit of big values of the outcomes, we reveal a high
degree of correspondence between the three outcomes and three components of the
qubit pseudospin after the measurement. This enables a high-fidelity monitoring
of all three components. We discuss the relation between the monitoring
described and the algorithms of quantum information theory that use the results
of the partial measurement. We develop a proper formalism to evaluate the
statistics of continuous weak linear measurement. The formalism is based on
Feynman-Vernon approach, roots in the theory of full counting statistics, and
boils down to a Bloch-Redfield equation augmented with counting fields.",2007-03-13T15:06:48Z
"Reconstructing the Velocity Distribution of WIMPs from Direct Dark
  Matter Detection Data","Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are one of the leading
candidates for dark matter. Currently, the most promising method to detect many
different WIMP candidates is the direct detection of the recoil energy
deposited in a low-background laboratory detector due to elastic WIMP-nucleus
scattering. So far the usual procedure has been to predict the event rate of
direct detection of WIMPs based on some model(s) of the galactic halo. The aim
of our work is to invert this process. That is, we study what future direct
detection experiment can teach us about the WIMP halo. As the first step we
consider a time-averaged recoil spectrum, assuming that no directional
information exists. We develop a method to construct the (time-averaged)
one-dimensional velocity distribution function from this spectrum. Moments of
this function, such as the mean velocity and velocity dispersion of WIMPs, can
also be obtained directly from the recoil spectrum. The only input needed in
addition to a measured recoil spectrum is the mass of the WIMP; no information
about the scattering cross section or WIMP density is required.",2007-03-26T15:08:02Z
Accretion rate and the occurrence of multi-peaked X-ray bursts,"Most Type I X-ray bursts from accreting neutron stars have a lightcurve with
a single peak, but there is a rare population of faint bursts that are double
or even triple peaked. Suggested mechanisms include polar ignition with
equatorial stalling, or multi-step energy release; the latter being caused by
hydrodynamic instabilities or waiting points in the nuclear reaction sequence.
We present an analysis of the accretion rate dependence of the multi-peak
bursts, and discuss the consequences for the various models. The observations
pose particular challenges for the polar ignition mechanism given current
models of ignition latitude dependence.",2007-03-28T15:28:43Z
Hydrogen storage in pillared Li-dispersed boron carbide nanotubes,"Ab initio density-functional theory study suggests that pillared Li-dispersed
boron carbide nanotubes is capable of storing hydrogen with a mass density
higher than 6.0 weight% and a volumetric density higher than 45 g/L. The boron
substitution in carbon nanotube greatly enhances the binding energy of Li atom
to the nanotube, and this binding energy (~ 2.7 eV) is greater than the
cohesive energy of lithium metal (~1.7 eV), preventing lithium from aggregation
(or segregation) at high lithium doping concentration. The adsorption energy of
hydrogen on the Li-dispersed boron carbide nanotube is in the range of 10 ~24
kJ/mol, suitable for reversible H2 adsorption/desorption at room temperature
and near ambient pressure.",2007-03-20T15:38:50Z
Magnetic interaction of jets and molecular clouds in NGC 4258,"NGC 4258 is a well known spiral galaxy with a peculiar large scale jet flow
detected in the radio and in H-alpha. Due to the special geometry of the
galaxy, the jets emerge from the nuclear region through the galactic disk. Also
the distribution of molecular gas looks different from that in other spiral
galaxies: [12]CO(1-0)emission has only been detected in the center and along
the jets and only up to distances of about 50 arcsec (1.8 kpc) from the
nucleus. The reason for the CO concentration along the inner jets in NGC 4258
was not understood and is the motivation for the observations presented here.
Using the IRAM interferometer, we mapped the [12]CO(1-0) emission of the
central part of NGC 4258 along the nuclear jet direction in the inner 3 kpc. We
detected two parallel CO ridges along a position angle of -25 degr with a total
length of about 80 arcsec (2.8 kpc), separated by a CO-depleted funnel with a
width of about 5 arcsec (175 pc). The H-alpha emission is more extended and
broader than the CO emission with its maximum just in between the two CO
ridges. In CO we see a peculiar velocity distribution in the iso-velocity map
and p-v diagrams. We discuss different scenarios for an interpretation and
present a model which can explain the observational results consistently. We
propose here that the concentration of CO along the ridges is due to
interaction of the rotating gas clouds with the jet's magnetic field by
ambipolar diffusion. This magnetic interaction is thought to increase the time
the molecular clouds reside near the jet thus leading to the quasi-static CO
ridge.",2007-03-13T12:20:29Z
"Well defined transition to gel-like aggregates of attractive athermal
  particles","In an attempt to extend the range of model jamming transitions, we simulate
systems of athermal particles which attract when slightly overlapping.
Following from recent work on purely repulsive systems, dynamics are neglected
and relaxation performed via a potential energy minimisation algorithm. Our
central finding is of a transition to a low-density tensile solid which is
sharp in the limit of infinite system size. The critical density depends on the
range of the attractive regime in the pair-potential. Furthermore, solidity is
shown to be related to the coordination number of the packing according to the
approximate constraint-counting scheme known as Maxwell counting, although more
corrections need to be considered than with the repulsive-only case, as
explained. We finish by discussing how the numerical difficulties encountered
in this work could be overcome in future studies.",2007-01-04T04:36:37Z
Initial conditions for disc galaxies,"We present a general recipe for constructing N-body realizations of galaxies
comprised of near-spherical and disc components. First, an exact spherical
distribution function for the spheroids (halo & bulge) is determined, such that
it is in equilibrium with the gravitational monopole of the disc components.
Second, an N-body realisation of this model is adapted to the full disc
potential by growing the latter adiabatically from its monopole. Finally, the
disc is sampled with particles drawn from an appropriate distribution function,
avoiding local-Maxwellian approximations. We performed test simulations and
find that the halo and bulge radial density profile very closely match their
target model, while they become slightly oblate due to the added disc gravity.
Our findings suggest that vertical thickening of the initially thin disc is
caused predominantly by spiral and bar instabilities, which also result in a
radial re-distribution of matter, rather than scattering off interloping
massive halo particles.",2007-03-20T17:02:53Z
"New Calculations of Recombination Rates for Cold $^4$He Atoms and
  Determination of Universal Scaling Functions","Three-body recombination rates for cold $^4$He are calculated with a new
method which exploits the simple relationship between the imaginary part of the
atom-dimer elastic scattering phase shift and the $S$-matrix for recombination.
The elastic phase shifts are computed above breakup threshold by solving a
three-body Faddeev equation in momentum space with inputs based on a variety of
modern atom-atom potentials. Recombination coefficients for the HFD-B3-FCII
potential agree very well with the only previously published results. Since the
elastic scattering and recombination processes for $^4$He are governed by
""Efimov physics"", they depend on universal functions of a scaling variable. The
newly computed recombination coefficients for potentials other than HFD-B3-FCII
make it possible to determine these universal functions for the first time.",2007-02-12T21:54:01Z
Size distribution and structure of Barchan dune fields,"Barchans are isolated mobile dunes often organized in large dune fields. Dune
fields seem to present a characteristic dune size and spacing, which suggests a
cooperative behavior based on dune interaction. In Duran et al. (2009), we
propose that the redistribution of sand by collisions between dunes is a key
element for the stability and size selection of barchan dune fields. This
approach was based on a mean-field model ignoring the spatial distribution of
dune fields. Here, we present a simplified dune field model that includes the
spatial evolution of individual dunes as well as their interaction through sand
exchange and binary collisions. As a result, the dune field evolves towards a
steady state that depends on the boundary conditions. Comparing our results
with measurements of Moroccan dune fields, we find that the simulated fields
have the same dune size distribution as in real fields but fail to reproduce
their homogeneity along the wind direction.",2007-01-16T10:37:22Z
"The Gaussian multiple access wire-tap channel: wireless secrecy and
  cooperative jamming","We consider the General Gaussian Multiple Access Wire-Tap Channel (GGMAC-WT).
In this scenario, multiple users communicate with an intended receiver in the
presence of an intelligent and informed eavesdropper. We define two suitable
secrecy measures, termed individual and collective, to reflect the confidence
in the system for this multi-access environment. We determine achievable rates
such that secrecy to some pre-determined degree can be maintained, using
Gaussian codebooks. We also find outer bounds for the case when the
eavesdropper receives a degraded version of the intended receiver's signal. In
the degraded case, Gaussian codewords are shown to achieve the sum capacity for
collective constraints. In addition, a TDMA scheme is shown to also achieve sum
capacity for both sets of constraints. Numerical results showing the new rate
region are presented and compared with the capacity region of the Gaussian
Multiple-Access Channel (GMAC) with no secrecy constraints. We then find the
secrecy sum-rate maximizing power allocations for the transmitters, and show
that a cooperative jamming scheme can be used to increase achievable rates in
this scenario.",2007-02-09T01:10:10Z
Quantum melting of a crystal of dipolar bosons,"We investigate the behaviour of dipolar bosons in two dimensions. We describe
the large density crystalline limit analytically while we use quantum
Monte-Carlo to study the melting toward the Bose-Einstein condensate. We find
strong evidence for a first order transition. We characterize the window of
experimentally accessible parameters in the context of ultracold bosons and
show that observing the quantum melting should be within grasp once one is able
to form cold heteronuclear molecules. Close to the melting, we can not conclude
on the existence of a supersolid phase due to an insufficient overlap of our
variational Bijl-Jastrow Ansatz with the actual ground state.",2007-03-23T14:35:50Z
"The survival probability of a branching random walk in presence of an
  absorbing wall","A branching random walk in presence of an absorbing wall moving at a constant
velocity v undergoes a phase transition as v varies. The problem can be
analyzed using the properties of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov
(F-KPP) equation. We find that the survival probability of the branching random
walk vanishes at a critical velocity v_c of the wall with an essential
singularity and we characterize the divergences of the relaxation times for
v<v_c and v>v_c. At v=v_c the survival probability decays like a stretched
exponential. Using the F-KPP equation, one can also calculate the distribution
of the population size at time t conditionned by the survival of one individual
at a later time T>t. Our numerical results indicate that the size of the
population diverges like the exponential of (v_c-v)^{-1/2} in the
quasi-stationary regime below v_c. Moreover for v>v_c, our data indicate that
there is no quasi-stationary regime.",2007-03-13T22:17:52Z
Disorder Enhanced Spin Polarization in Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors,"We present a theoretical study of diluted magnetic semiconductors that
includes spin-orbit coupling within a realistic host band structure and treats
explicitly the effects of disorder due to randomly substituted Mn ions. While
spin-orbit coupling reduces the spin polarization by mixing different spin
states in the valence bands, we find that disorder from Mn ions enhances the
spin polarization due to formation of ferromagnetic impurity clusters and
impurity bound states. The disorder leads to large effects on the hole carriers
which form impurity bands as well as hybridizing with the valence band. For Mn
doping 0.01 < x < 0.04, the system is metallic with a large effective mass and
low mobility.",2007-02-24T06:37:56Z
"The SAURON project -- IX. A kinematic classification for early-type
  galaxies","2D stellar kinematics of 48 representative E and S0 galaxies obtained with
the SAURON IFS reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours,
depending on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. We define
a new parameter LambdaR which involves luminosity weighted averages over the
full 2D kinematic field, as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellar
angular momentum per unit mass. We use it as a basis for a new kinematic
classification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators
(SRs, FRs), depending on whether they have LambdaR values within their
effective radius Re below or above 0.1, respectively. SRs and FRs are shown to
be physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the
consequence of a biased viewing angle. FRs tend to be relatively low luminosity
galaxies. SRs tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are still
spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. 3 slow rotators of our sample,
among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. Remarkably, all
other SRs contain a large kpc-scale KDC. All FRs show well aligned photometric
and kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most SRs which
exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. In a companion paper
(Paper X), we also show that FRs and SRs are distinct classes in terms of their
orbital distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formation
and evolution of FRs, and that the slowest rotators are the extreme
evolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells where
dissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which most
of the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards. (abridged)",2007-03-20T17:07:13Z
"Nano Ferrites Microwave Complex Permeability and Permittivity
  Measurements by T/R Technique in Waveguide","There is a huge demand to accurately determine the magneto-electrical
properties of particles in the nano sized regime due to the modern IC
technology revolution and biomedical application science. In this paper, we
present a microwave waveguide measurement technique for complex permeability
and permittivity of expensive nano sized magnetic powder materials. In the
measurement process, Agilents 8510C vector network analyzer was used to have a
standard TRL calibration for free space inside the waveguides. In order to
maintain the recommended insertion phase range, a very thin prepared sample was
loaded inside the calibrated waveguide. Also, the loaded materials magnetic and
dielectric effects were considered into the cutoff wavelength of the
propagation constant of the TE10 wave from the geometrical dimensions of the
waveguides. This makes the measured permeability and permittivity more reliable
than commonly used techniques. The six different compounds of nano sized
ferrite powders (Fe3O4, CuFe2O4, CuFe2O4Zn, Fe2NiO3Zn, BaFe12O19, and
SrFe12O19), in which the average diameter of nano particles is less than 40nm
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc for measurement purposes employing this
technique. For industrial benefits, we present the complex permeability and
permittivity on the frequency range from 3.95GHz to 5.85GHz. The measured
results showed that the dielectric permittivity of these materials is quite
different from those of solid state materials. Index Terms, Nano ferrites,

"Redistributing Chern numbers of Landau subbands: tight-binding electrons
  under staggered-modulated magnetic fields","We investigate the magneto-transport properties of electrons on a square
lattice under a magnetic field with the alternate flux strength
$\phi\pm\Delta\phi$ in neighboring plaquettes. A new peculiar behavior of the
Hall conductance has been found and is robust against weak disorder: if
$\phi={p\over{2N}}\times{2\pi}$ ($p$ and $2N$ are coprime integers) is fixed,
the Chern numbers of Landau subbands will be redistributed between neighboring
pairs and hence the total quantized Hall conductance exhibits a direct
transition by $\pm{N}e^2/h$ at critical fillings when $\Delta\phi$ is increased
from 0 up to a critical value $\Delta\phi_c$. This effect can be an
experimental probe of the staggered-flux phase.",2007-03-19T09:19:31Z
"Field-induced paramagnons at the metamagnetic transition in
  Ca1.8Sr0.2RuO4","The magnetic excitations in Ca1.8Sr0.2RuO4 were studied across the
metamagnetic transition and as a function of temperature using inelastic
neutron scattering. At low temperature and low magnetic field the magnetic
response is dominated by a complex superposition of incommensurate
antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Upon increasing the magnetic field across the
metamagnetic ransition, paramagnon and finally well-defined magnon scattering
is induced, partially suppressing the incommensurate signals. The high-field
phase in Ca1.8Sr0.2RuO4 has, therefore, to be considered as an intrinsically
ferromagnetic state stabilized by the magnetic field.",2007-03-30T09:32:54Z
Probing the sp^2 dependence of elastic moduli in ultrahard diamond films,"The structural and elastic properties of diamond nanocomposites and
ultrananocrystalline diamond films (UNCD) are investigated using both empirical
potentials and tight binding schemes. We find that both materials are extremely
hard, but their superb diamondlike properties are limited by their sp^2
component. In diamond composites, the sp^2 atoms are found in the matrix and
far from the interface with the inclusion, and they are responsible for the
softening of the material. In UNCD, the sp^2 atoms are located in the grain
boundaries. They offer relaxation mechanisms which relieve the strain but, on
the other hand, impose deformations that lead to softening. The higher the sp^2
component the less rigid these materials are.",2007-02-20T17:40:50Z
"Nonperturbative Dynamical Theory and A Scheme for Nonequilibrium

"Bond-Propagation Algorithm for Thermodynamic Functions in General 2D
  Ising Models","Recently, we developed and implemented the bond propagation algorithm for
calculating the partition function and correlation functions of random bond
Ising models in two dimensions. The algorithm is the fastest available for
calculating these quantities near the percolation threshold. In this paper, we
show how to extend the bond propagation algorithm to directly calculate
thermodynamic functions by applying the algorithm to derivatives of the
partition function, and we derive explicit expressions for this transformation.
We also discuss variations of the original bond propagation procedure within
the larger context of Y-Delta-Y-reducibility and discuss the relation of this
class of algorithm to other algorithms developed for Ising systems. We conclude
with a discussion on the outlook for applying similar algorithms to other
models.",2007-03-01T22:31:08Z
Left-handed Ferromagnet,"The dynamics of the total magnetization in metallic ferromagnet is studied

a pressure-induced quantum phase transition from a gapped ground state to an
antiferromagnetic state at a critical pressure of $P_{\rm c} \simeq 8.2$ kbar.
Magnetic excitations in KCuCl$_3$ at a hydrostatic pressure of 4.7 kbar have
been investigated by conducting neutron inelastic scattering experiments using
a newly designed cylindrical high-pressure clamp cell. A well-defined single
excitation mode is observed. The softening of the excitation mode due to the

Density of near-extreme events,"We provide a quantitative analysis of the phenomenon of crowding of
near-extreme events by computing exactly the density of states (DOS) near the
maximum of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables.
We show that the mean DOS converges to three different limiting forms depending
on whether the tail of the distribution of the random variables decays slower
than, faster than, or as a pure exponential function. We argue that some of
these results would remain valid even for certain {\em correlated} cases and
verify it for power-law correlated stationary Gaussian sequences. Satisfactory
agreement is found between the near-maximum crowding in the summer temperature
reconstruction data of western Siberia and the theoretical prediction.",2007-01-16T13:33:05Z

excitations in a system can be obtained. This observation is supported by
analysis of several integrable models and we argue that it is valid for
non-integrable models as well. Our conclusions are supplemented by performing
exact numerical simulations on finite systems. We propose that measuring power

First X-ray observations of the young pulsar J1357-6429,"The first short Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the young and
energetic pulsar J1357-6429 provided strong indications of a tail-like
pulsar-wind nebula associated with this object, as well as pulsations of its
X-ray flux with a pulsed fraction above 50% and a thermal component dominating
at lower photon energies (below 2 keV). The elongated nebula is very compact in
size and may be interpreted as evidence for a pulsar jet. The thermal radiation
is most plausibly emitted from the entire neutron star surface of a 10 km
radius and a 1.0+/-0.1 K temperature, covered with a magnetized hydrogen
atmosphere. At higher energies the pulsar's emission is of a nonthermal
(magnetospheric) origin, with a power-law spectrum of a photon index of
1.1-1.3. This makes the X-ray properties of PSR J1357-6429 very similar to

discuss different possible forms of particle injection such as burst-like
injection, continuous injection for a finite time, injection from a stationary
source and energy dependent injection. When applied to the nearby known
supernova remnants, we find that the observed CR anisotropy data favour the
burst-like particle injection model for the CR diffusion coefficient
$D(E)\propto E^a$ with $a=0.3-0.6$ in the local region. In the study we have
also found that the contribution of the sources G114.3+0.3 and Monogem dominate
if the observed anisotropy is a result of the effect of the nearby sources.
Further study shows that we should not neglect the contribution of the
undetected old sources to the local CR anisotropy.",2007-03-08T10:40:38Z
"Photochemical generation of E' centre from Si-H in amorphous SiO2 under
  pulsed ultraviolet laser radiation","In situ optical absorption spectroscopy was used to study the generation of
E' centres in amorphous SiO_2 occurring by photo-induced breaking of Si-H
groups under 4.7eV pulsed laser radiation. The dependence from laser intensity
of the defect generation rate is consistent with a two-photon mechanism for
Si-H rupture, while the growth and the saturation of the defects are
conditioned by their concurrent annealing due to reaction with mobile hydrogen
arising from the same precursor. A rate equation is proposed to model the
kinetics of the defects and tested on experimental data.",2007-03-02T13:57:06Z
Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory of the Periodic Anderson Model,"We develop a cluster dynamical mean field theory of the periodic Anderson
model in three dimensions, taking a cluster of two sites as a basic reference
frame. The mean field theory displays the basic features of the Doniach phase
diagram: a paramagnetic Fermi liquid state, an antiferromagnetic state and a
transition between them.
  In contrast with spin density wave theories, the transition is accompanied by
a large increase of the effective mass everywhere on the Fermi surface and a
substantial change of the Fermi surface shape across the transition. To
understand the nature and the origin of the phases near the transition, we
investigate the paramagnetic solution underlying the antiferromagnetic state,
and identify the transition as a point where the $f$ electrons decouple from
the conduction electrons undergoing an orbitally selective Mott transition.
This point turns out to be intimately related to the two impurity Kondo model
quantum critical point. In this regime, non local correlations become important
and result in significant changes in the photoemission spectra and the de
Haas-van Alphen frequencies. The transition involves considerable $f$ spectral
weight transfer from the Fermi level to its immediate vicinity, rather than to
the Hubbard bands as in single site DMFT.",2007-02-23T21:07:46Z
Optical evidence for heavy charge carriers in FeGe,"The optical spectrum of the cubic helimagnetic metal FeGe has been
investigated in the frequency range from 0.01 - 3.1 eV for different
temperatures from 30 K to 296 K. The optical conductivity shows the evolution
of a low energy (0.22 eV) interband transition and the development of a narrow
free carrier response with a strong energy and temperature dependence. The
frequency dependent effective mass and scattering rate derived from the optical
data indicate the formation of dressed quasi-particles with a mass
renormalization factor of 12. Similar to FeSi the spectral weight in FeGe is
not recovered over a broad frequency range, an effect usually attributed to the
influence of the on-site Coulomb interaction.",2007-02-14T20:35:00Z
Breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein Relation in Supercooled Water,"Supercooled water exhibits a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation
between the diffusion constant $D$ and the alpha relaxation time
$\tau_{\alpha}$. For water simulated with the TIP5P and ST2 potentials, we find
that the temperature of the decoupling of diffusion and alpha relaxation
correlates with the temperature of the maximum in specific heat that
corresponds to crossing the Widom line $T_W(P)$. Specifically, we find that our
results for $D\tau_{\alpha}/T$ collapse onto a single master curve if
temperature is replaced by $T-T_W(P)$, where $T_W(P)$ is the temperature where
the constant-pressure specific heat achieves a maximum. Also, we find agreement
between our ST2 simulations and experimental values of $D\tau_{\alpha}/T$. We
further find that the size of the mobile molecule clusters (dynamical
heterogeneities) increases sharply near $T_W(P)$. Moreover, our calculations of
mobile particle cluster size $<n(t^*)>_w$ for different pressures, where $t^*$
is the time for which the mobile particle cluster size is largest, also
collapse onto a single master curve if $T$ is replaced by $T-T_W(P)$. The
crossover to a more locally structured low density liquid (LDL) environment as
$T\to T_W(P)$ appears to be well correlated with both the breakdown of the
Stokes-Einstein relation and the growth of dynamic heterogeneities.",2007-02-06T14:00:44Z
"Dispersion of the odd magnetic resonant mode in near-optimally doped
  Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d","We report a neutron scattering study of the spin excitation spectrum in the
superconducting state of slightly overdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d system (Tc=87 K).
We focus on the dispersion of the resonance peak in the superconducting state
that is due to a S=1 collective mode. The measured spin excitation spectrum
bears a strong similarity to the spectrum of the YBa2Cu3O6+x system for a
similar doping level i.e. x= 0.95-1), which consists of intersecting upward-
and downward-dispersing branches. A close comparison of the threshold of the
electron-hole spin flip continuum, deduced from angle resolved photo-emission
measurements in the same system, indicates that the magnetic response in the
superconducting state is confined, in both energy and momentum, below the
gapped Stoner continuum. In contrast to YBa2Cu3O6+x, the spin excitation
spectrum is broader than the experimental resolution. In the framework of an
itinerant-electron model, we quantitatively relate this intrinsic energy width
to the superconducting gap distribution observed in scanning tunnelling
microscopy experiments. Our study further suggests a significant in-plane
anisotropy of the magnetic response.",2007-01-03T17:18:59Z
"Enhancing the spin-transfer torque through proximity of quantum well
  states","We predict that the spin-transfer, $T_{i,||}$, and field-like, $T_{i,\bot}$,
components of the {\it local} spin torque are dramatically enhanced in
double-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions. The {\it spin-mixing} enhancement is
due to the energetic proximity of majority and minority quantum well states
(QWS) of different quantum numbers within the bias window. $T_{i,||}$ exhibits
a switch-on and switch-off step-like bias behavior when spin polarized QWS
enter the bias window or exit the energy band, while $T_{i,\bot}$, changes sign
between switch-on biases. The {\it net} $T_{\bot}$ exhibits an anomalous
angular behavior due to the bias interplay of the bilinear and biquadratic
effective exchange couplings.",2007-03-29T20:00:06Z
Valence Bond Entanglement Entropy,"We introduce for SU(2) quantum spin systems the Valence Bond Entanglement
Entropy as a counting of valence bond spin singlets shared by two subsystems.
For a large class of antiferromagnetic systems, it can be calculated in all
dimensions with Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the valence bond basis. We
show numerically that this quantity displays all features of the von Neumann
entanglement entropy for several one-dimensional systems. For two-dimensional
Heisenberg models, we find a strict area law for a Valence Bond Solid state and
multiplicative logarithmic corrections for the Neel phase.",2007-03-01T16:10:49Z
Replica mean-field theory for Levy spin-glasses,"Infinite-range spin-glass models with Levy-distributed interactions show a
freezing transition similar to disordered spin systems on finite connectivity
random graphs. It is shown that despite diverging moments of the local field
distribution this transition can be analyzed within the replica approach by
working at imaginary temperature and using a variant of the replica method
developed for diluted systems and optimization problems. The replica-symmetric
self-consistent equation for the distribution of local fields illustrates how
the long tail in the distribution of coupling strengths gives rise to a
significant fraction of strong bonds per spin which form a percolating backbone
at the transition temperature.",2007-01-10T10:53:28Z
DNA toroid condensation as analytic solutions,"It now becomes apparent that condensed DNA toroid which emerges in a poor
solvent condition can be realised in the framework of the non-linear sigma
model on a line segment. In fact, the classical solutions of the model, i.e.,
of the bending potential exhibit toroidal forms, and fit well with the
delta-function term of the attractive interaction. The proposed theory is in
good agreement with experimental observations that the toroid is the ground
state. In this paper, we give a rigorous proof that the solutions are indeed
the exact solutions of the equations of motion with the first derivatives of
the attractive interaction term. We also show a refined mapping to experimental
data, considering the finite size effects of the cross section and of the chain
length.",2007-01-30T09:04:30Z
"Galaxy Evolution from Halo Occupation Distribution Modeling of DEEP2 and
  SDSS Galaxy Clustering","We model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function of
DEEP2 (z~1) and SDSS (z~0) galaxies within the Halo Occupation Distribution
(HOD) framework. At both epochs, there is a tight correlation between central
galaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing for
larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreasing at higher
luminosity. Central L* galaxies reside in halos a few times more massive at z~1
than at z~0. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of
host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same
luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions
of the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between
the galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z~0 central galaxies to
z~1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos, which enables us to
study the evolution of galaxies as a function of halo mass. We find that the
stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority
of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z~0 low mass halos
(~5x10^11 Msun/h) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central
galaxies of high mass halos (~10^13 Msun/h) result from star formation between
z~1 and z~0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation
efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time.
Future work can combine HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different
redshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter
halos. This can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both
mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful
tests of galaxy formation theories. (Abridged).",2007-03-16T20:05:04Z
"Magnetic-field cycling induced anomalous irreversibility in resistivity
  of charge-ordered manganites","The rare-earth ions (RE = Eu, Dy Ho, Tm, Y) substituted charge-ordered
antiferromagnetic manganites, Pr0.45RE0.05Ca0.5MnO3, were studied for the
magnetic and the transport properties in the presence of external
magnetic-fields of up to 14 Tesla. Regardless of the intrinsic magnetic
property of RE ions, all the compounds exhibit successive step-like
metamagnetic transitions at low temperatures, which are strongly correlated to
their electronic transitions. At any fixed temperature in two different
temperature-regimes, we observed contrary effects of the magnetic-field cycling
on the resistivity of these manganites, namely, i) in the low temperature
regime (<70 K), the resistivity was irreversible showing lower values than
initial after a magnetic-field cycle was over, which is consistent with the
irreversible magnetization, and ii) in a temperature regime above 70 K, the
resistivity is irreversible with noticeably higher values than initial, whereas
the magnetization was found to be reversible. For the latter case, we further
show that this irreversibility of resistivity systematically depends on the
temperature and the magnitude of applied magnetic-field. These results suggest
that the observed resistivity behavior originated from the magnetic-field
induced metamagnetic transitions and training effect.",2007-03-29T02:04:36Z
"Quantitative comparison between Type Ia supernova spectra at low and
  high redshifts: A case study","We develop a method to measure the strength of the absorption features in
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) spectra and use it to make a quantitative comparison
between the spectra of Type Ia supernovae at low and high redshifts. In this
case study, we apply the method to 12 high-redshift (0.212 < z < 0.912) SNe Ia
observed by the Supernova Cosmology Project . Through measurements of the
strengths of these features and of the blueshift of the absorption minimum in
Ca II H&K, we show that the spectra of the high-redshift SNe Ia are
quantitatively similar to spectra of nearby SNe Ia (z < 0.15). One supernova in
our high redshift sample, SN 2002fd at z=0.279, is found to have spectral
characteristics that are associated with peculiar SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like
supernovae.",2007-03-24T10:09:59Z
"Phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations with
  planewaves and pseudopotentials--applications to atoms and molecules","The phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AF QMC) method [S. Zhang
and H. Krakauer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 136401 (2003)] is used to carry out a
systematic study of the dissociation and ionization energies of second-row
group 3A-7A atoms and dimers, Al, Si, P, S, Cl. In addition, the P_2 dimer is
compared to the third-row As_2 dimer, which is also triply-bonded. This method
projects the many-body ground state by means of importance-sampled random walks
in the space of Slater determinants. The Monte Carlo phase problem, due to the
electron-electron Coulomb interaction, is controlled via the phaseless
approximation, with a trial wave function |Psi_T>. As in previous calculations,
a mean-field single Slater determinant is used as |Psi_T>. The method is
formulated in the Hilbert space defined by any chosen one-particle basis. The
present calculations use a planewave basis under periodic boundary conditions
with norm-conserving pseudopotentials. Computational details of the planewave
AF QMC method are presented. The isolated systems chosen here allow a
systematic study of the various algorithmic issues. We show the accuracy of the
planewave method and discuss its convergence with respect to parameters such as
the supercell size and planewave cutoff. The use of standard norm-conserving
pseudopotentials in the many-body AF QMC framework is examined.",2007-02-05T17:31:44Z
Delay and Throughput Optimal Scheduling for OFDM Broadcast Channels,"In this paper a scheduling policy is presented which minimizes the average
delay of the users. The scheduling scheme is investigated both by analysis and
simulations carried out in the context of Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) broadcast channels (BC). First the delay optimality is
obtained for a static scenario providing solutions for specific subproblems,
then the analysis is carried over to the dynamic scheme. Furthermore auxiliary
tools are given for proving throughput optimality. Finally simulations show the
superior performance of the presented scheme.",2007-03-08T11:44:32Z
Initial mass function effects on the colour evolution of disk galaxies,"In this work, we want to find out if the IMF can be determined from colour
images, integrated colours, or mass-to-light ratios, especially at high
redshift, where galaxies cannot be resolved into individual stars, which would
enable us to investigate dependencies of the IMF on cosmological epoch. We use
chemo-dynamical models to investigate the influence of the Initial Mass
Function (IMF) on the evolution of a Milky Way-type disk galaxy, in particular
of its colours. We find that the effect of the IMF on the internal gas
absorption is larger than its effect on the light from the stellar content.
However, the two effects work in the opposite sense: An IMF with more high mass
stars leads to brighter and bluer star-light, but also to more interstellar
dust and thus to more absorption, causing a kind of ""IMF degeneracy"". The most
likely wavelength region in which to detect IMF effects is the infrared (i. e.,
JHK). We also provide photometric absorption and inclination corrections in the
SDSS ugriz and the HST WFPC2 and NICMOS systems.",2007-03-28T15:19:05Z
Morphological stability of electromigration-driven vacancy islands,"The electromigration-induced shape evolution of two-dimensional vacancy
islands on a crystal surface is studied using a continuum approach. We consider
the regime where mass transport is restricted to terrace diffusion in the
interior of the island. In the limit of fast attachment/detachment kinetics a
circle translating at constant velocity is a stationary solution of the
problem. In contrast to earlier work [O. Pierre-Louis and T.L. Einstein, Phys.
Rev. B 62, 13697 (2000)] we show that the circular solution remains linearly
stable for arbitrarily large driving forces. The numerical solution of the full
nonlinear problem nevertheless reveals a fingering instability at the trailing
end of the island, which develops from finite amplitude perturbations and
eventually leads to pinch-off. Relaxing the condition of instantaneous
attachment/detachment kinetics, we obtain non-circular elongated stationary
shapes in an analytic approximation which compares favorably to the full
numerical solution.",2007-01-10T16:41:44Z
"Structural distortion and magnetism of BiFeO3 epitaxial thin films: a
  Raman spectroscopy and neutron diffraction study","A previous study of the growth conditions has shown that single-phase BiFeO3
thin films can only be obtained in a narrow pressure-temperature window and
that these films display a weak magnetic moment. Here we study in more detail
the structure and the magnetism of single-phase BiFeO3 films by means of
reciprocal space mapping, Raman spectroscopy and neutron diffraction. X-ray and
Raman data suggest that the BiFeO3 structure is tetragonal for 70 nm-thick
films and changes to monoclinic for 240 nm-thick films, thus remaining
different from that of the bulk (rhombohedral) structure. In the 240 nm
monoclinically distorted film neutron diffraction experiments allow the
observation of a G-type antiferromagnetic order as in bulk single crystals.
However, the satellite peaks associated with the long-wavelength cycloid
present in bulk BiFeO3 are not observed. The relevance of these findings for
the exploitation of the magnetoelectric properties of BiFeO3 is discussed.",2007-01-22T11:15:34Z

The Triple-Ring Nebula around SN1987A: Fingerprint of a binary merger,"Supernova 1987A, the first naked-eye supernova observed since Kepler's
supernova in 1604, defies a number of theoretical expectations. Its anomalies
have long been attributed to a merger between two massive stars that occurred
some 20,000 years before the explosion, but so far there has been no conclusive
proof that this merger took place. Here, we present three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of the mass ejection associated with such a merger
and the subsequent evolution of the ejecta, and we show that this accurately
reproduces the properties of the triple-ring nebula surrounding the supernova.",2007-03-13T19:49:34Z
"Structural transitions and arrest of domain growth in sheared binary
  immiscible fluids and microemulsions","We investigate spinodal decomposition and structuring effects in binary
immiscible and ternary amphiphilic fluid mixtures under shear by means of three
dimensional lattice Boltzmann simulations. We show that the growth of
individual fluid domains can be arrested by adding surfactant to the system,
thus forming a bicontinous microemulsion. We demonstrate that the maximum
domain size and the time of arrest depend linearly on the concentration of
amphiphile molecules. In addition, we find that for a well defined threshold
value of amphiphile concentration, the maximum domain size and time of complete
arrest do not change. For systems under constant and oscillatory shear we
analyze domain growth rates in directions parallel and perpendicular to the
applied shear. We find a structural transition from a sponge to a lamellar
phase by applying a constant shear and the occurrence of tubular structures
under oscillatory shear. The size of the resulting lamellae and tubes depends
strongly on the amphiphile concentration, shear rate and shear frequency.",2007-01-15T12:40:04Z
"Soliton Wall Superlattice in Quasi-One-Dimensional Conductor
  (Per)2Pt(mnt)2","We suggest a model to explain the appearance of a high resistance high
magnetic field charge-density-wave (CDW) phase, discovered by D. Graf et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. v. 93, 076406 (2004)] in (Per)2Pt(mnt)2. In particular, we
show that the Pauli spin-splitting effects improve the nesting properties of a
realistic quasi-one-dimensional electron spectrum and, therefore, a high
resistance Peierls CDW phase is stabilized in high magnetic fields. In low and
very high magnetic fields, a periodic soliton wall superlattice (SWS) phase is
found to be a ground state. We suggest experimental studies of the predicted
phase transitions between the Peierls and SWS CDW phases in (Per)2Pt(mnt)2 to
discover a unique SWS phase.",2007-02-21T17:31:26Z
"Unconventional superconductors under rotating magnetic field II: thermal
  transport","We present a microscopic approach to the calculations of thermal conductivity
in unconventional superconductors for a wide range of temperatures and magnetic
fields. Our work employs the non-equilibrium Keldysh formulation of the
quasiclassical theory. We solve the transport equations using a variation of
the Brandt-Pesch-Tewordt (BPT) method, that accounts for the quasiparticle
scattering on vortices. We focus on the dependence of the thermal conductivity
on the direction of the field with the respect to the nodes of the order
parameter, and discuss it in the context of experiments aiming to determine the
shape of the gap from such anisotropy measurements. We consider quasi-two
dimensional Fermi surfaces with vertical line nodes and use our analysis to
establish the location of gap nodes in heavy fermion CeCoIn$_5$ and organic
superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu(NCS)$_2$.",2007-02-08T21:13:12Z
"Mixed symmetry localized modes and breathers in binary mixtures of
  Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices","We study localized modes in binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates
embedded in one-dimensional optical lattices. We report a diversity of
asymmetric modes and investigate their dynamics. We concentrate on the cases
where one of the components is dominant, i.e. has much larger number of atoms
than the other one, and where both components have the numbers of atoms of the
same order but different symmetries. In the first case we propose a method of
systematic obtaining the modes, considering the ""small"" component as
bifurcating from the continuum spectrum. A generalization of this approach
combined with the use of the symmetry of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations
allows obtaining breather modes, which are also presented.",2007-02-14T14:28:49Z
Orientational relaxation in a discotic liquid crystal,"We investigate orientational relaxation of a model discotic liquid crystal,
consists of disc-like molecules, by molecular dynamics simulations along two
isobars starting from the high temperature isotropic phase. The two isobars
have been so chosen that (A) the phase sequence isotropic (I)-nematic
(N)-columnar (C) appears upon cooling along one of them and (B) the sequence
isotropic (I)-columnar (C) along the other. While the orientational relaxation
in the isotropic phase near the I-N phase transition in system (A) shows a
power law decay at short to intermediate times, such power law relaxation is
not observed in the isotropic phase near the I-C phase boundary in system (B).
In order to understand this difference (the existence or the absence of the
power law decay), we calculated the the growth of the orientational pair
distribution functions (OPDF) near the I-N phase boundary and also near the I-C
phase boundary. We find that OPDF shows a marked growth in long range
correlation as the I-N phase boundary is approached in the I-N-C system (A),
but such a growth is absent in the I-C system, which appears to be consistent
with the result that I-N phase transition in the former is weakly first order
while the the I-C phase transition in the later is not weak. As the system
settles into the nematic phase, the decay of the single-particle second-rank
orientational OTCF follows a pattern that is similar to what is observed with
calamitic liquid crystals and supercooled molecular liquids.",2007-03-08T22:15:06Z
Magnetic Phase Control in Monolayer Films by Substrate Tuning,"We propose to tailor exchange interactions in magnetic monolayer films by
tuning the adjacent non-magnetic substrate. As an example, we demonstrate a
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transition for one monolayer Fe on a
Ta(x)W(1-x)(001) surface as a function of the Ta concentration. At the critical
Ta concentration, the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is small and the
magnetic phase space is dramatically broadened. Complex magnetic order such as
spin-spirals, multiple-Q, or even disordered local moment states can occur,
offering the possibility to store information in terms of ferromagnetic dots in
an otherwise zero-magnetization state matrix.",2007-01-11T13:35:35Z
Generalized Hawking-Page Phase Transition,"The issue of radiant spherical black holes being in stable thermal

equilibrium statistical mechanical analysis incorporating Gaussian thermal
fluctuations in a canonical ensemble of isolated horizons, the heat capacity is
shown to diverge at a critical value of the classical mass of the isolated
horizon, given (in Planckian units) by the {\it microcanonical} entropy
calculated using Loop Quantum Gravity. The analysis reproduces the Hawking-Page
phase transition discerned for anti-de Sitter black holes and generalizes it in

"Spectroscopic fingerprints of the frustrated magnetic order in
  Li2VOSiO4: a t-J model study","We have analyzed theoretically the photoemission spectra of the insulating

experimental realization of the frustrated J1-J2 Heisenberg model. Although it
is well known that Li2VOSiO4 is magnetically ordered in a collinear arrangement
below TN=2.8 K, there is some controversy about the coexistence of two
collinear phases above TN. Using a generalized t-J model we have obtained a
complex spectral structure that can be traced back to the underlying collinear
magnetic structures. We discuss the possibility to use ARPES experiments as a
way to discern among the different scenarios proposed in the literature.",2007-03-08T18:32:59Z
Raman/Cr3+ Fluorescence Mapping of Melt-Grown Al2o3/Gdalo3 Eutectics,"The paper reports on the Raman/fluorescence study of melt-grown Al2O3/GdAlO3
eutectic composites. Raman bands from the &#61537;-alumina and gadolinium
perovskite phases identified by X-ray diffraction were systematically observed
together in the domains optically visible, even when the latter were much
larger than the Raman probe. This suggests a more complex interlocking pattern
than appearing on SEM or optical microscopy images. The polarization of alumina
and GdAlO3 Raman bands evidenced the preferential orientation of Al2O3 phase
with respect to the sample growth direction, in agreement with TEM results. In
addition, the position of chromium impurity fluorescence bands was used to map
the residual stress in alumina phase. It is a compression in the 200-300 MPa
range.",2007-01-15T20:44:43Z
Towards a New ODE Solver Based on Cartan's Equivalence Method,"The aim of the present paper is to propose an algorithm for a new ODE--solver

Propagating Star Formation in the Collisional Ring Galaxy Arp 10,"Propagating star formation in a collisional ring galaxy Arp10 is investigated
by a complex approach, which includes the broad- and narrow-band photometry,
long- slit spectroscopy, and scanning Fabry-Perot spectroscopy. The ionized gas
velocity field obtained with best spatial resolution to date indicates a non-
isotropic expansion of the outer ring with a maximum velocity 110km/s. Strong
vertical and non-circular motions are also seen in the vicinity of the inner
ring. Our kinematic data suggest that Arp10 has a small inclination i=22\degr
and high total (luminous plus dark matter) mass of about $10^{12} M_{\odot}$
within a 50 kpc radius.The abundance of oxygen 12 + log(O/H) in both star-
forming rings is about 8.6.The analysis of spectral indices provides an
estimate on the propagation velocities of both rings and metallicity of the
pre-collision stellar population.A small ""knot"" near the nucleus of Arp10,which
was previously suspected as a possible candidate for collision, is now
unambiguously identified as the ""intruder"" of at least 1/4 of the total mass of
Arp~10.We use a simplified two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of galaxy
collisions to test a collisional origin of Arp10. We confirm that the sizes of
the inner and outer rings, maximum expansion velocity of the outer ring, and
radial profile of the gas circular velocity can be reproduced by a near-central
collision with the intruder galaxy, which occurred approximately 85Myr ago. We
acknowledge that an apparent crescent- shaped distribution of H$\alpha$
emission in the outer ring is caused by a star formation threshold in the gas
disk of Arp10.",2007-03-23T00:41:14Z

Landau Cooling in Metal-Semiconductor Nanostructures,"An electron-cooling principle based on Landau quantization is proposed for

PLD. By changing the oxygen activity during deposition we were able to make
SrRuO3 samples that were stoichiometric (low oxygen activity) or with ruthenium
vacancies (high oxygen activity). Samples with strontium vacancies were found
impossible to produce since the ruthenium would precipitate out as RuO2. The
volume of the unit cell of SrRuO3 becomes larger as more ruthenium vacancies
are introduced. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) and room temperature
resistivity were found to systematically depend on the volume of the unit cell
and therefore on the amount of ruthenium vacancies. The RRR varied from ~30 for
stoichiometric samples to less than two for samples that were very ruthenium
poor. The room temperature resistivity varied from 190 microOhm cm for
stoichoimetric samples to over 300 microOhm cm for very ruthenium poor samples.
UPS spectra show a shift of weight from the coherent peak to the incoherent
peak around the Fermi level when samples have more ruthenium vacancies. Core
level XPS spectra of the ruthenium 3d lines show a strong screened part in the
case of stoichiometric samples. This screened part disappears when ruthenium
vacancies are introduced. Both the UPS and the XPS results are consistent with
the view that correlation increases as the amount of ruthenium vacancies
increase.",2007-02-02T18:00:58Z
"Stellar and wind properties of massive stars in the central parsec of
  the Galaxy","We study the stellar and wind properties of massive stars in the central
cluster of the Galaxy. We use non-LTE atmosphere models including winds and
line-blanketing to fit their H and K band spectra obtained with the 3D
spectrograph SINFONI on the VLT. We derive the main stellar (Teff, L,
abundances, ionizing flux) and wind (mass loss rate, terminal velocity)
properties. They are found to be similar to other galactic massive stars. We
show that a direct evolutionary link between Ofpe/WN9, WN8 and WN/C stars
exists. Using individual SEDs for each massive star, we construct the total
spectral energy distribution of the cluster and use it to compute
photoionization models. We show that the nebular properties of the central HII
region are well reproduced. We conclude that, contrary to previous claims,
standard stellar evolution and atmosphere models are well suited to explain the
properties of the central cluster. Our results indicate that massive stars in
the central cluster do not have a peculiar evolution as could be expected from
their proximity to the supermassive black hole SgrA*.",2007-03-09T12:54:43Z
"Macroscopic quantum tunneling and quasiparticle-tunneling blockade
  effect in s-wave/d-wave hybrid junctions","We have theoretically investigated macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) and
the influence of nodal quasiparticles and zero energy bound states (ZES) on MQT
in s-wave/ d-wave hybrid Josephson junctions. In contrast to d-wave/d-wave
junctions, the low-energy quasiparticle dissipation resulting from nodal
quasiparticles and ZES is suppressed due to a quasiparticle-tunneling blockade
effect in an isotropic s-wave superconductor. Therefore, the inherent
dissipation in these junctions is found to be very weak. We have also
investigated MQT in a realistic s-wave/d-wave (Nb/Au/YBCO) junction in which
Ohmic dissipation in a shunt resistance is stronger than the inherent
dissipation and find that MQT is observable within the current experimental
technology. This result suggests high potential of s-wave/d-wave hybrid
junctions for applications in quantum information devices.",2007-02-21T01:11:11Z
Asynchronous Distributed Searchlight Scheduling,"This paper develops and compares two simple asynchronous distributed
searchlight scheduling algorithms for multiple robotic agents in nonconvex
polygonal environments. A searchlight is a ray emitted by an agent which cannot
penetrate the boundary of the environment. A point is detected by a searchlight
if and only if the point is on the ray at some instant. Targets are points
which can move continuously with unbounded speed. The objective of the proposed
algorithms is for the agents to coordinate the slewing (rotation about a point)
of their searchlights in a distributed manner, i.e., using only local sensing
and limited communication, such that any target will necessarily be detected in
finite time. The first algorithm we develop, called the DOWSS (Distributed One
Way Sweep Strategy), is a distributed version of a known algorithm described
originally in 1990 by Sugihara et al \cite{KS-IS-MY:90}, but it can be very
slow in clearing the entire environment because only one searchlight may slew
at a time. In an effort to reduce the time to clear the environment, we develop
a second algorithm, called the PTSS (Parallel Tree Sweep Strategy), in which
searchlights sweep in parallel if guards are placed according to an environment
partition belonging to a class we call PTSS partitions. Finally, we discuss how
DOWSS and PTSS could be combined with with deployment, or extended to
environments with holes.",2007-01-11T20:55:17Z
"Quantum nematic as ground state of a two-dimensional electron gas in a
  magnetic field","We study the ground state of a nematic phase of the two-dimensional electron
gas at filling fraction $\nu = 1/2$ using a variational wavefunction having
Jastrow pair-correlations of the form $\Pi_{i < j}(z_i-z_j)^2$ and an
elliptical Fermi sea. Using the Fermi hypernetted chain approximation we find
that below a critical value of the broken symmetry parameter, the nematic phase
is energetically favorable as compared to the isotropic state for the second
excited Landau level. We also find that below a critical value of the layer
``thickness'' parameter $\lambda$ (and in the actual materials) the quantum
nematic is energetically favorable relative to the stripe ordered Wigner
crystal phase.",2007-02-07T12:51:59Z
On the stress and torque tensors in fluid membranes,"We derive the membrane elastic stress and torque tensors using the standard
Helfrich model and a direct variational method in which the edges of a membrane
are infinitesimally translated and rotated. We give simple expressions of the
stress and torque tensors both in the local tangent frame and in projection
onto a fixed frame. We recover and extend the results of Capovilla and Guven
[J. Phys. A, 2002, \textbf{35}, 6233], which were obtained using covariant
geometry and Noether's theorem: we show that the Gaussian rigidity contributes
to the torque tensor and we include the effect of a surface potential in the
stress tensor. Many interesting situations may be investigated directly using
force and torque balances instead of full energy minimization. As examples, we
consider the force exerted at the end of a membrane tubule, membrane adhesion
and domain contact conditions.",2007-02-12T16:29:06Z
"Exact solution of the mixed-spin Ising model on a decorated square
  lattice with two different kinds of decorating spins on horizontal and
  vertical bonds","The mixed spin-(1/2, S_B, S_C) Ising model on a decorated square lattice with
two different kinds of decorating spins S_B and S_C placed on its horizontal
and vertical bonds, respectively, is exactly solved by establishing a precise
mapping relationship with the corresponding spin-1/2 Ising model on an
anisotropic square (rectangular) lattice. The effect of uniaxial single-ion
anisotropy acting on both types of decorating spins S_B and S_C is examined in
particular. If decorating spins S_B and S_C are integer and half-odd-integer,
respectively, or if the reverse is the case, the model under investigation
displays a very peculiar critical behavior beared on the spontaneously ordered
'quasi-1D' spin system, which appears as a result of the single-ion anisotropy
strengthening. We have found convincing evidence that this remarkable
spontaneous ordering virtually arises even though all integer-valued decorating
spins tend towards their 'non-magnetic' spin state S=0 and the system becomes
disordered only upon further increase of the single-ion anisotropy. The
single-ion anisotropy parameter is also at an origin of various temperature
dependences of the total magnetization when imposing the pure ferrimagnetic or
the mixed ferro-ferrimagnetic character of the spin arrangement.",2007-01-04T08:37:42Z
"Self-Assembly of Patchy Particles into Polymer Chains: A Parameter-Free
  Comparison between Wertheim Theory and Monte Carlo Simulation","We numerically study a simple fluid composed of particles having a hard-core
repulsion, complemented by two short-ranged attractive (sticky) spots at the
particle poles, which provides a simple model for equilibrium polymerization of
linear chains. The simplicity of the model allows for a close comparison, with
no fitting parameters, between simulations and theoretical predictions based on
the Wertheim perturbation theory, a unique framework for the analytic
prediction of the properties of self-assembling particle systems in terms of
molecular parameter and liquid state correlation functions. This theory has not
been subjected to stringent tests against simulation data for ordering across
the polymerization transition. We numerically determine many of the
thermodynamic properties governing this basic form of self-assembly (energy per
particle, order parameter or average fraction of particles in the associated
state, average chain length, chain length distribution, average end-to-end
distance of the chains, and the static structure factor) and find that
predictions of the Wertheim theory accord remarkably well with the simulation
results.",2007-01-22T18:53:24Z
"Revisiting the dynamical exponent equality $z=d$ for the dirty boson
  problem","It is shown that previous arguments leading to the equality $z=d$ ($d$ being
the spatial dimensionality) for the dynamical exponent describing the Bose
glass to superfluid transition may break down, as apparently seen in recent
simulations (Ref. \cite{Baranger}). The key observation is that the major
contribution to the compressibility, which remains finite through the
transition and was predicted to scale as $\kappa \sim |\delta|^{(d-z)\nu}$
(where $\delta$ is the deviation from criticality and $\nu$ is the correlation
length exponent) comes from the analytic part, not the singular part of the
free energy, and therefore is not restricted by any conventional scaling
hypothesis.",2007-03-14T19:19:18Z
"Control of optical emission in doped GaAs/AlGaAs nanofabricated quantum
  dots","Dilute arrays of GaAs/AlGaAs modulation-doped quantum dots (QDs) fabricated
by electron-beam lithography and low impact reactive-ion etching exhibit highly
homogeneous luminescence. Single quantum dots display spectral emission with
peak energies and linewidths linked largely to the geometrical diameter of the
dot and to the built-in electron population. Excitonic-like and
biexcitonic-like emission intensities have activation energy of about 2 meV.
These results highlight the potential of high quality nanofabricated QDs for
applications in areas that require fine control of optical emission.",2007-03-02T13:14:43Z
"The Origin of Ripples in Cool Cores of Galaxy Clusters: Heating by MHD
  Waves?","We consider MHD waves as a heating source of cool cores of galaxy clusters.
In particular, we focus on transverse waves (Alfven waves), because they can
propagate a longer distance than longitudinal waves (sound waves). Using MHD
simulations, we found that the transverse waves can stably heat a cool core if
the wave period is large enough (>~ 10^8 yr). Moreover, the longitudinal waves
that are created as a by-product of the nonlinear evolution of the transverse
waves could be observed as the 'ripples' found in cool cores.",2007-03-02T21:00:32Z
"Selection effects on X-ray and strong-lensing clusters in various
  cosmologies","Galaxy clusters are hotter and more X-ray luminous than in quiescence while
they undergo major mergers, which also transiently increase their
strong-lensing efficiency. We use semi-analytic models for both effects to
study how cluster dynamics in different dark-energy models affects the X-ray
selected cluster population and its strong-lensing optical depth. We find that
mergers increase the number of observable X-ray clusters by factors of a few
and considerably broaden their redshift distribution. Strong-lensing optical
depths are increased by a very similar amount. Quite independent of cosmology,
X-ray bright clusters above a flux limit of $10^{-13.5} \mathrm{erg s^{-1}
cm^{-2}}$ produce $\sim60%$ of the strong-lensing optical depth, and only
$\sim1%$ above a flux limit of $10^{-11.5} \mathrm{erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}}$ if
mergers are taken into account.",2007-03-30T09:34:21Z
Homogeneous cosmologies and the Maupertuis-Jacobi principle,"A recent work showing that homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies involving
scalar fields are equivalent to the geodesics of certain effective manifolds is
generalized to the non-minimally coupled and anisotropic cases. As the
Maupertuis-Jacobi principle in classical mechanics, such result permits us to
infer some dynamical properties of cosmological models from the geometry of the
associated effective manifolds, allowing us to go a step further in the study
of cosmological dynamics. By means of some explicit examples, we show how the
geometrical analysis can simplify considerably the dynamical analysis of
cosmological models.",2007-02-09T21:44:34Z
"Self-bound droplet of Bose and Fermi atoms in one dimension: Collective
  properties in mean-field and Tonks-Girardeau regimes","We investigate a dilute mixture of bosons and spin-polarized fermions in
one-dimension. With an attractive Bose-Fermi scattering length the ground-state
is a self-bound droplet, i.e. a Bose-Fermi bright soliton where the Bose and
Fermi clouds are superimposed. We find that the quantum fluctuations stabilize
the Bose-Fermi soliton such that the one-dimensional bright soliton exists for
any finite attractive Bose-Fermi scattering length. We study density profile
and collective excitations of the atomic bright soliton showing that they
depend on the bosonic regime involved: mean-field or Tonks-Girardeau.",2007-01-30T14:48:38Z
"Vibrational Contribution to Density and Current Autocorrelations in a
  Monatomic Liquid","We consider for a monatomic liquid the density and current autocorrelation
functions from the point of view of the Vibration-Transit (V-T) theory of
liquid dynamics. We also consider their Fourier transforms, one of which is
measured by X-ray and neutron scattering. In this description, the motion of
atoms in the liquid is divided into vibrations in a single characteristic
potential valley, called a random valley, and nearly-instantaneous transitions
called transits between valleys. The theory proposes a Hamiltonian for the
vibrational motion, to be corrected to take transits into account; this
Hamiltonian is used to calculate the autocorrelation functions, giving what we
call their vibrational contributions. We discuss the multimode expansions of
the autocorrelation functions, which provide a physically helpful picture of
the decay of fluctuations in terms of n-mode scattering processes; we also note
that the calculation and Fourier transform of the multimode series are
numerically problematic, as successive terms require larger sums and carry
higher powers of the temperature, which is a concern for the liquid whose
temperature is bounded from below by melt. We suggest that these problems are
avoided by directly computing the autocorrelation functions, for which we
provide straightforward formulas, and Fourier transforming them numerically.",2007-02-02T18:04:45Z
"Luttinger liquids with curvature: Density correlations and Coulomb drag
  effect","We consider the effect of the curvature in fermionic dispersion on the
observable properties of Luttinger liquid (LL). We use the bosonization
technique where the curvature is irrelevant perturbation, describing the decay
of LL bosons (plasmon modes). When possible, we establish the correspondence
between the bosonization and the fermionic approach. We analyze modifications
in density correlation functions due to curvature at finite temperatures, T.
The most important application of our approach is the analysis of the Coulomb
drag by small momentum transfer between two LL, which is only possible due to
curvature. Analyzing the a.c. transconductivity in the one-dimensional drag
setup, we confirm the results by Pustilnik et al. for T-dependence of drag
resistivity, R_{12} ~ T^2 at high and R_{12} ~ T^5 at low temperatures. The
bosonization allows for treating both intra- and inter-wire electron-electron
interactions in all orders, and we calculate exact prefactors in low-T drag
regime. The crossover temperature between the two regimes is T_1 ~ E_F \Delta,
with \Delta relative difference in plasmon velocities. We show that \Delta \neq
0 even for identical wires, due to lifting of degeneracy by interwire
interaction, U_{12}, leading to crossover from R_{12} ~ U_{12}^2 T^2 to R_{12}
\~ T^5/U_{12} at T ~ U_{12}.",2007-02-20T19:53:06Z
"The ZOO of uvby and Hp light curves of magnetic chemically peculiar
  stars","We present preliminary results of the generalized Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) of light curves of 82 magnetic chemically peculiar (further mCP)
stars applied to 54 thousand individual photometric observations in the uvby
and Hp colours taken from the ""On-line database of photometric observations of
mCP stars"". We show that every of the observed light curves (LCs) can be, with
a sufficient accuracy, represented using five parameters of a harmonic
polynomial of the second order, and that the third order and higher harmonics
reflect only a noise. We found that a prevailing majority of the uvbyHp LCs can
be satisfactorily well represented by a linear combination of a constant term
and one or two (extraordinarily three) basic, mutually orthonormal functions,
which reduces the number of parameters necessarily needed to describe the set
of the LCs of a particular star. While the shape of an individual LC depends on
the individual distribution of photometric spots on the surface of a rotating
star, its amplitude depends on the mechanism of variability. To describe the
amplitude of LCs we introduce a robust quantity effective amplitude. Applying
the PCA to the set of the effective amplitudes of the LCs in all five colours
we revealed at least three different sources of the light variability showing
different wavelength dependence. The amplitudes of all the LCs harbor a
component monotonously decreasing with increasing wavelengths. The second
component reaches a remarkable extremum in the $v$ colour, and is in antiphase
relative to the remaining four colours. It occurs particularly at cooler mCP-s
having a high degree of the chemical peculiarity. The third component reflects
a remarkable diversity of the light curves in the $u$ colour found in a few mCP
stars.",2007-03-20T10:51:37Z
"Interference induced metallic-like behavior of a two-dimensional hole
  gas in asymmetric GaAs/In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs quantum well","The temperature and magnetic field dependences of the conductivity of the
heterostructures with asymmetric In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As quantum well are studied.
It is shown that the metallic-like temperature dependence of the conductivity
observed in the structures investigated is quantitatively understandable within
the whole temperature range, $T=0.4-20$ K. It is caused by the interference
quantum correction at fast spin relaxation for 0.4 K$ < T < 1.5$ K. At higher
temperatures, 1.5 K$<T<4$ K, it is due to the interaction quantum correction.
Finally, at $T>4-6$ K, the metallic-like behavior is determined by the phonon
scattering.",2007-02-09T08:07:51Z
A possible activity cycle in Proxima Centauri,"Several late-type stars present activity cycles resembling the Solar one.
This fact has been observed mostly in stars ranging from F to K, i.e., in stars
with a radiative core and an outer convective layer. This work aims at studying
whether an activity cycle can be detected in the dM5.5e star Proxima Centauri,
which is supposed to be completely convective. We present periodical
medium-resolution echelle observations covering the complete visual range,
which were taken at the CASLEO Argentinean Observatory. These observations are
distributed over 7 years. We discarded the spectra that present flare activity,
and analyze the remaining activity levels using four different statistical
techniques to look for a period of activity. We find strong evidence of a
cyclic activity, with a period of around 442 days. We also estimate that the Ca
II S index varies around 130% due to activity variations outside of flares.",2007-03-20T00:09:28Z
Multiquantum well spin oscillator,"A dc voltage biased II-VI semiconductor multiquantum well structure attached
to normal contacts exhibits self-sustained spin-polarized current oscillations
if one or more of its wells are doped with Mn. Without magnetic impurities, the
only configurations appearing in these structures are stationary. Analysis and
numerical solution of a nonlinear spin transport model yield the minimal number
of wells (four) and the ranges of doping density and spin splitting needed to
find oscillations.",2007-02-06T09:12:20Z
Knotted Solitons in a Charged Two-Condensate Bose System,"By making use of the decomposition of U(1) gauge potential theory and the
\phi mapping method, we propose that a charged two-condensate Bose system
possesses vortex lines and two classes of knotted solitons. The topological
charges of the vortex lines are characterized by the Hopf indices and the
Brower degrees of \phi-mapping, and the knotted solitons are described by the
nontrivial Hopf invariant and the BF action, respectively.",2007-03-19T02:39:37Z
HETE-2 Observations of the X-Ray Flash XRF 040916,"A long X-ray flash was detected and localized by the instruments aboard the
High Energy Transient Explorer II (HETE-2) at 00:03:30 UT on 2004 September 16.
The position was reported to the GRB Coordinates Network (GCN) approximately 2
hours after the burst. This burst consists of two peaks separated by 200 s,
with durations of 110 s and 60 s. We have analyzed the energy spectra of the
1st and 2nd peaks observed with the Wide Field X-Ray Monitor (WXM) and the
French Gamma Telescope (FREGATE). We discuss the origin of the 2nd peak in
terms of flux variabilities and timescales. We find that it is most likely part
of the prompt emission, and is explained by the long-acting engine model. This
feature is similar to some bright X-ray flares detected in the early afterglow
phase of bursts observed by the Swift satellite.",2007-03-02T15:14:43Z
Strong Correlations in a nutshell,"We present the phase diagram of clusters made of two, three and four coupled
Anderson impurities. All three clusters share qualitatively similar phase
diagrams that include Kondo screened and unscreened regimes separated by almost
critical crossover regions reflecting the proximity to barely avoided critical
points. This suggests the emergence of universal paradigms that apply to
clusters of arbitrary size. We discuss how these crossover regions of the
impurity models might affect the approach to the Mott transition within a
cluster extension of dynamical mean field theory.",2007-02-27T07:45:36Z
Balls-in-boxes condensation on networks,"We discuss two different regimes of condensate formation in zero-range
processes on networks: on a q-regular network, where the condensate is formed
as a result of a spontaneous symmetry breaking, and on an irregular network,
where the symmetry of the partition function is explicitly broken. In the
latter case we consider a minimal irregularity of the q-regular network
introduced by a single Q-node with degree Q>q. The statics and dynamics of the
condensation depends on the parameter log(Q/q), which controls the exponential
fall-off of the distribution of particles on regular nodes and the typical time
scale for melting of the condensate on the Q-node which increases exponentially
with the system size $N$. This behavior is different than that on a q-regular
network where log(Q/q)=0 and where the condensation results from the
spontaneous symmetry breaking of the partition function, which is invariant
under a permutation of particle occupation numbers on the q-nodes of the
network. In this case the typical time scale for condensate melting is known to
increase typically as a power of the system size.",2007-01-23T14:07:08Z
Certifying controls and systems software,"Software system certification presents itself with many challenges, including
the necessity to certify the system at the level of functional requirements,
code and binary levels, the need to chase down run-time errors, and the need
for proving timing properties of the eventual, compiled system. This paper
illustrates possible approaches for certifying code that arises from control
systems requirements as far as stability properties are concerned. The relative
simplicity of the certification process should encourage the development of
systematic procedures for certifying control system codes for more complex
environments.",2007-01-21T19:34:45Z
The stellar initial mass function of metal-rich populations,"Does the IMF vary? Is it significantly different in metal-rich environments
than in metal-poor ones? Theoretical work predicts this to be the case. But in
order to provide robust empirical evidence for this, the researcher must
understand all possible biases affecting the derivation of the stellar mass
function. Apart from the very difficult observational challenges, this turns
out to be highly non-trivial relying on an exact understanding of how stars
evolve, and how stellar populations in galaxies are assembled dynamically and
how individual star clusters and associations evolve. N-body modelling is
therefore an unavoidable tool in this game: the case can be made that without
complete dynamical modelling of star clusters and associations any statements
about the variation of the IMF with physical conditions are most probably
wrong. The calculations that do exist demonstrate time and again that the IMF
is invariant: There exists no statistically meaningful evidence for a variation
of the IMF from metal-poor to metal-rich populations. This means that currently
existing star-formation theory fails to describe the stellar outcome. Indirect
evidence, based on chemical evolution calculations, however indicate that
extreme star-bursts that assembled bulges and elliptical galaxies may have had
a top-heavy IMF.",2007-03-12T20:00:56Z
Finding Astronomical Communities Through Co-readership Analysis,"Whenever a large group of people are engaged in an activity, communities will
form. The nature of these communities depends on the relationship considered.
In the group of people who regularly use scholarly literature, a relationship
like ``person i and person j have cited the same paper'' might reveal
communities of people working in a particular field. On this poster, we will
investigate the relationship ``person i and person j have read the same
paper''. Using the data logs of the NASA/Smithsonian Astrophysics Data System
(ADS), we first determine the population that will participate by requiring
that a user queries the ADS at a certain rate. Next, we apply the relationship
to this population. The result of this will be an abstract ``relationship
space'', which we will describe in terms of various ``representations''.
Examples of such ``representations'' are the projection of co-read vectors onto
Principal Components and the spectral density of the co-read network. We will
show that the co-read relationship results in structure, we will describe this
structure and we will provide a first attempt in the classification of this
structure in terms of astronomical communities.

Semiclassical and quantum polarons in crystaline acetanilide,"Crystalline acetanilide is a an organic solid with peptide bond structure
similar to that of proteins. Two states appear in the amide I spectral region
having drastically different properties: one is strongly temperature dependent
and disappears at high temperatures while the other is stable at all
temperatures. Experimental and theoretical work over the past twenty five years
has assigned the former to a selftrapped state while the latter to an extended
free exciton state. In this article we review the experimental and theoretical
developments on acetanilide paying particular attention to issues that are
still pending. Although the interpretation of the states is experimentally
sound, we find that specific theoretical comprehension is still lacking. Among
the issues that that appear not well understood is the effective dimensionality
of the selftrapped polaron and free exciton states.",2007-02-27T13:50:22Z
Gas-Liquid Coexistence in the Primitive Model for Water,"We evaluate the location of the gas-liquid coexistence line and of the
associated critical point for the primitive model for water (PMW), introduced
by Kolafa and Nezbeda [J. Kolafa and I. Nezbeda, Mol. Phys. 61, 161 (1987)].
Besides being a simple model for a molecular network forming liquid, the PMW is
representative of patchy proteins and novel colloidal particles interacting
with localized directional short-range attractions. We show that the gas-liquid
phase separation is metastable, i.e. it takes place in the region of the phase
diagram where the crystal phase is thermodynamically favored, as in the case of
articles interacting via short-range attractive spherical potentials.
Differently from spherical potentials, we do not observe crystallization close
to the critical point. The region of gas-liquid instability of this patchy
model is significantly reduced as compared to equivalent models of spherically
interacting particles, confirming the possibility of observing kinetic arrest
in an homogeneous sample driven by bonding as opposed to packing.",2007-03-14T17:50:59Z
"Resonant Rayleigh Scattering in Ordered and Intentionally Disordered
  Semiconductor Superlattices","We report the experimental study of resonant Rayleigh scattering in
GaAs-AlGaAs superlattices with ordered and intentionally disordered potential
profiles (correlated and uncorrelated) in the growth direction z. We show that
the intentional disorder along z modify markedly the energy dispersion of the
dephasing rates of the excitons. The application of an external magnetic field
in the same direction allows the continuous tuning of the in plane exciton
localization and to study the interplay between the in plane and vertical
disorder.",2007-01-25T16:20:18Z
Maximum Weighted Sum Rate of Multi-Antenna Broadcast Channels,"Recently, researchers showed that dirty paper coding (DPC) is the optimal
transmission strategy for multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channels
(MIMO-BC). In this paper, we study how to determine the maximum weighted sum of
DPC rates through solving the maximum weighted sum rate problem of the dual
MIMO multiple access channel (MIMO-MAC) with a sum power constraint. We first
simplify the maximum weighted sum rate problem such that enumerating all
possible decoding orders in the dual MIMO-MAC is unnecessary. We then design an
efficient algorithm based on conjugate gradient projection (CGP) to solve the
maximum weighted sum rate problem. Our proposed CGP method utilizes the
powerful concept of Hessian conjugacy. We also develop a rigorous algorithm to
solve the projection problem. We show that CGP enjoys provable convergence,
nice scalability, and great efficiency for large MIMO-BC systems.",2007-03-22T17:20:02Z
"A decision procedure for linear ""big O"" equations","Let $F$ be the set of functions from an infinite set, $S$, to an ordered
ring, $R$. For $f$, $g$, and $h$ in $F$, the assertion $f = g + O(h)$ means
that for some constant $C$, $|f(x) - g(x)| \leq C |h(x)|$ for every $x$ in $S$.
Let $L$ be the first-order language with variables ranging over such functions,
symbols for $0, +, -, \min, \max$, and absolute value, and a ternary relation
$f = g + O(h)$. We show that the set of quantifier-free formulas in this
language that are valid in the intended class of interpretations is decidable,
and does not depend on the underlying set, $S$, or the ordered ring, $R$. If
$R$ is a subfield of the real numbers, we can add a constant 1 function, as
well as multiplication by constants from any computable subfield. We obtain
further decidability results for certain situations in which one adds symbols
denoting the elements of a fixed sequence of functions of strictly increasing
rates of growth.",2007-01-10T19:46:21Z
Chiral Gauge Theory for Graphene,"We construct a chiral gauge theory to describe fractionalization of fermions

"Coupling between radial and torsional oscillations in a magnetized
  plasma and possible stellar applications","The weakly non-linear interaction of slow magnetoacoustic and torsional
Alfven waves propagating along an unperturbed poloidal magnetic field in a
stellar interior is studied in the high plasma beta limit. It is shown that
slow magnetoacoustic waves parametrically drive torsional modes with the half
frequency and wave number. Therefore global slow magnetoacoustic waves which
have a radial velocity polarization, may amplify the torsional oscillations.
Possible applications of this mechanism to the Sun and binary stars are briefly
discussed.",2007-03-09T10:04:30Z

  polymers in water","We present results from extensive molecular dynamics simulations of collapse
transitions of hydrophobic polymers in explicit water focused on understanding
effects of lengthscale of the hydrophobic surface and of attractive
interactions on folding. Hydrophobic polymers display parabolic, protein-like,
temperature-dependent free energy of unfolding. Folded states of small
attractive polymers are marginally stable at 300 K, and can be unfolded by
heating or cooling. Increasing the lengthscale or decreasing the polymer-water
attractions stabilizes folded states significantly, the former dominated by the
hydration contribution. That hydration contribution can be described by the
surface tension model, $\Delta G=\gamma (T)\Delta A$, where the surface
tension, $\gamma$, is lengthscale dependent and decreases monotonically with
temperature. The resulting variation of the hydration entropy with polymer
lengthscale is consistent with theoretical predictions of Huang and Chandler
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,97, 8324-8327, 2000) that explain the blurring of
entropy convergence observed in protein folding thermodynamics. Analysis of
water structure shows that the polymer-water hydrophobic interface is soft and
weakly dewetted, and is characterized by enhanced interfacial density
fluctuations. Formation of this interface, which induces polymer folding, is
strongly opposed by enthalpy and favored by entropy, similar to the
vapor-liquid interface.",2007-01-26T23:47:53Z
"Statistical mechanics of coil-hairpin transition in a single stranded
  DNA oligomer","A model of self-avoiding walk with suitable constraints on self-attraction is
developed to describe the conformational behavior of a short RNA or a single
stranded DNA molecule that forms hairpin structure and calculate the properties
associated with coil-hairpin transition by enumerating all possible
conformations of a chain of N monomers in two and three dimensions. The first
and last five monomers of the chain have been allowed to pair and form the stem
of the hairpin structure while the remaining monomers can form a loop. The
coil-hairpin transition is found to be first order with large entropy change.
While the rate of unzipping of the hairpin stem is found to be independent of
the length of the loop and the dimensionality of the space, the rate of closing
varies greatly with loop length and dimensionality of the space.",2007-01-16T09:58:57Z
Thomas-Fermi Screening in Graphene,"The in-plane static screening of the field originated by a charge placed in a
graphene sheet is investigated. A self-consistent field equation in the real
space domain is obtained by using a suitable Thomas-Fermi procedure. Exact and
approximated (for qualitative considerations) solutions are presented. In the
case of a charged sheet, the screened potential presents a tail dependent on
the free carrier density whose importance is connected with the local features
of the impurity system. Early conclusions about Thomas-Fermi screening in
graphene are revised.",2007-01-05T13:56:57Z
On the nature of the phase transition in the itinerant helimagnet MnSi,"A careful study of thermodynamic and transport properties of a high quality
single crystal of MnSi at ambient pressure suggests that its transition to a
helical magnetic state near 29 K is weakly first order. The heat capacity,
temperature derivatives of resistivity, thermal expansion and magnetic
susceptibility exhibit a specific structure around the phase transition point,
interpreted as a combination of first and second order features. Conclusions
drawn from these experiments question prevailing views on the phase diagram of
MnSi and propose that the phase transition under study becomes second order at
high pressure and low temperature.",2007-02-20T13:41:42Z
Gauge Field Formulation of Adiabatic Spin Torques,"Previous calculation of spin torques for small-amplitude magnetization
dynamics around a uniformly magnetized state [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 75}
(2006) 113706] is extended here to the case of finite-amplitude dynamics. This
is achieved by introducing an `` adiabatic'' spin frame for conduction
electrons, and the associated SU(2) gauge field. In particular, the Gilbert
damping is shown to arise from the time variation of the spin-relaxation source
terms in this new frame, giving a new physical picture of the damping. The
present method will allow a `` first-principle'' derivation of spin torques
without any assumptions such as rotational symmetry in spin space.",2007-03-27T10:03:01Z
"Lamellar order, microphase structures and glassy phase in a field
  theoretic model for charged colloids","In this paper we present a detailed analytical study of the phase diagram and
of the structural properties of a field theoretic model with a short-range
attraction and a competing long-range screened repulsion. We provide a full
derivation and expanded discussion and digression on results previously
reported briefly in M. Tarzia and A. Coniglio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 075702
(2006). The model contains the essential features of the effective interaction
potential among charged colloids in polymeric solutions. We employ the
self-consistent Hartree approximation and a replica approach, and we show that
varying the parameters of the repulsive potential and the temperature yields a
phase coexistence, a lamellar and a glassy phase. Our results suggest that the
cluster phase observed in charged colloids might be the signature of an
underlying equilibrium lamellar phase, hidden on experimental time scales, and
emphasize that the formation of microphase structures may play a prominent role
in the process of colloidal gelation.",2007-01-23T17:57:07Z
Diffusion wave modes and oscillating motions in superfluid $He^3-A$,"Diffusion vibrational modes are studied in superfluid $He^3-A$ in zero
magnetic fields for different angles between the orbital axis and the wave
vector. The dispersion relation for these modes is found to depend on the wave
polarization. It is shown that in addition to the normal component velocity,
the superfluid component velocity also oscillates in the diffusion modes of
$He^3-A$. The frictional forces due to viscous waves in $He^3-A$, exerted in
the plane surface which is in contact with a superfluid liquid layer of finite
thickness and performs a simple harmonic oscillatory motion, are calculated. We
also consider, volume of $He^3-A$ restricted by two parallel infinite surfaces,
when the lower surface accomplishes simple harmonic oscillation and we
calculate the frictional forces exerted on surfaces. It is found that the
frictional force has not only parallel, but also a perpendicular component
relative to the direction of oscillations.",2007-02-08T13:13:13Z
"Explorations of the r-Processes: Comparisons between Calculations and
  Observations of Low-Metallicity Stars","Abundances of heavier elements (barium and beyond) in many
neutron-capture-element-rich halo stars accurately replicate the solar system
r-process pattern. However, abundances of lighter neutron-capture elements in
these stars are not consistent with the solar system pattern. These comparisons
suggest contributions from two distinct types of r-process synthesis events --
a so called main r-process for the elements above the 2nd r-process peak and a
weak r-process for the lighter neutron-capture elements. We have performed
r-process theoretical predictions to further explore the implications of the
solar and stellar observations. We find that the isotopic composition of barium
and the elemental Ba/Eu abundance ratios in r-process-rich low metallicity
stars can only be matched by computations in which the neutron densities are in
the range 23< log n_n < 28, values typical of the main r-process. For r-process
conditions that successfully generate the heavy element pattern extending down
to A=135, the relative abundance of I129 produced in this mass region appears
to be at least 90% of the observed solar value. Finally, in the neutron number
density ranges required for production of the observed solar/stellar 3rd
r-process-peak (A~200), the predicted abundances of inter-peak element hafnium
(Z=72, A~180) follow closely those of 3rd-peak elements and lead. Hf,
observable from the ground and close in mass number to the 3rd r-process-peak
elements, might also be utilized as part of a new nuclear chronometer pair,
Th/Hf, for stellar age determinations.",2007-03-05T21:26:30Z
Bright solitons and soliton trains in a fermion-fermion mixture,"We use a time-dependent dynamical mean-field-hydrodynamic model to predict
and study bright solitons in a degenerate fermion-fermion mixture in a
quasi-one-dimensional cigar-shaped geometry using variational and numerical
methods. Due to a strong Pauli-blocking repulsion among identical
spin-polarized fermions at short distances there cannot be bright solitons for
repulsive interspecies fermion-fermion interactions. However, stable bright
solitons can be formed for a sufficiently attractive interspecies interaction.
We perform a numerical stability analysis of these solitons and also
demonstrate the formation of soliton trains. These fermionic solitons can be
formed and studied in laboratory with present technology.",2007-02-07T14:29:07Z
Application of Thomas-Fermi model to fullerene molecule and nanotube,"Semiclassical description, based on electrostatics and Thomas-Fermi model is
applied here to calculate dimensions of the electronic shell of a fullerene
molecule and a nanotube. The internal radius of the electronic shell of a
fullerene molecule, calculated within the framework of the model is 0.2808 nm.
The external radius is 0.4182 nm. The experimental values are 0.279 nm and
0.429 nm correspondingly. This shows that semiclassical approach provides
rather good description of the dimensions of the electronic shell in a
fullerene molecule. Two types of dipole oscillations in a fullerene molecule
are considered and their frequencies are calculated. Similar calculations are
performed for a nanotube also. For a nanotube with a radius of the cylinder of
the ions, Rn = 0.7 nm, the internal radius of the electronic shell, calculated
within the framework of the model is 0.577 nm. The external radius is 0.816 nm.
Three types of dipole oscillations in nanotube are considered and their
frequencies are calculated.",2007-02-04T10:28:57Z
"Transport Properties of Multiple Quantum Dots Arranged in Parallel:
  Results from the Bethe Ansatz","In this paper we analyze transport through a double dot system connected to
two external leads. Imagining each dot possessing a single active level, we
model the system through a generalization of the Anderson model. We argue that
this model is exactly solvable when certain constraints are placed upon the dot
Coulomb charging energy, the dot-lead hybridization, and the value of the
applied gate voltage. Using this exact solvability, we access the zero
temperature linear response conductance both in and out of the presence of a
Zeeman field. We are also able to study the finite temperature linear response
conductance. We focus on universal behaviour and identify three primary
features in the transport of the dots: i) a so-called RKKY Kondo effect; ii) a
standard Kondo effect; and iii) interference phenomena leading to sharp
variations in the conductance including conductance zeros. We are able to use
the exact solvability of the dot model to characterize these phenomena
quantitatively. While here we primarily consider a double dot system, the
approach adopted applies equally well to N-dot systems.",2007-01-26T20:23:18Z
Magnetic field dependence of charge stripe order in La2-xBaxCuO4 (x~1/8),"We have carried out a detailed investigation of the magnetic field dependence
of charge ordering in La2-xBaxCuO4 (x~1/8) utilizing high-resolution x-ray
scattering. We find that the charge order correlation length increases as the
magnetic field greater than ~5T is applied in the superconducting phase (T=2K).
The observed unusual field dependence of the charge order correlation length
suggests that the static charge stripe order competes with the superconducting
ground state in this sample.",2007-03-10T19:04:16Z
Zero modes and the edge states of the honeycomb lattice,"The honeycomb lattice in the cylinder geometry with zigzag edges, bearded
edges, zigzag and bearded edges (zigzag-bearded), and armchair edges are
studied. The tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hoppings is used. Edge
states are obtained analytically for these edges except the armchair edges. It
is shown, however, that edge states for the armchair edges exist when the the
system is anisotropic. These states have not been known previously. We also
find strictly localized states, uniformly extended states and states with
macroscopic degeneracy.",2007-02-07T02:34:26Z
"Conformation dependence of molecular conductance: chemistry versus
  geometry","Recent experiments by Venkatamaran {\em et al.} [Nature (London) {\bf 442},
904 (2006)] on a series of molecular wires with varying chemical compositions,
revealed a linear dependence of the conductance on $\mathrm{cos}^2\theta$,
where $\theta$ is the angle of twist between neighboring aromatic rings. To
investigate whether or not this dependence has a more general applicability, we
present a first principles theoretical study of the transport properties of
this family of molecules as a function of the chemical composition,
conformation and the contact atom and geometry. If the Fermi energy
$E_\mathrm{F}$ lies within the HOMO-LUMO gap, then we reproduce the above
experimental results. More generally, however, if $E_\mathrm{F}$ is located
within either the LUMO or HOMO states, the presence of resonances destroys the
linear dependence of the conductance on $\mathrm{cos}^2\theta$ and gives rise
to non-monotonic behaviour associated with the level structure of the different
molecules. Our results suggest that the above experiments provide a novel
method for extracting spectroscopic information about molecules contacted to
electrodes.",2007-03-05T18:34:14Z
Dynamics of ultrathin metal films on amorphous substrates,"A mathematical model is developed to analyze the growth/decay rate of surface
perturbations of an ultrathin metal film on an amorphous substrate (SiO_{2}).
The formulation combines the approach of Mullins [J. Appl. Phys. v30, 77, 1959]
for bulk substrates, in which curvature-driven mass transport and surface
deformation can occur by surface/volume diffusion and evaporation-condensation
processes, with that of Spencer et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. v67, 26, 1991] to
describe solid state transport in thin films under epitaxial strain. The model
is applied to study the relative rate of solid state mass transport as compared
to that of liquid phase dewetting in a thin film subjected to fast a thermal
pulse. Specifically, we have recently shown that multiple cycles of nanosecond
(ns) pulsed laser melting and resolidification of ultrathin metal films on
amorphous substrates can lead to the formation of various types of spatially
ordered nanostructures [Phys. Rev. B, v75, 235439 (2007)]. The pattern
formation has been attributed to the dewetting of the thin film by a
hydrodynamic instability. In such experiments the film is in the solid state
during a substantial fraction of each thermal cycle. Results of a linear
stability analysis based on the aforementioned model suggest that solid state
mass transport has negligible effect on morphology changes of the surface.
Hence, surface deformation caused by liquid phase instabilities is rapidly
quenched-in during the cooling phase. This deformed state is further evolved by
subsequent laser pulses. These results have implications to developing accurate
computer simulations of thin film dewetting by energetic beams aimed at the
manufacturing of optically active nanoscale materials for applications
including information processing, optical devices and solar energy harvesting.",2007-03-01T07:54:05Z
"Quantum Metamagnetic Transitions Induced by Changes in Fermi-Surface
  Topology -Applications to a Weak Itinerant-Electron Ferromagnet;ZrZn_2","We clarify that metamagnetic transitions in three dimensions show unusual
properties as quantum phase transitions if they are accompanied by changes in
Fermi-surface topology. An unconventional universality deeply affected by the
topological nature of Lifshitz-type transitions emerges around the marginal
quantum critical point (MQCP). Here the MQCP is defined by the meeting point of
the finite temperature critical line and a quantum critical line running on the
zero temperature plane. The MQCP offers a marked contrast with the Ising
universality and the gas-liquid-type criticality satisfied for conventional
metamagnetic transitions. At the MQCP, the inverse magnetic susceptibility
chi^-1 has diverging slope as a function of the magnetization m (namely, | d
chi^-1/d m | -> infty) in one side of the transition, which should not occur in
any conventional quantum critical phenomena. The exponent of the divergence can
be estimated even at finite temperatures. We propose that such an
unconventional universality indeed accounts for the metamagnetic transition in
ZrZn_2.",2007-03-16T14:25:19Z
Water on Pt(111): the importance of proton disorder,"The structure of a water adlayer on Pt(111) surface is investigated by
extensive first principle calculations. Only allowing for proton disorder the
ground state energy can be found. This results from an interplay between
water/metal chemical bonding and the hydrogen bonding of the water network. The
resulting short O-Pt distance accounts for experimental evidences. The novelty
of these results shed a new light on relevant aspects of water-metal
interaction.",2007-01-23T11:47:22Z
The maximum relative entropy principle,"We show that the naive application of the maximum entropy principle can yield
answers which depend on the level of description, i.e. the result is not
invariant under coarse-graining. We demonstrate that the correct approach, even
for discrete systems, requires maximization of the relative entropy with a
suitable reference probability, which in some instances can be deduced from the
symmetry properties of the dynamics. We present simple illustrations of this
crucial yet surprising feature in examples of classical and quantum statistical
mechanics, as well as in the field of ecology.",2007-03-23T15:09:51Z
Sidebands in the light absorption of driven metallic nanoparticles,"The dynamics of the surface plasmon in laser-driven metallic nanoparticles is
described by means of a master-equation formalism. Within the Markov
approximation, the dynamics is studied for different regimes ranging from weak
excitation in photoabsorption experiments to strong excitation in pump-probe
spectroscopy. It is shown that two collective levels are sufficient to describe
the dynamics of the surface plasmon. On this basis, we predict the appearance
of sidebands in the absorption spectrum of the probe laser field in pump-probe
experiments.",2007-03-27T16:15:08Z
Cu $K$-edge Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering in Edge-Sharing Cuprates,"We present calculations for resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in
edge-shared copper oxide systems, such as CuGeO$_{3}$ and Li$_{2}$CuO$_{2}$,
appropriate for hard x-ray scattering where the photoexcited electron lies
above oxygen 2p and copper 3d orbital energies. We perform exact
diagonalizations of the multi-band Hubbard and determine the energies, orbital
character and resonance profiles of excitations which can be probed via RIXS.
We find excellent agreement with recent results on Li$_{2}$CuO$_{2}$ and
CuGeO$_{3}$ in the 2-7 eV photon energy loss range.",2007-02-01T19:51:08Z
Magnetic structure of Cd-doped CeCoIn5,"The heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 is believed to be close to a
magnetic instability, but no static magnetic order has been found. Cadmium
doping on the In-site shifts the balance between superconductivity and
antiferromagnetism to the latter with an extended concentration range where
both types of order coexist at low temperatures. We investigated the magnetic
structure of nominally 10% Cd-doped CeCoIn5, being antiferromagnetically
ordered below T_N=3 K and superconducting below T_c=1.3 K, by elastic neutron
scattering. Magnetic intensity was observed only at the ordering wave vector
Q_AF = (1/2,1/2,1/2) commensurate with the crystal lattice. Upon entering the
superconducting state the magnetic intensity seems to change only little. The
commensurate magnetic ordering in CeCo(In1-xCdx)5 is in contrast to the
incommensurate antiferromagnetic ordering observed in the closely related
compound CeRhIn5. Our results give new insights in the interplay between
superconductivity and magnetism in the family of CeTIn5 (T=Co, Rh, and Ir)
based compounds.",2007-03-27T09:22:11Z
Phase diagram for interacting Bose gases,"We propose a new form of the inversion method in terms of a selfenergy
expansion to access the phase diagram of the Bose-Einstein transition. The
dependence of the critical temperature on the interaction parameter is
calculated. This is discussed with the help of a new condition for
Bose-Einstein condensation in interacting systems which follows from the pole
of the T-matrix in the same way as from the divergence of the medium-dependent
scattering length. A many-body approximation consisting of screened ladder
diagrams is proposed which describes the Monte Carlo data more appropriately.
The specific results are that a non-selfconsistent T-matrix leads to a linear
coefficient in leading order of 4.7, the screened ladder approximation to 2.3,
and the selfconsistent T-matrix due to the effective mass to a coefficient of
1.3 close to the Monte Carlo data.",2007-01-12T15:21:48Z
"Equation of state of cubic boron nitride at high pressures and
  temperatures","We report accurate measurements of the equation of state (EOS) of cubic boron
nitride by x-ray diffraction up to 160 GPa at 295 K and 80 GPa in the range
500-900 K. Experiments were performed on single-crystals embedded in a
quasi-hydrostatic pressure medium (helium or neon). Comparison between the
present EOS data at 295 K and literature allows us to critically review the
recent calibrations of the ruby standard. The full P-V-T data set can be
represented by a Mie-Gr\""{u}neisen model, which enables us to extract all
relevant thermodynamic parameters: bulk modulus and its first
pressure-derivative, thermal expansion coefficient, thermal Gr\""{u}neisen
parameter and its volume dependence. This equation of state is used to
determine the isothermal Gr\""{u}neisen mode parameter of the Raman TO band. A
new formulation of the pressure scale based on this Raman mode, using
physically-constrained parameters, is deduced.",2007-02-27T19:25:44Z
Self sustained traversable wormholes and the equation of state,"We compute the graviton one loop contribution to a classical energy in a
\textit{traversable} wormhole background. The form of the shape function
considered is obtained by the equation of state $p=\omega\rho$. We investigate
the size of the wormhole as a function of the parameter $\omega$. The
investigation is evaluated by means of a variational approach with Gaussian
trial wave functionals. A zeta function regularization is involved to handle
with divergences. A renormalization procedure is introduced and the finite one
loop energy is considered as a \textit{self-consistent} source for the
traversable wormhole.The case of the phantom region is briefly discussed.",2007-01-02T15:30:47Z
Polyfluorene as a model system for space-charge-limited conduction,"Ethyl-hexyl substituted polyfluorene (PF) with its high level of molecular
disorder can be described very well by one-carrier space-charge-limited
conduction for a discrete set of trap levels with energy $\sim$ 0.5 eV above
the valence band edge. Sweeping the bias above the trap-filling limit in the
as-is polymer generates a new set of exponential traps, which is clearly seen
in the density of states calculations. The trapped charges in the new set of
traps have very long lifetimes and can be detrapped by photoexcitation. Thermal
cycling the PF film to a crystalline phase prevents creation of additional
traps at higher voltages.",2007-03-21T19:16:56Z
"Occultation measurement of the size of the X-ray emitting region in the
  Active Galactic Nucleus of NGC 1365","We present an occultation of the central X-ray emitting region in the Seyfert
Galaxy NGC 1365. This extreme spectral variation (from Compton-thin to
reflection-dominated and back to Compton-thin in four days) has been caught in
a ten days Chandra monitoring campaign consisting of six short (15 ks)
observations performed every two days. We discuss the implications of this
occultation within the scenario of a Compton-thick cloud crossing the line of
sight of the X-ray source. We estimate a source size R<10^14 cm and a distance
of the cloud from the source D<10^16 cm. This direct measurement confirms the
theoretical expectations of an extremely compact X-ray source, and shows that
the Compton-thick circumnuclear gas is located at a distance from the center on
the scale of the Broad Line Region.",2007-03-08T09:43:50Z
Proper Motion Studies of Outflows from Classical T Tauri Stars,"In a previous paper (McGroarty & Ray 2004, 420, 975) we examined the
environment of a number of evolved low-mass young stars, i.e. Classical T Tauri
Stars, to see if they are capable of driving parsec-scale outflows. These stars
- CW Tau, DG Tau, DO Tau, HV Tau C and RW Aur - were previously known to drive
only ""micro-jets"" or small-scale outflows of < 1' or 0.04 pc at the distance of
the Taurus-Auriga Cloud. We found that they drive outflows of 0.5pc - 1pc,
based on the morphology and alignment of newly discovered and previously known
HH objects with these sources and their ""micro-jets"". Here, we use a
cross-correlation method to determine the proper motions of the HH objects in
these five outflows (HH 220, HH 229, HH 702, HH 705 and HH 826 - HH 835) which
in turn allows us to confirm their driving sources. Moreover, the tangential
velocities of HH objects at large distances from their origin are currently
poorly known so these proper motions will allow us to determine how velocities
evolve with distance from their source. We find tangential velocities of
typically 200 kms^-1 for the more distant objects in these outflows.
Surprisingly, we find similar tangential velocities for the ""micro-jets"" that
are currently being ejected from these sources. This leads us to suggest that
either the outflow velocity was much higher 10^3 years ago when the more
distant objects were ejected and that these objects have decelerated to their
current velocity or that the outflow velocity at the source has remained
approximately constant and the more distant objects have not undergone
significant deceleration due to interactions with the ambient medium. Numerical
simulations are needed before we can decide between these scenarios.",2007-03-15T18:22:23Z
The Haar Wavelet Transform of a Dendrogram: Additional Notes,"We consider the wavelet transform of a finite, rooted, node-ranked, $p$-way

through translation and dilation of a wavelet function. We explore how this
works in our tree context.",2007-02-10T21:26:05Z
"Transition from a two-dimensional superfluid to a one-dimensional Mott
  insulator","A two-dimensional system of atoms in an anisotropic optical lattice is
studied theoretically. If the system is finite in one direction, it is shown to
exhibit a transition between a two-dimensional superfluid and a one-dimensional
Mott insulating chain of superfluid tubes. Monte Carlo simulations are
consistent with the expectation that the phase transition is of
Kosterlitz-Thouless type. The effect of the transition on experimental
time-of-flight images is discussed.",2007-01-25T14:29:28Z
Efficient current-induced domain-wall displacement SrRuO3,"We demonstrate current-induced displacement of ferromagnetic domain walls in
sub-micrometer fabricated patterns of SrRuO3 films. The displacement, monitored
by measuring the extraordinary Hall effect, is induced at zero applied magnetic
field and its direction is reversed when the current is reversed. We find that
current density in the range of 10^9 - 10^10 A/m^2 is sufficient for
domain-wall displacement when the depinning field varies between 50 to 500 Oe.
These results indicate relatively high efficiency of the current in displacing
domain walls which we believe is related to the narrow width ~3 nm of domain
walls in this compound.",2007-03-19T12:35:39Z
"Fokker-Planck and Chapman-Kolmogorov equations for Ito processes with
  finite memory","The usual derivation of the Fokker-Planck partial differential eqn. assumes
the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for a Markov process. Starting instead with an
Ito stochastic differential equation we argue that finitely many states of
memory are allowed in Kolmogorov's two pdes, K1 (the backward time pde) and K2
(the Fokker-Planck pde), and show that a Chapman-Kolmogorov eqn. follows as
well. We adapt Friedman's derivation to emphasize that finite memory is not
excluded. We then give an example of a Gaussian transition density with 1 state
memory satisfying both K1, K2, and the Chapman-Kolmogorov eqns. We begin the
paper by explaining the meaning of backward diffusion, and end by using our
interpretation to produce a new, short proof that the Green function for the
Black-Scholes pde describes a Martingale in the risk neutral discounted stock
price.",2007-02-22T09:00:56Z
"Reference levels, signal forms and determination of emission factor in
  DLTS","The existence of reference levels of signals which determine directly the
temperature dependence of emission factor in deep level transient phenomena is
discussed. The basic algebraic structure of reference levels in the classical

given. We then demonstrate the use of these signal forms and compare them with
the classical DLTS double boxcar signal.",2007-01-27T01:56:10Z
The Stackelberg Minimum Spanning Tree Game,"We consider a one-round two-player network pricing game, the Stackelberg
Minimum Spanning Tree game or StackMST.
  The game is played on a graph (representing a network), whose edges are
colored either red or blue, and where the red edges have a given fixed cost
(representing the competitor's prices). The first player chooses an assignment
of prices to the blue edges, and the second player then buys the cheapest
possible minimum spanning tree, using any combination of red and blue edges.
The goal of the first player is to maximize the total price of purchased blue
edges. This game is the minimum spanning tree analog of the well-studied
Stackelberg shortest-path game.
  We analyze the complexity and approximability of the first player's best
strategy in StackMST. In particular, we prove that the problem is APX-hard even
if there are only two different red costs, and give an approximation algorithm
whose approximation ratio is at most $\min \{k,1+\ln b,1+\ln W\}$, where $k$ is
the number of distinct red costs, $b$ is the number of blue edges, and $W$ is
the maximum ratio between red costs. We also give a natural integer linear
programming formulation of the problem, and show that the integrality gap of
the fractional relaxation asymptotically matches the approximation guarantee of
our algorithm.",2007-03-05T09:46:26Z
"AST/RO 13CO(J=2-1) and 12CO(J=4-3) Mapping of Southern Spitzer c2d Small
  Clouds and Cores","Forty molecular cloud cores in the southern hemisphere from the initial
Spitzer Space Telescope Cores-to-Disks (c2d) Legacy program source list have
been surveyed in 13CO(2-1), 12CO(4-3), and 12CO(7-6) with the Antarctic
Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory (AST/RO). The cores, ten of
which contain embedded sources, are located mostly in the Vela, Ophiuchus,
Lupus, Chamaeleon, Musca, and Scorpius complexes. 12CO(7-6) emission was
undetected in all 40 clouds. We present data of 40 sources in 13CO(2-1) and
12CO(4-3), significant upper limits of 12CO(7-6), as well as a statistical
analysis of the observed properties of the clouds. We find the typical
13CO(2-1) linewidth to be 2.0 km/s for cores with embedded stars, and 1.8 km/s
for all others. The typical 12CO(4-3) linewidth is 2.6 to 3.7 km/s for cores
with known embedded sources, and 1.6 to 2.3 km/s for all others. The average
13CO column density derived from the line intensities was found to be 1.9 x
10^15 cm^(-2) for cores with embedded stars, and 1.5 x 10^15 cm^(-2) for all
others. The average kinetic temperature in the molecular cores, determined
through a Large Velocity Gradient analysis of a set of nine cores, has an
average lower limit of 16 K and an average upper limit of 26 K. The average
molecular hydrogen density has an average lower limit of 10^2.9 cm^(-3) and an
average upper limit of 10^3.3 cm^(-3) for all cores. For a different subset of
nine cores, we have derived masses. They range from 4 to 255 M_sun. Overall,
our c2d sample of southern molecular cores has a range of properties
(linewidth, column density, size, mass, embedded stars) similar to those of
past studies.",2007-03-05T23:07:59Z
The rise of graphene,"Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and
condensed matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits
exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality and, despite its short
history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential
applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of
the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no
longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental
physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the
emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed matter physics, where
quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high energy
physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More
generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are
only one atom thick and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional
physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile
ground for applications.",2007-02-26T12:18:29Z
"Pressure induced phase transitions in PbTiO$_3$ - a query for the
  polarization rotation theory","Our first-principles computations show that the ground state of PbTiO$_3$
under hydrostatic pressure transforms discontinuously from $P4mm$ to $R3c$ at 9
GPa. Spontaneous polarization decreases with increasing pressure so that the
$R3c$ phase transforms to the centrosymmetric $R\bar{3}c$ phase at around 30
GPa. The first-order phase transition between tetragonal and rhombohedral phase
is exceptional since there is no evidence for a bridging phase. The essential
feature of the $R3c$ and $R\bar{3}c$ phases is that they allow the oxygen
octahedron to increase its volume $V_B$ at the expense of cuboctahedral volume
$V_A$ around a Pb ion. This is further supported by the fact that neither the
$R3m$ nor $Cm$ phase, which keep the $V_A/V_B$ ratio constant, is a ground
state within the pressure range between 0 and 40 GPa. Thus tetragonal strain is
dominant up to 9 GPa, whereas at higher pressures efficient compression through
oxygen octahedra tilting plays the central role for PbTiO$_3$. Previously
predicted pressure induced colossal enhancement of piezoelectricity in
PbTiO$_3$ corresponds to unstable $Cm$ and $R3m$ phases. This suggests that the
phase instability, in contrast to the polarization rotation, is responsible for
the large piezoelectric properties observed in systems like Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$ in
the vicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary.",2007-02-16T13:48:30Z
"Morphology of anisotropic chains in a magneto-rheological fluid during
  aggregation and disaggregation processes","We study the morphology of the chain-like aggregates formed when a external
constant and uniaxial magnetic field is applied to a magneto-rheological (MR)
fluid. In order to characterize the conformation of the aggregates, we study
the evolution of various fractal dimensions during aggregation and
disaggregation processes (i.e., when the applied field is switched on and off),
using video-microscopy and image analysis. Experiments have been performed by
varying the values of two external parameters: the magnetic field amplitude and
particle concentration. We found that the box-counting dimension, related with
how the aggregates occupy the surrounding space, depends on the ratio
$R_1/R_0$. During the first stage of the disaggregation process, when the
particles are moving by Brownian motion inside the aggregate, Family-Vicsek
scaling function is verified.",2007-01-11T11:58:09Z
"The short-range three-body phase and other issues impacting the
  observation of Efimov physics in ultracold quantum gases","We discuss several issues important for experimentally observing Efimov
physics in ultracold quantum gases. By numerically solving the three-boson
Schr\""odinger equation over a broad range of scattering lengths and energies,
and by including model potentials with multiple bound states, we address the
complications of relating experimental observations to available analytic
expressions. These more realistic potentials introduce features that can mask
the predicted Efimov physics at small scattering lengths. They also allow us to
verify that positive and negative scattering lengths are universally connected
only across a pole, not across a zero. Additionally, we show that the spacing
between Efimov features for the relatively small scattering lengths accessible
experimentally fail to precisely follow the geometric progression expected for
Efimov physics. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the short-range
three-body physics in determining the position of Efimov features and show that
theoretically reproducing two-body physics is not generally sufficient to
predict three-body properties quantitatively.",2007-03-11T01:25:25Z
Vertex corrections in localized and extended systems,"Within many-body perturbation theory we apply vertex corrections to various
closed-shell atoms and to jellium, using a local approximation for the vertex
consistent with starting the many-body perturbation theory from a DFT-LDA
Green's function. The vertex appears in two places -- in the screened Coulomb
interaction, W, and in the self-energy, \Sigma -- and we obtain a systematic
discrimination of these two effects by turning the vertex in \Sigma on and off.
We also make comparisons to standard GW results within the usual random-phase
approximation (RPA), which omits the vertex from both. When a vertex is
included for closed-shell atoms, both ground-state and excited-state properties
demonstrate only limited improvements over standard GW. For jellium we observe
marked improvement in the quasiparticle band width when the vertex is included
only in W, whereas turning on the vertex in \Sigma leads to an unphysical
quasiparticle dispersion and work function. A simple analysis suggests why
implementation of the vertex only in W is a valid way to improve quasiparticle
energy calculations, while the vertex in \Sigma is unphysical, and points the
way to development of improved vertices for ab initio electronic structure
calculations.",2007-02-13T10:25:36Z
Contrasting copper evolution in Omega Centauri and the Milky Way,"Despite the many studies on stellar nucleosynthesis published so far, the
scenario for the production of Cu in stars remains elusive. In particular, it
is still debated whether copper originates mostly in massive stars or type Ia
supernovae. To answer this question, we compute self-consistent chemical
evolution models taking into account the results of updated stellar
nucleosynthesis. By contrasting copper evolution in Omega Cen and the Milky
Way, we end up with a picture where massive stars are the major responsible for
the production of Cu in Omega Cen as well as the Galactic disc.",2007-03-29T13:25:20Z
"Elucidation of the electronic structure of semiconducting single-walled
  carbon nanotubes by electroabsorption spectroscopy","We report benchmark calculations of electroabsorption in semiconducting
single-walled carbon nanotubes to provide motivation to experimentalists to
perform electroabsorption measurement on these systems. We show that
electroabsorption can detect continuum bands in different energy manifolds,
even as other nonlinear absorption measurements have failed to detect them.
Direct determination of the binding energies of excitons in higher manifolds
thereby becomes possible. We also find that electroabsorption can provide
evidence for Fano-type coupling between the second exciton and the lowest
continuum band states.",2007-01-24T00:59:04Z
"Ettingshausen Effect around Landau Level Filling Factor nu=3 Studied by
  Dynamic Nuclear Polarization","Spin current perpendicular to the electric current is investigated around
Landau level filling factor $\nu=3$ in a GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron
system. Measurements of dynamic nuclear polarization in the vicinity of the
edge of a specially designed Hall bar sample indicate that the direction of the
spin current with respect to the Hall electric field reverses its polarity at
$\nu=3$, where the dissipative current carried by holes in the spin up Landau
level is replaced with that by electrons in the spin down Landau level.",2007-03-13T05:51:04Z
Comments to topological defects in bilayer vesicles,"To explain the details of bilayer vesicle aggregation, we revised the anyon
model for lipid domains formation in closed vesicles of lipid-cholesterol

(Biophys. Journal, 2001, 2003) in frames of the different optical experiments
and atomic-force microscopy.",2007-01-09T13:28:28Z
"Reconstruction of Rb-Rb inter-atomic potential from ultracold Bose-gas
  collision","Scattering phase shifts obtained from 87Rb Bose-gas collision experiments are
used to reconstruct effective potentials resulting, self-consistently, in the
same scattering events observed in the experiments at a particular energy. We
have found that the interaction strength close to the origin suddenly changes
from repulsion to attraction when the collision energy crosses, from below, the
l=2 shape resonance position at E = 275 mikroK. This observation may be
utilized in outlining future Bose-gas collision experiments.",2007-02-24T07:21:53Z
The nature of the rectilinear diameter singularity,"The rigorous explanation for the term $| t |^{2\beta}$ in the rectilinear
diameter equation is given ($t = (T_c-T)/T_c$, $\beta$ is the critical exponent
for the asymptotic form of the equation of state). The optimal order parameter,
for which the branches of binodal are symmetric is constructed within the
canonical formalism. It is shown that the ratio of the amplitudes
$\f{D_{2\beta}}{D_{1-\alpha}}$ before $|t|^{2\beta}$ and $|t|^{1-\alpha}$ where
$\alpha$ determines the behavior of the heat capacity, takes the universal
character. The analysis of entropy for argon and water leads to $\beta = 0.33$
and $\f{D_{2-\beta}}{{D_{1-\alpha}}}\approx - 3.5$.",2007-03-17T18:25:44Z
Semiflexible Polymer Confined in Closed Spaces,"We analyze static properties of a strongly confined semiflexible polymer,
i.e. either trapped in a closed space or compressed by external forces, in an
athermal solvent. Like a flexible polymer case, we can resort to an analogy
with the semidilute solution, but a complication due to the additional length
scale arising from the chain rigidity results in more diverse behaviours
depending on system parameters. For each regime, scaling forms of the excess
free energy of the confinement are derived. Effects of the confinement geometry
and the solvent quality are briefly discussed.",2007-03-13T02:08:52Z
"Phase diagram and thermodynamics of the three-dimensional Bose-Hubbard
  model","We report results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Bose-Hubbard
model in three dimensions. Critical parameters for the
superfluid-to-Mott-insulator transition are determined with significantly
higher accuracy than it has been done in the past. In particular, the position
of the critical point at filling factor n=1 is found to be at (U/t)_c =
29.34(2), and the insulating gap Delta is measured with accuracy of a few
percent of the hopping amplitude t. We obtain the effective mass of particle
and hole excitations in the insulating state--with explicit demonstration of
the emerging particle-hole symmetry and relativistic dispersion law at the
transition tip--along with the sound velocity in the strongly correlated
superfluid phase. These parameters are the necessary ingredients to perform
analytic estimates of the low temperature (T << Delta) thermodynamics in
macroscopic samples. We present accurate thermodynamic curves, including these
for specific heat and entropy, for typical insulating (U/t=40) and superfluid
(t/U=0.0385) phases. Our data can serve as a basis for accurate experimental
thermometry, and a guide for appropriate initial conditions if one attempts to
use interacting bosons in quantum information processing.",2007-01-09T16:38:22Z
"Shaping the Beam of Light in Nanometer Scales: A Yagi-Uda Nanoantenna in
  Optical Domain","A Yagi-Uda-like optical nanoantenna concept using resonant core-shell
plasmonic particles as its ""reflectors"" and ""directors"" is studied numerically.
Such particles when placed near an optical dipole source in a certain
arrangement may exhibit large induced dipole moments, resulting in shaping the
far-field radiation pattern, analogous to the far field of classical Yagi-Uda
antennas in the microwave regime. Variation of the ratio of radii in concentric
core-shell nanostructure is used to tailor the phase of the polarizabilities of
the particles, and consequently the antenna's far-field pattern. The idea of a
nanospectrum analyzer is also briefly proposed for molecular spectroscopy.",2007-03-03T00:43:13Z
Spin-phonon coupling in antiferromagnetic chromium spinels,"The temperature dependence of eigenfrequencies and intensities of the IR
active modes has been investigated for the antiferromagnetic chromium spinel
compounds CdCr2O4, ZnCr2O4, ZnCr2S4, ZnCr2Se4, and HgCr2S4 by IR spectroscopy
for temperatures from 5 K to 300 K. At the transition into the magnetically
ordered phases, and driven by spin-phonon coupling, most compounds reveal
significant splittings of the phonon modes. This is true for geometrically
frustrated CdCr2O4, and ZnCr2O4, for bond frustrated ZnCr2S4 and for ZnCr2Se4,
which also is bond frustrated, but dominated by ferromagnetic exchange. The
pattern of splitting is different for the different compounds and crucially
depends on the nature of frustration and of the resulting spin order. HgCr2S4,
which is almost ferromagnetic, exhibits no splitting of the eigenfrequencies,
but shows significant shifts due to ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.",2007-01-04T17:16:08Z
Entropy production and time asymmetry in nonequilibrium fluctuations,"The time-reversal symmetry of nonequilibrium fluctuations is experimentally
investigated in two out-of-equilibrium systems namely, a Brownian particle in a
trap moving at constant speed and an electric circuit with an imposed mean
current. The dynamical randomness of their nonequilibrium fluctuations is
characterized in terms of the standard and time-reversed entropies per unit
time of dynamical systems theory. We present experimental results showing that
their difference equals the thermodynamic entropy production in units of
Boltzmann's constant.",2007-03-27T06:57:12Z
"The First Appearance of the Red Sequence of Galaxies in Proto-Clusters
  at 2<~z<~3","We explore the evolved galaxy population in the proto-clusters around four
high-z radio galaxies at 2<~z<~3 based on wide-field near-infrared imaging.
Three of the four fields are known proto-clusters as demonstrated by
overdensities of line emitting galaxies at the same redshifts as the radio
galaxies. We imaged the fields of three targets (PKS1138-262, USS0943-242 and
MRC0316-257) to a depth of Ks~22 (5sigma) over a 4'x7' area centered on the
radio galaxies with a new wide-field NIR camera, MOIRCS, on the Subaru
Telescope. Another target (USS1558-003) was observed with SOFI on the NTT to a
depth of Ks=20.5 over a 5'x5' area. We apply colour cuts in J-Ks and/or JHKs in
order to exclusively search for galaxies located at high redshifts: z>2. To the
5sigma limiting magnitudes, we see a significant excess of NIR selected
galaxies by a factor of two to three compared to those found in the field of
GOODS-South. The spatial distribution of these NIR selected galaxies is not
uniform and traces structures similar to those of emission line galaxies,
although the samples of NIR selected galaxies and emitters show little overlap.
We focus on the NIR colour-magnitude sequence of the evolved population and
find that the bright-end (M_{stars}>10^{11}Msun) of the red sequence is well
populated by z~2 but much less so in the z~3 proto-clusters. This may imply
that the bright-end of the colour-magnitude sequence first appeared between z=3
and 2, an era coinciding with the appearance of submm galaxies and the peak of
the cosmic star formation rate. Our observations show that during the same
epoch, massive galaxies are forming in high density environments by vigorous
star formation and assembly.",2007-03-15T01:19:47Z
Intermediate scale phenomena in cuprates,"After 20 years of research the low energy physics of cuprates remains a
mystery. It is generally accepted that a three band Hamiltonian with Cu's and
O's orbitals should contain the essential physics so we can say that there is
consensus at the length scale of the Cu-O distance but there is disagreement
when it comes to describe higher length scales or to set up a low energy model.
Here we present computations of cuprates which accurately describe the physics
arising at scales of up to several lattice constants. We review the comparison
of our results with different proves as resonant X-ray scattering, scanning
tunneling microscopy, optical conductivity and magnetic neutron scattering.",2007-03-30T10:47:15Z
Bounds on ordered codes and orthogonal arrays,"We derive new estimates of the size of codes and orthogonal arrays in the
ordered Hamming space (the Niederreiter-Rosenbloom-Tsfasman space). We also
show that the eigenvalues of the ordered Hamming scheme, the association scheme
that describes the combinatorics of the space, are given by the multivariable
Krawtchouk polynomials, and establish some of their properties.",2007-02-05T21:37:03Z
Role of conformational entropy in force-induced bio-polymer unfolding,"A statistical mechanical description of flexible and semi-flexible polymer
chains in a poor solvent is developed in the constant force and constant
distance ensembles. We predict the existence of many intermediate states at low
temperatures stabilized by the force. A unified response to pulling and
compressing forces has been obtained in the constant distance ensemble. We show
the signature of a cross-over length which increases linearly with the chain
length. Below this cross-over length, the critical force of unfolding decreases
with temperature, while above, it increases with temperature. For stiff chains,
we report for the first time ""saw-tooth"" like behavior in the force-extension
curves which has been seen earlier in the case of protein unfolding.",2007-02-19T13:01:03Z
A Formal Model for Programming Wireless Sensor Networks,"In this paper we present new developments in the expressiveness and in the
theory of a Calculus for Sensor Networks (CSN). We combine a network layer of
sensor devices with a local object model to describe sensor devices with state.
The resulting calculus is quite small and yet very expressive. We also present
a type system and a type invariance result for the calculus. These results
provide the fundamental framework for the development of programming languages
and run-time environments.",2007-02-07T14:17:29Z
Millimeter Wave Localization: Slow Light and Enhanced Absorption,"We exploit millimeter wave technology to measure the reflection and
transmission response of random dielectric media. Our samples are easily
constructed from random stacks of identical, sub-wavelength quartz and Teflon
wafers. The measurement allows us to observe the characteristic transmission
resonances associated with localization. We show that these resonances give
rise to enhanced attenuation even though the attenuation of homogeneous quartz
and Teflon is quite low. We provide experimental evidence of disorder-induced
slow light and superluminal group velocities, which, in contrast to photonic
crystals, are not associated with any periodicity in the system. Furthermore,
we observe localization even though the sample is only about four times the
localization length, interpreting our data in terms of an effective cavity
model. An algorithm for the retrieval of the internal parameters of random
samples (localization length and average absorption rate) from the external
measurements of the reflection and transmission coefficients is presented and
applied to a particular random sample. The retrieved value of the absorption is
in agreement with the directly measured value within the accuracy of the
experiment.",2007-01-22T16:41:30Z
"Four-spin-exchange- and magnetic-field-induced chiral order in two-leg
  spin ladders","We propose a mechanism of a vector chiral long-range order in two-leg
spin-1/2 and spin-1 antiferromagnetic ladders with four-spin exchanges and a
Zeeman term. It is known that for one-dimensional quantum systems, spontaneous
breakdown of continuous symmetries is generally forbidden. Any vector chiral
order hence does not appear in spin-rotationally [SU(2)]-symmetric spin
ladders. However, if a magnetic field is added along the S^z axis of ladders
and the SU(2) symmetry is reduced to the U(1) one, the z component of a vector
chiral order can emerge with the remaining U(1) symmetry unbroken. Making use
of Abelian bosonization techniques, we actually show that a certain type of
four-spin exchange can yield a vector chiral long-range order in spin-1/2 and
spin-1 ladders under a magnetic field. In the chiral-ordered phase, the Z_2
interchain-parity (i.e., chain-exchange) symmetry is spontaneously broken. We
also consider effects of perturbations breaking the parity symmetry.",2007-03-15T07:42:16Z
"Ab-initio design of half-metallic fully-compensated ferrimagnets: the
  case of Cr$_2$MnZ (Z= P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds","Electronic structure calculations from first-principles are employed to
design some new half-metallic fully-compensated ferrimagnets (or as they are
widely known half-metallic antiferromagnets) susceptible of finding
applications in spintronics. Cr$_2$MnZ (Z= P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds have 24
valence electrons per unit cell and calculations show that their total spin
moment is approximately zero for a wide range of lattice constants in agreement
with the Slater-Pauling behavior for ideal half-metals. Simultaneously, the
spin magnetic moments of Cr and Mn atoms are antiparallel and the compounds are
ferrimagnets. Mean-field approximation is employed to estimate their Curie
temperature, which exceeds room temperature for the alloy with Sb. Our findings
suggest that Cr$_2$MnSb is the compound of choice for further experimental
investigations. Contrary to the alloys mentioned above half-metallic
antiferromagnetism is unstable in the case of the Cr$_2$FeZ (Z= Si, Ge, Sn)
alloys.",2007-03-02T20:48:37Z
"Domains in Three-dimensional Ferroelectric Nanostructures: Theory and
  Experiment","Ferroelectric random access memory cells (FeRAMs) have reached 450 x 400 nm
production (0.18 micron^2) at Samsung with lead zirconate-titanate (PZT), 0.13
micron^2 at Matsushita with strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT), and comparable
sizes at Fujitsu with BiFeO3. However, in order to increase storage density,
the industry roadmap requires by 2010 that such planar devices be replaced with
three-dimensional structures. Unfortunately, little is known yet about even
such basic questions as the domain scaling of 3-d nanodevices, as opposed to
2-d thin films. Here we report the experimental measurement of nano-domains in
ferroelectric nanocolumns, together with a theory of domain size in 3-d
structures which explains the observations.",2007-01-09T16:00:56Z
Waves at surfactant-laden liquid-liquid crystal interface,"A theoretical study is presented of surface waves at a monomolecular
surfactant film between an isotropic liquid and a nematic liquid crystal for
the case when the surfactant film is in the isotropic two-dimensional fluid
phase and induces homeotropic (normal to the interface) orientation of the
nematic director. The dispersion relation for the surface waves is obtained,
and different surface modes are analyzed with account being taken of the
anchoring induced by the surfactant layer, the curvature energy of the
interface, and the anisotropy of the viscoelastic coefficients. The dispersion
laws for capillary and dilatational surface modes retain structure similar to
that in isotropic systems, but involve anisotropic viscosity coefficients.
Additional modes are related to relaxation of the nematic director field due to
anchoring at the interface. The results can be used to determine different
properties of nematic-surfactant-isotropic interfaces from experimental data on
surface light scattering.",2007-03-26T15:34:49Z
Critical fields for vortex expulsion from narrow superconducting strips,"We calculate the critical magnetic fields for vortex expulsion for an
infinitely long superconducting strip, using the Ginzburg-Landau formalism. Two
critical fields can be defined associated with the disappearance of either the
energetic stability or metastability of vortices in the center of the strip for
decreasing magnetic fields. We compare the theoretical predictions for the
critical fields in the London formalism with ours and with recently published
experimental results. As expected, for narrow strips our results reproduce
better the experimental findings.",2007-03-28T01:20:56Z
"Investigation of the structure and thermodynamics of star-polymers in
  semi-dilute solution","In this work, we consider a semi-dilute solution of identical star-polymers,
made of attached flexible long polymer chains of the same polymerization degree
N. We first compute the effective pair-potential between star-polymers. Such a
potential results from the excluded volume forces between monomers. We show
that this potential is logarithmic, below some known characteristic distance,
&#963;, depending on the number of attached chains per star-polymer, f, and
volume fraction of polymers, &#966;0 . Beyond &#963;, the potential fails
exponentially. Second, we investigate the structure and thermodynamics of these
star-polymers. To this end, we use the integral equation method with the
hybridized-mean spherical approximation. The numerical resolution of this
equation gives the structure factor of the star-polymers, for various particle
densities. Finally, the standard relationships between thermodynamics and
structure enable us to deduce three physical quantities, namely the isotherm
compressibility, pressure and internal energy, as functions of density.",2007-03-21T21:06:42Z
Beta-NMR of Isolated Lithium in Nearly Ferromagnetic Palladium,"The temperature dependence of the frequency shift and spin-lattice relaxation
rate of isolated, nonmagnetic Li-8 impurities implanted in a nearly
ferromagnetic host (Pd) are measured by means of beta-detected nuclear magnetic
resonance (b-NMR). The shift is negative, very large and increases
monotonically with decreasing T in proportion to the bulk susceptibility of Pd
for T > T*~ 100 K. Below T*, an additional shift occurs which we attribute to
the response of Pd to the defect. The relaxation rate is much slower than
expected for the large shift and is linear with T below T*, showing no sign of
additional relaxation mechanisms associated with the defect.",2007-01-17T01:23:08Z
"Patterns of photometric and chromospheric variation among Sun-like
  stars: A 20-year perspective","We examine patterns of variation of 32 primarily main sequence stars,
extending our previous 7-12 year time series to 13-20 years by combining b, y
data from Lowell Observatory with similar data from Fairborn Observatory.
Parallel chromospheric Ca II H and K emission data from the Mount Wilson
Observatory span the entire interval. The extended data strengthen the
relationship between chromospheric and photometric variation derived
previously. Twenty-seven stars are deemed variable. On a year-to-year timescale
young active stars become fainter when their Ca II emission increases while
older less active stars such as the Sun become brighter when their Ca II
emission increases. The Sun's total irradiance variation, scaled to the b and y
filter photometry, still appears to be somewhat smaller than stars in our
limited sample with similar mean chromospheric activity, but we now regard this
discrepancy as probably due mainly to our limited stellar sample",2007-03-15T18:45:53Z
Properties of low density quantum fluids within nanopores,"The behavior of quantum fluids (4He and H2) within nanopores is explored in
various regimes, using several different methods. A focus is the evolution of
each fluid's behavior as pore radius R is increased. Results are derived with
the path integral Monte Carlo method for the finite temperature (T) behavior of
quasi-one-dimensional (1D) liquid 4He and liquid H2, within pores of varying R.
Results are also obtained, using a density functional method, for the T=0
behavior of 4He in pores of variable R.",2007-02-08T23:51:57Z
"The convective envelope in gamma Doradus stars: theoretical
  uncertainties","The depth of the convective envelope plays a fundamental role in the driving
mechanism proposed by Guzik et al. (2000) to explain the high-order g modes of
gamma Dor pulsators. In this poster we study the sensitivity of the convective
envelope depth to the description of convective transport, to relevant physical
processes, such as microscopic diffusion, and to other uncertainties in
theoretical stellar models.",2007-03-15T16:52:06Z
Observing Spin Polarization of Individual Magnetic Adatoms,"We have used spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy to observe the
spin-polarization state of individual Fe and Cr atoms adsorbed onto Co
nanoislands. Both of these magnetic adatoms exhibit stationary out-of-plane
spin-polarization due to their direct exchange interaction with the substrate,
but the sign of the exchange coupling between electron states of the adatom and
the surface state of the Co island is opposite for the two: Fe adatoms exhibit
parallel spin-polarization to the Co surface state while Cr adatoms exhibit
antiparallel spin-polarization. First-principles calculations predict
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic alignment of the spin moment for individual
Fe and Cr adatoms on a Co film, respectively, implying negative
spin-polarization for Fe and Cr adatoms over the energy range of the Co surface
state.",2007-03-28T05:02:51Z
Excitonic giant Zeeman effect in GaN:Mn^3+,"We describe a direct observation of the excitonic giant Zeeman splitting in
(Ga,Mn)N, a wide-gap III-V diluted magnetic semiconductor. Reflectivity and
absorption spectra measured at low temperatures display the A and B excitons,
with a shift under magnetic field due to s,p-d exchange interactions. Using an
excitonic model, we determine the difference of exchange integrals between
Mn^3+ and free carriers in GaN, N_0(alpha-beta)=-1.2 +/- 0.2 eV. Assuming a
reasonable value of alpha, this implies a positive sign of beta which
corresponds to a rarely observed ferromagnetic interaction between the magnetic
ions and the holes.",2007-03-02T20:12:35Z
"Electromagnetic response and effective gauge theory of graphene in a
  magnetic field","The electromagnetic response of graphene in a magnetic field is studied, with
particular emphasis on the quantum features of its ground state (vacuum). The
graphene vacuum, unlike in conventional quantum Hall systems, is a dielectric
medium and carries an appreciable amount of electric and magnetic
susceptibilities. The dielectric effect grows rapidly with increasing filling
factor nu in such a way that reflects the 'relativistic' Landau-level
characteristics of graphene as well as its valley and spin degeneracy. A close
look into the dielectric function also reveals that the Coulomb interaction is
efficiently screened on the scale of the magnetic length, leading to a
prominent reduction of the exciton spectra in graphene. In addition, an
effective gauge theory of graphene is constructed out of the response. It is
pointed out thereby that the electric susceptibility is generally expressed as
a ratio of the Hall conductance to the Landau gap.",2007-02-28T10:26:30Z
A Hike in the Phases of the 1-in-3 Satisfiability,"We summarise our results for the random $\epsilon$--1-in-3 satisfiability

Hard/Easy transitions.",2007-02-18T16:27:49Z
Magnetic Susceptibility of the Kagome Antiferromagnet ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2,"We analyze the experimental data for the magnetic susceptibility of the

both out-of-plane and in-plane Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) anisotropies, with
explicit theoretical calculations using the Numerical Linked Cluster (NLC)
method and exact diagonalization (ED). The high-temperature experimental data
are well described by the pure Heisenberg model with J=170 K. We show that the
sudden upturn in the susceptibility around T=75 K is due to DM interactions. We
also observe that at intermediate temperatures, below T=J, our calculated
susceptibility for KLHM fits well with a power law T^{-0.25}.",2007-01-04T21:22:46Z
Mechanism of electron localization in a quantum wire,"We show that quasi-bound electron states are formed in a quantum wire as a
result of electron backscattering in the transition regions between the wire
and the electron reservoirs, to which the wire is coupled. The backscattering
mechanism is caused by electron density oscillations arising even in smooth
transitions due to the reflection of electrons not transmitting through the
wire. The quasi-bound states reveal themselves in resonances of the electron
transmission probability through the wire. The calculations were carried out
within the Hartree-Fock approximation using quasiclassic wavefunctions.",2007-03-09T13:15:02Z
"Finite Volume Analysis of Nonlinear Thermo-mechanical Dynamics of Shape
  Memory Alloys","In this paper, the finite volume method is developed to analyze coupled
dynamic problems of nonlinear thermoelasticity. The major focus is given to the
description of martensitic phase transformations essential in the modelling of
shape memory alloys. Computational experiments are carried out to study the
thermo-mechanical wave interactions in a shape memory alloy rod, and a patch.
Both mechanically and thermally induced phase transformations, as well as
hysteresis effects, in a one-dimensional structure are successfully simulated
with the developed methodology. In the two-dimensional case, the main focus is
given to square-to-rectangular transformations and examples of martensitic
combinations under different mechanical loadings are provided.",2007-02-28T13:00:33Z
Free deconvolution for signal processing applications,"Situations in many fields of research, such as digital communications,
nuclear physics and mathematical finance, can be modelled with random matrices.
When the matrices get large, free probability theory is an invaluable tool for
describing the asymptotic behaviour of many systems. It will be shown how free
probability can be used to aid in source detection for certain systems. Sample
covariance matrices for systems with noise are the starting point in our source
detection problem. Multiplicative free deconvolution is shown to be a method
which can aid in expressing limit eigenvalue distributions for sample
covariance matrices, and to simplify estimators for eigenvalue distributions of
covariance matrices.",2007-01-04T18:53:14Z
High resolution science with high redshift galaxies,"We summarize the high-resolution science that has been done on high redshift
galaxies with Adaptive Optics (AO) on the world's largest ground-based
facilities and with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These facilities
complement each other. Ground-based AO provides better light gathering power
and in principle better resolution than HST, giving it the edge in high spatial
resolution imaging and high resolution spectroscopy. HST produces higher
quality, more stable PSF's over larger field-of-view's in a much darker
sky-background than ground-based AO, and yields deeper wide-field images and
low-resolution spectra than the ground. Faint galaxies have steadily decreasing
sizes at fainter fluxes and higher redshifts, reflecting the hierarchical
formation of galaxies over cosmic time. HST has imaged this process in great
structural detail to z<~6, and ground-based AO and spectroscopy has provided
measurements of their masses and other physical properties with cosmic time.
Last, we review how the 6.5 meter James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will
measure First Light, reionization, and galaxy assembly in the near--mid-IR
after 2013.",2007-03-08T08:22:46Z
"Exact diagonalization study of Mott transition in the Hubbard model on
  an anisotropic triangular lattice","We study Mott transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model on an
anisotropic triangular lattice. We use the Lanczos exact diagonalization of
finite-size clusters up to eighteen sites, and calculate Drude weight, charge
gap, double occupancy and spin structure factor. We average these physical
quantities over twisted boundary conditions in order to reduce finite-size
effects. We find a signature of the Mott transition in the dependence of the
Drude weight and/or charge gap on the system size. We also examine the
possibility of antiferromagnetic order from the spin structure factor.
Combining these information, we propose a ground-state phase diagram which has
a nonmagnetic insulating phase between a metallic phase and an insulating phase
with antiferromagnetic order. Finally, we compare our results with those
reported in the previous theoretical studies, and discuss the possibility of an
unconventional insulating state.",2007-03-05T04:31:17Z
"Forward modelling of sub-photospheric flows for time-distance
  helioseismology","Results of forward modelling of acoustic wave propagation in a realistic
solar sub-photosphere with two cases of steady horizontal flows are presented
and analysed by the means of local helioseismology. The simulations are based
on fully compressible ideal hydrodynamical modelling in a Cartesian grid. The
initial model is characterised by solar density and pressure stratifications
taken from the standard Model S and is adjusted in order to suppress convective
instability. Acoustic waves are excited by a non-harmonic source located below
the depth corresponding to the visible surface of the Sun. Numerical
experiments with coherent horizontal flows of linear and Gaussian dependences
of flow speed on depth are carried out. These flow fields may mimic horizontal
motions of plasma surrounding a sunspot, differential rotation or meridional
circulation. An inversion of the velocity profiles from the simulated travel
time differences is carried out. The inversion is based on the ray
approximation. The results of inversion are then compared with the original
velocity profiles. The influence of steady flow on the propagation of sound
waves through the solar interior is analysed. Further, we propose a method of
obtaining the travel-time differences for the waves propagating in
sub-photospheric solar regions with horizontal flows. The method employs
directly the difference between travel-time diagrams of waves propagating with
and against the background flow. The analysis shows that the flow speed
profiles obtained from inversion based on the ray approximation differ from the
original ones. The difference between them is caused by the fact that the wave
packets propagate along the ray bundle, which has a finite extent, and thus
reach deeper regions of the sub-photosphere in comparison with ray theory.",2007-03-05T18:05:23Z
Electrostatics and confinement in Einstein's unified field theory,"A way for appending sources at the right-hand sides of the field equations of
Einstein's unified field theory is recalled. Two exact solutions endowed with
point sources in equilibrium are shown, and their physical meaning is
discussed.",2007-01-11T15:37:59Z
"Superconductivity, Charge Orderings and Phase Separations in Systems
  with Local Electron Pairing","We study two effective models developed for description of superconductors
with short-coherence length: (i) the extended Hubbard model with on-site
attraction and intersite repulsion, (ii) the model of hard-core charged bosons
on a lattice. The analysis is concentrated on the problem of phase separations
and competition between superconductivity (SS) and charge-density-wave (CDW)
orderings. The phase diagrams of the systems are shown to consist of at least
seven different states, including 3 types of phase separated (PS) states:
CDW-SS (PS1), CDW-normal (PS2) and the state of electron droplets (PS3). By
taking into account the PS states and the effects of longer-range
density-density interactions (beyond nearest neighbours) our work substantially
generalizes and modifies the conclusions of previous works concerning the
models considered.",2007-02-27T11:33:25Z
A Generalized Rate Model for Neuronal Ensembles,"There has been a long-standing controversy whether information in neuronal
networks is carried by the firing rate code or by the firing temporal code. The
current status of the rivalry between the two codes is briefly reviewed with
the recent studies such as the brain-machine interface (BMI). Then we have
proposed a generalized rate model based on the {\it finite} $N$-unit Langevin
model subjected to additive and/or multiplicative noises, in order to
understand the firing property of a cluster containing $N$ neurons. The
stationary property of the rate model has been studied with the use of the
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) method. Our rate model is shown to yield various
kinds of stationary distributions such as the interspike-interval distribution
expressed by non-Gaussians including gamma, inverse-Gaussian-like and
log-normal-like distributions.
  The dynamical property of the generalized rate model has been studied with
the use of the augmented moment method (AMM) which was developed by the author
[H. Hasegawa, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 75 (2006) 033001]. From the macroscopic point
of view in the AMM, the property of the $N$-unit neuron cluster is expressed in
terms of {\it three} quantities; $\mu$, the mean of spiking rates of $R=(1/N)
\sum_i r_i$ where $r_i$ denotes the firing rate of a neuron $i$ in the cluster:
$\gamma$, averaged fluctuations in local variables ($r_i$): $\rho$,
fluctuations in global variable ($R$). We get equations of motions of the three
quantities, which show $\rho \sim \gamma/N$ for weak couplings. This implies
that the population rate code is generally more reliable than the single-neuron
rate code. Our rate model is extended and applied to an ensemble containing
multiple neuron clusters.",2007-03-20T05:25:33Z
Cubic Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Coupling in 2D Electron Quantum Dots,"We study effects of the oft-neglected cubic Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling
(i.e., $\propto p^3$) in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots. Using a semiclassical
billiard model, we estimate the magnitude of the spin-orbit induced avoided
crossings in a closed quantum dot in a Zeeman field. Using these results,
together with previous analyses based on random matrix theory, we calculate
corresponding effects on the conductance through an open quantum dot. Combining
our results with an experiment on conductance through an 8 um^2 quantum dot [D
M Zumbuhl et al., Phys. Rev. B 72, 081305 (2005)] suggests that 1) the GaAs
Dresselhaus coupling constant, $\gamma$, is approximately 9 eVA^3,
significantly less than the commonly cited value of 27.5 eVA^3 and 2) the
majority of the spin-flip component of spin-orbit coupling can come from the
cubic Dresselhaus term.",2007-02-28T01:00:03Z
Dielectrophoretically Assembled Polymer Nanowires for Gas Sensing,"We measured the electronic properties and gas sensing response of nanowires
containing segments of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT/PSS) that were synthesized using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes.
The nanowires have a ""striped"" structure of gold-PEDOT/PSS-gold and are
typically 8 um long (1 um-6 um-1 um for each section, respectively) and 220 nm
in diameter. Dielectrophoretic assembly was used to position single nanowires
on pre-fabricated gold electrodes. A polymer conductivity of 11.5 +/- 0.7 S/cm
and a contact resistance of 27.6 +/- 4 kOhm were inferred from resistance
measurements of nanowires of varying length and diameter. When used as gas
sensors, the wires showed a resistance change of 10.5%, 9%, and 4% at the
saturation vapor pressure of acetone, methanol and ethanol, respectively.
Sensor response and recovery were rapid (seconds) with excellent
reproducibility in time and across devices. ""Striped"" template-grown nanowires
are thus intriguing candidates for use in electronic nose vapor sensing
systems.",2007-02-26T21:48:26Z
"High energy kink in the single particle spectra of the two-dimensional
  Hubbard model","Employing dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo calculations we show that the
single particle spectral weight A(k,w) of the one-band two-dimensional Hubbard
model displays a high energy kink in the quasiparticle dispersion followed by a
steep dispersion of a broad peak similar to recent ARPES results reported for
the cuprates. Based on the agreement between the Monte Carlo results and a
simple calculation which couples the quasiparticle to spin fluctuations, we
conclude that the kink and the broad spectral feature in the Hubbard model
spectra is due to scattering with damped high energy spin fluctuations.",2007-01-18T05:18:23Z
Excited states from time-dependent density functional theory,"Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is presently enjoying
enormous popularity in quantum chemistry, as a useful tool for extracting
electronic excited state energies. This article explains what TDDFT is, and how
it differs from ground-state DFT. We show the basic formalism, and illustrate
with simple examples. We discuss its implementation and possible sources of
error. We discuss many of the major successes and challenges of the theory,
including weak fields, strong fields, continuum states, double excitations,
charge transfer, high harmonic generation, multiphoton ionization, electronic
quantum control, van der Waals interactions, transport through single
molecules, currents, quantum defects, and, elastic electron-atom scattering.",2007-03-22T18:23:55Z
"Concentration-dependent mobility in organic field-effect transistors
  probed by infrared spectromicroscopy of the charge density profile","We show that infrared imaging of the charge density profile in organic
field-effect transistors (FETs) can probe transport characteristics which are
difficult to access by conventional contact-based measurements. Specifically,
we carry out experiments and modeling of infrared spectromicroscopy of
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) FETs in which charge injection is affected by a
relatively low resistance of the gate insulators. We conclude that the mobility
of P3HT has a power-law density dependence, which is consistent with the
activated transport in disorder-induced tails of the density of states.",2007-03-19T19:15:53Z
The Origin of Tunneling Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Break Junctions,"First-principles calculations of electron tunneling transport in Ni and Co
break junctions reveal strong dependence of the conductance on the
magnetization direction, an effect known as tunneling anisotropic
magnetoresistance (TAMR). The origin of this phenomenon stems from resonant
states localized in the electrodes near the junction break. The energy and
broadening of these states is strongly affected by the magnetization
orientation due to spin-orbit coupling, causing TAMR to be sensitive to bias
voltage on a scale of a few mV. Our results bear a resemblance to recent
experimental data and suggest that TAMR driven by resonant states is a general
phenomenon typical for magnetic broken contacts and other experimental
geometries where a magnetic tip is used to probe electron transport.",2007-03-13T15:18:26Z
Application of Thomas-Fermi model to fullerene molecule and nanotube,"Semiclassical description, based on electrostatics and Thomas-Fermi model is
applied here to calculate dimensions of the electronic shell of a fullerene
molecule and a nanotube. The internal radius of the electronic shell of a
fullerene molecule, calculated within the framework of the model is 0.2808 nm.
The external radius is 0.4182 nm. The experimental values are 0.279 nm and
0.429 nm correspondingly. This shows that semiclassical approach provides
rather good description of the dimensions of the electronic shell in a
fullerene molecule. Two types of dipole oscillations in a fullerene molecule
are considered and their frequencies are calculated. Similar calculations are
performed for a nanotube also. For a nanotube with a radius of the cylinder of
the ions, Rn = 0.7 nm, the internal radius of the electronic shell, calculated
within the framework of the model is 0.577 nm. The external radius is 0.816 nm.
Three types of dipole oscillations in nanotube are considered and their
frequencies are calculated.",2007-02-04T10:28:57Z
Phase-space theory for dispersive detectors of superconducting qubits,"Motivated by recent experiments, we study the dynamics of a qubit
quadratically coupled to its detector, a damped harmonic oscillator. We use a
complex-environment approach, explicitly describing the dynamics of the qubit
and the oscillator by means of their full Floquet state master equations in
phase-space. We investigate the backaction of the environment on the measured
qubit and explore several measurement protocols, which include a long-term full
read-out cycle as well as schemes based on short time transfer of information
between qubit and oscillator. We also show that the pointer becomes measurable
before all information in the qubit has been lost.",2007-02-28T22:32:10Z
"A note on rate-distortion functions for nonstationary Gaussian
  autoregressive processes","Source coding theorems and Shannon rate-distortion functions were studied for
the discrete-time Wiener process by Berger and generalized to nonstationary
Gaussian autoregressive processes by Gray and by Hashimoto and Arimoto.
Hashimoto and Arimoto provided an example apparently contradicting the methods
used in Gray, implied that Gray's rate-distortion evaluation was not correct in
the nonstationary case, and derived a new formula that agreed with previous
results for the stationary case and held in the nonstationary case. In this
correspondence it is shown that the rate-distortion formulas of Gray and
Hashimoto and Arimoto are in fact consistent and that the example of of
Hashimoto and Arimoto does not form a counter example to the methods or results
of the earlier paper. Their results do provide an alternative, but equivalent,
formula for the rate-distortion function in the nonstationary case and they
provide a concrete example that the classic Kolmogorov formula differs from the
autoregressive formula when the autoregressive source is not stationary. Some
observations are offered on the different versions of the Toeplitz asymptotic
eigenvalue distribution theorem used in the two papers to emphasize how a
slight modification of the classic theorem avoids the problems with certain
singularities.",2007-02-25T16:47:29Z
"Nonexistence of ""Spin Transverse Force"" for a Relativistic Electron","Using the complete Dirac Hamiltonian for a relativistic electron it is shown
that the spin transverse force derived by S.Q. Shen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,
187203 (2005) does not exist. This force is an artefact resulting from an
approximate form of the employed Hamiltonian.",2007-01-16T14:29:18Z
The blast wave of Tycho's supernova remnant,"We use the Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the region in the Tycho
supernova remnant between the blast wave and the shocked ejecta interface or
contact discontinuity. This zone contains all the history of the shock-heated
gas and cosmic-ray acceleration in the remnant. We present for the first time
evidence for significant spatial variations of the X-ray synchrotron emission
in the form of spectral steepening from a photon index of 2.6 right at the
blast wave to a value of 3.0 several arcseconds behind. We interpret this
result along with the profiles of radio and X-ray intensity using a
self-similar hydrodynamical model including cosmic ray backreaction that
accounts for the observed ratio of radii between the blast wave and contact
discontinuity. Two different assumptions were made about the post-shock
magnetic field evolution: one where the magnetic field (amplified at the shock)
is simply carried by the plasma flow and remains relatively high in the
post-shock region [synchrotron losses limited rim case], and another where the
amplified magnetic field is rapidly damped behind the blast wave [magnetic
damping case]. Both cases fairly well describe the X-ray data, however both
fail to explain the observed radio profile. The projected synchrotron emission
leaves little room for the presence of thermal emission from the shocked
ambient medium. This can only be explained if the pre-shock ambient medium
density in the vicinity of the Tycho supernova remnant is below 0.6 cm-3.",2007-03-10T09:27:04Z
Spatial Determination of Magnetic Avalanche Ignition Points,"Using time-resolved measurements of local magnetization in the molecular
magnet Mn12-ac, we report studies of the propagation of magnetic avalanches
(fast magnetization reversals) that originate from points inside the crystals
rather than at the edges. The curved nature of the fronts produced by
avalanches is reflected in the time-of-arrival at micro-Hall sensors placed at
the surface of the sample. Assuming that the avalanche interface is a spherical
bubble that grows with a radius proportional to time, we are able to locate the
approximate ignition point of each avalanche in a two-dimensional cross-section
of the crystal. For the samples used in these studies, avalanches in a given
crystal are found to originate in a small region with a radius of roughly 150
microns.",2007-03-16T18:41:27Z
Vector Field Induced Chaos in Multi-dimensional Homogeneous Cosmologies,"We show that in multidimensional gravity vector fields completely determine
the structure and properties of singularity. It turns out that in the presence
of a vector field the oscillatory regime exists for any number of spatial
dimensions and for all homogeneous models. We derive the Poincar\'e return map
associated to the Kasner indexes and fix the rules according to which the
Kasner vectors rotate. In correspondence to a 4-dimensional space time, the
oscillatory regime here constructed overlap the usual
Belinski-Khalatnikov-Liftshitz one.",2007-01-16T14:11:46Z
"Theory of Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling and Dissipation in High-Tc
  Josephson Junctions","We have investigated macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in in-plane high-Tc
superconductor Josephson junctions and the influence of the nodal-quasiparticle
and the zero energy bound states (ZES) on MQT. We have shown that the presence
of the ZES at the interface between the insulator and the superconductor leads
to strong Ohmic quasiparticle dissipation. Therefore, the MQT rate is
noticeably suppressed in comparison with the c-axis junctions in which ZES are
completely absent.",2007-01-30T04:21:47Z
"Control of electron spin decoherence caused by electron-nuclear spin
  dynamics in a quantum dot","Control of electron spin decoherence in contact with a mesoscopic bath of
many interacting nuclear spins in an InAs quantum dot is studied by solving the
coupled quantum dynamics. The nuclear spin bath, because of its bifurcated
evolution predicated on the electron spin up or down state, measures the
which-state information of the electron spin and hence diminishes its
coherence. The many-body dynamics of nuclear spin bath is solved with a
pair-correlation approximation. In the relevant timescale, nuclear pair-wise
flip-flops, as elementary excitations in the mesoscopic bath, can be mapped
into the precession of non-interacting pseudo-spins. Such mapping provides a
geometrical picture for understanding the decoherence and for devising control
schemes. A close examination of nuclear bath dynamics reveals a wealth of
phenomena and new possibilities of controlling the electron spin decoherence.
For example, when the electron spin is flipped by a $\pi$-pulse at $\tau$, its
coherence will partially recover at $\sqrt{2}\tau$ as a consequence of quantum
disentanglement from the mesoscopic bath. In contrast to the re-focusing of
inhomogeneously broadened phases by conventional spin-echoes, the
disentanglement is realized through shepherding quantum evolution of the bath
state via control of the quantum object. A concatenated construction of pulse
sequences can eliminate the decoherence with arbitrary accuracy, with the
nuclear-nuclear spin interaction strength acting as the controlling small
parameter.",2007-03-27T08:14:16Z
"Critical Binder cumulant for isotropic Ising models on square and
  triangular lattices","Using Monte Carlo techniques, the critical Binder cumulant U* of isotropic
nearest-neighbour Ising models on square and triangular lattices is studied.
For rectangular shapes, employing periodic boundary conditions, U* is found to
show the same dependence on the aspect ratio for both lattice types. Similarly,
applying free boundary conditions for systems with square as well as circular
shapes for both lattices, the simulational findings are also consistent with
the suggestion that, for isotropic Ising models with short-range interactions,
U* depends on the shape and the boundary condition, but not on the lattice
structure.",2007-01-22T12:38:13Z
"A Direct Probe of Electronic Nematic Order; Symmetry Information in
  Scanning Tunneling Microscope Images","An electronic nematic state spontaneously breaks a point-group symmetry of an
underlying lattice. As a result, the nematic-isotropic transition accompanies a
Fermi surface distortion. However, the anisotropic nature of the nematic state
at a macroscopic scale can be easily wiped out when domains of different
orientations of nematic order exist. We suggest that a spatial pattern of local
density of states (LDOS) in the presence of a non-magnetic impurity can be a
direct probe of the nematic order. We study various patterns of LDOS across the
quantum phase transition between the isotropic and nematic phases. Especially
the Fourier transformed local density of states (FT-LDOS), which can be deduced
from scanning tunneling microscope images, represent a transparent symmetry of
an electronic structure. The application of our results to the bilayer
ruthenate, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is also discussed.",2007-03-01T21:00:06Z
Spin qubits with electrically gated polyoxometalate molecules,"Spin qubits offer one of the most promising routes to the implementation of
quantum computers. Very recent results in semiconductor quantum dots show that
electrically-controlled gating schemes are particularly well-suited for the
realization of a universal set of quantum logical gates. Scalability to a
larger number of qubits, however, remains an issue for such semiconductor
quantum dots. In contrast, a chemical bottom-up approach allows one to produce
identical units in which localized spins represent the qubits. Molecular
magnetism has produced a wide range of systems with tailored properties, but
molecules permitting electrical gating have been lacking. Here we propose to
use the polyoxometalate [PMo12O40(VO)2]q-, where two localized spins-1/2 can be
coupled through the electrons of the central core. Via electrical manipulation
of the molecular redox potential, the charge of the core can be changed. With
this setup, two-qubit gates and qubit readout can be implemented.",2007-03-19T20:21:01Z
Primordial Perturbations Spectra in a Holographic Phase,"In this paper, we suppose that the universe begins in a holographic thermal
equilibrium phase with the diverged correlation length, and the phase
transition to the radiation phase of standard cosmology goes with the abrupt
reducing of correlation length. In this case, the primordial perturbations may
be induced by thermal fluctuations in this holographic phase. We calculate the
spectra of this holographic primordial perturbations, and find that the scalar
spectrum has a slightly red tilt and the tensor perturbation amplitude has a
moderate ratio, which may be tested in coming observations. The results plotted
in r-n_s plane is similar to that of large field inflation models. However, for
fixed efolding number, they are generally in different positions.",2007-02-13T10:25:38Z
"Extreme value problems in Random Matrix Theory and other disordered
  systems","We review some applications of central limit theorems and extreme values
statistics in the context of disordered systems. We discuss several problems,
in particular concerning Random Matrix Theory and the generalisation of the
Tracy-Widom distribution when the disorder has ``fat tails''. We underline the
relevance of power-law tails for Directed Polymers and mean-field Spin Glasses,
and we point out various open problems and conjectures on these matters. We
find that in many instances the assumption of Gaussian disorder cannot be taken
for granted.",2007-02-09T16:00:12Z
"Excited states of quantum many-body interacting systems: A variational
  coupled-cluster description","We extend recently proposed variational coupled-cluster method to describe
excitation states of quantum many-body interacting systems. We discuss, in
general terms, both quasiparticle excitations and quasiparticle-density-wave
excitations (collective modes). In application to quantum antiferromagnets, we
reproduce the well-known spin-wave excitations, i.e. quasiparticle magnons of
spin $\pm 1$. In addition, we obtain new, spin-zero magnon-density-wave
excitations which has been missing in Anserson's spin-wave theory. Implications
of these new collective modes are discussed.",2007-01-19T16:34:03Z
"Magneto-elastic effects and magnetization plateaus in two dimensional
  systems","We show the importance of both strong frustration and spin-lattice coupling
for the stabilization of magnetization plateaus in translationally invariant
two-dimensional systems. We consider a frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg model
coupled to adiabatic phonons under an external magnetic field. At zero
magnetization, simple structures with two or at most four spins per unit cell
are stabilized, forming dimers or $2 \times 2$ plaquettes, respectively. A much
richer scenario is found in the case of magnetization $m=1/2$, where larger
unit cells are formed with non-trivial spin textures and an analogy with the
corresponding classical Ising model is detectable. Specific predictions on
lattice distortions and local spin values can be directly measured by X-rays
and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments.",2007-01-08T15:04:42Z
"Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and
  stigmergy to the global brain","Evolution is presented as a trial-and-error process that produces a
progressive accumulation of knowledge. At the level of technology, this leads
to ephemeralization, i.e. ever increasing productivity, or decreasing of the
friction that normally dissipates resources. As a result, flows of matter,
energy and information circulate ever more easily across the planet. This
global connectivity increases the interactions between agents, and thus the
possibilities for conflict. However, evolutionary progress also reduces social
friction, via the creation of institutions. The emergence of such ""mediators""
is facilitated by stigmergy: the unintended collaboration between agents
resulting from their actions on a shared environment. The Internet is a near
ideal medium for stigmergic interaction. Quantitative stigmergy allows the web
to learn from the activities of its users, thus becoming ever better at helping
them to answer their queries. Qualitative stigmergy stimulates agents to
collectively develop novel knowledge. Both mechanisms have direct analogues in
the functioning of the human brain. This leads us to envision the future,
super-intelligent web as a ""global brain"" for humanity. The feedback between
social and technological advances leads to an extreme acceleration of
innovation. An extrapolation of the corresponding hyperbolic growth model would
forecast a singularity around 2040. This can be interpreted as the evolutionary
transition to the Global Brain regime.",2007-03-01T15:46:37Z
"Layer-resolved imaging of domain wall interactions in magnetic tunnel
  junction-like trilayers","We have performed a layer-resolved, microscopic study of interactions between
domain walls in two magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic one, using
high-resolution x-ray photoemission electron microscopy. Domain walls in the
hard magnetic Co layer of a Co/Al2O3/FeNi trilayer with in-plane uniaxial
anisotropy strongly modify the local magnetization direction in the soft
magnetic FeNi layer. The stray fields associated to the domain walls lead to an
antiparallel coupling between the local Co and FeNi moments. For domain walls
parallel to the easy magnetization axis this interaction is limited to the
domain wall region itself. For strongly charged (head-on or tail-to-tail)
walls, the antiparallel coupling dominates the interaction over radial
distances up to several micrometers from the centre of the domain wall.",2007-02-27T09:52:46Z
Parametric Resonance of Optically Trapped Aerosols,"The Brownian dynamics of an optically trapped water droplet are investigated
across the transition from over to under-damped oscillations. The spectrum of
position fluctuations evolves from a Lorentzian shape typical of over-damped
systems (beads in liquid solvents), to a damped harmonic oscillator spectrum
showing a resonance peak. In this later under-damped regime, we excite
parametric resonance by periodically modulating the trapping power at twice the
resonant frequency. The power spectra of position fluctuations are in excellent
agreement with the obtained analytical solutions of a parametrically modulated
Langevin equation.",2007-02-23T19:52:51Z
"The first detection of near-infrared CN bands in active galactic nuclei:
  signature of star formation","We present the first detection of the near-infrared CN absorption band in the
nuclear spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN). This feature is a recent star
formation tracer, being particularly strong in carbon stars. The equivalent
width of the CN line correlates with that of the CO at 2.3 microns, as expected
in stellar populations (SP) with ages between ~ 0.2 and ~ 2 Gyr. The presence
of the 1.1 microns CN band in the spectra of the sources is taken as an
unambiguous evidence of the presence of young/intermediate SP close to the
central source of the AGN. Near-infrared bands can be powerful age indicators
for star formation connected to AGN, the understanding of which is crucial in
the context of galaxy formation and AGN feedback.",2007-03-12T16:19:43Z
Majority-vote on directed Small-World networks,"On directed Small-World networks the
  Majority-vote model with noise is now studied through Monte Carlo
simulations. In this model, the order-disorder phase transition of the order
parameter is well defined in this system. We calculate the value of the
critical noise parameter q_c for several values of rewiring probability p of
the directed Small-World network. The critical exponentes beta/nu, gamma/nu and
1/nu were calculated for several values of p.",2007-01-16T17:24:40Z
"Nonlinear transport through a dynamic impurity in a strongly interacting
  one-dimensional electron gas","We analyze the transport properties of a Luttinger liquid with an imbedded
impurity of explicitly time-dependent strength. We employ a radiative boundary
condition formalism to describe the coupling to the voltage sources. Assuming
the impurity time dependence to be oscillatory we present a full analytic
perturbative result in impurity strength for arbitrary interaction parameter
calculated with help of Coulomb gas expansion (CGE). Moreover, a full analytic
solution beyond the above restriction is possible for a special non-trivial
interaction strength which has been achieved independently by full resummation
of CGE series as well as via refermionization technique. The resulting
nonlinear current-voltage characteristic turns out to be very rich due to the
presence of the additional energy scale associated with the impurity
oscillation frequency. In accordance with the previous studies we also find an
enhancement of the linear conductance of the wire to values above the unitary
limit G0 = 2e2/h.",2007-02-13T16:11:06Z
"A Note on the Periodicity and the Output Rate of Bit Search Type
  Generators","We investigate the bit-search type irregular decimation algorithms that are
used within LFSR-based stream ciphers. In particular, we concentrate on BSG and
ABSG, and consider two different setups for the analysis. In the first case,
the input is assumed to be a m-sequence; we show that all possible output
sequences can be classified into two sets, each of which is characterized by
the equivalence of their elements up to shifts. Furthermore, we prove that the
cardinality of each of these sets is equal to the period of one of its elements
and subsequently derive the first known bounds on the expected output period
(assuming that no subperiods exist). In the second setup, we work in a
probabilistic framework and assume that the input sequence is evenly
distributed (i.e., independent identically distributed Bernoulli process with
probability 1/2). Under these assumptions, we derive closed-form expressions
for the distribution of the output length and the output rate, which is shown
to be asymptotically Gaussian-distributed and concentrated around the mean with
exponential tightness.",2007-02-16T16:20:59Z
"Evidence for a floating phase of the transverse ANNNI model at high
  frustration","We study the transverse quantum ANNNI model in the region of high frustration
(k>0.5) using the DMRG algorithm. We obtain a precise determination of the
phase diagram, showing clear evidence for the existence of a floating phase,
separated from the paramagnetic modulated phase by a high-order critical line
ending at the multicritical point. We obtain simple and accurate formulae for
the two critical lines.",2007-02-28T12:15:45Z
"One-bit Distributed Sensing and Coding for Field Estimation in Sensor
  Networks","This paper formulates and studies a general distributed field reconstruction
problem using a dense network of noisy one-bit randomized scalar quantizers in
the presence of additive observation noise of unknown distribution. A
constructive quantization, coding, and field reconstruction scheme is developed
and an upper-bound to the associated mean squared error (MSE) at any point and
any snapshot is derived in terms of the local spatio-temporal smoothness
properties of the underlying field. It is shown that when the noise, sensor
placement pattern, and the sensor schedule satisfy certain weak technical
requirements, it is possible to drive the MSE to zero with increasing sensor
density at points of field continuity while ensuring that the per-sensor
bitrate and sensing-related network overhead rate simultaneously go to zero.
The proposed scheme achieves the order-optimal MSE versus sensor density
scaling behavior for the class of spatially constant spatio-temporal fields.",2007-01-30T22:05:19Z
"Perfectly Conducting Channel and Universality Crossover in Disordered
  Nano-Graphene Ribbons","The band structure of graphene ribbons with zigzag edges have two valleys
well separated in momentum space, related to the two Dirac points of the
graphene spectrum. The propagating modes in each valley contain a single chiral
mode originating from a partially flat band at band center. This feature gives
rise to a perfectly conducting channel in the disordered system, if the
impurity scattering does not connect the two valleys, i.e. for long-range
impurity potentials. Ribbons with short-range impurity potentials, however,
through inter-valley scattering display ordinary localization behavior. The two
regimes belong to different universality classes: unitary for long-range
impurities and orthogonal for short-range impurities.",2007-02-09T02:37:17Z
"Novel dynamical effects and glassy response in strongly correlated
  electronic system","We find an unconventional nucleation of low temperature paramagnetic metal
(PMM) phase with monoclinic structure from the matrix of high-temperature
antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI) phase with tetragonal structure in strongly
correlated electronic system $BaCo_{0.9}Ni_{0.1}S_{1.97}$. Such unconventional
nucleation leads to a decease in resistivity by several orders with relaxation
at a fixed temperature without external perturbation. The novel dynamical
process could arise from the competition of strain fields, Coulomb
interactions, magnetic correlations and disorders. Such competition may
frustrate the nucleation, giving rise to a slow, nonexponential relaxation and
""physical aging"" behavior.",2007-03-25T13:37:12Z
"Microstructure, magneto-transport and magnetic properties of Gd-doped
  magnetron-sputtered amorphous carbon","The magnetic rare earth element gadolinium (Gd) was doped into thin films of
amorphous carbon (hydrogenated \textit{a}-C:H, or hydrogen-free \textit{a}-C)
using magnetron co-sputtering. The Gd acted as a magnetic as well as an
electrical dopant, resulting in an enormous negative magnetoresistance below a
temperature ($T'$). Hydrogen was introduced to control the amorphous carbon
bonding structure. High-resolution electron microscopy, ion-beam analysis and
Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the influence of Gd doping on the
\textit{a-}Gd$_x$C$_{1-x}$(:H$_y$) film morphology, composition, density and
bonding. The films were largely amorphous and homogeneous up to $x$=22.0 at.%.
As the Gd doping increased, the $sp^{2}$-bonded carbon atoms evolved from
carbon chains to 6-member graphitic rings. Incorporation of H opened up the
graphitic rings and stabilized a $sp^{2}$-rich carbon-chain random network. The
transport properties not only depended on Gd doping, but were also very
sensitive to the $sp^{2}$ ordering. Magnetic properties, such as the spin-glass
freezing temperature and susceptibility, scaled with the Gd concentration.",2007-01-26T22:28:00Z
Light-matter interaction in doped microcavities,"We discuss theoretically the light-matter coupling in a microcavity
containing a quantum well with a two-dimensional electron gas. The high density
limit where the bound exciton states are absent is considered. The matrix
element of interband optical absorbtion demonstrates the Mahan singularity due
to strong Coulomb effect between the electrons and a photocreated hole. We
extend the non-local dielectric response theory to calculate the quantum well
reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as the microcavity
transmission spectra. The new eigenmodes of the system are discussed. Their
implications for the steady state and time resolved spectroscopy experiments
are analyzed.",2007-03-10T13:31:10Z
The Origin of Tunneling Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Break Junctions,"First-principles calculations of electron tunneling transport in Ni and Co
break junctions reveal strong dependence of the conductance on the
magnetization direction, an effect known as tunneling anisotropic
magnetoresistance (TAMR). The origin of this phenomenon stems from resonant
states localized in the electrodes near the junction break. The energy and
broadening of these states is strongly affected by the magnetization
orientation due to spin-orbit coupling, causing TAMR to be sensitive to bias
voltage on a scale of a few mV. Our results bear a resemblance to recent
experimental data and suggest that TAMR driven by resonant states is a general
phenomenon typical for magnetic broken contacts and other experimental
geometries where a magnetic tip is used to probe electron transport.",2007-03-13T15:18:26Z
Spectral and Fermi surface properties from Wannier interpolation,"We present an efficient first-principles approach for calculating Fermi
surface averages and spectral properties of solids, and use it to compute the
low-field Hall coefficient of several cubic metals and the magnetic circular
dichroism of iron. The first step is to perform a conventional first-principles
calculation and store the low-lying Bloch functions evaluated on a uniform grid
of k-points in the Brillouin zone. We then map those states onto a set of
maximally-localized Wannier functions, and evaluate the matrix elements of the
Hamiltonian and the other needed operators between the Wannier orbitals, thus
setting up an ``exact tight-binding model.'' In this compact representation the
k-space quantities are evaluated inexpensively using a generalized
Slater-Koster interpolation. Because of the strong localization of the Wannier
orbitals in real space, the smoothness and accuracy of the k-space
interpolation increases rapidly with the number of grid points originally used
to construct the Wannier functions. This allows k-space integrals to be
performed with ab-initio accuracy at low cost. In the Wannier representation,
band gradients, effective masses, and other k-derivatives needed for transport
and optical coefficients can be evaluated analytically, producing numerically
stable results even at band crossings and near weak avoided crossings.",2007-02-23T16:07:14Z
Analysis of Collective Neutrino Flavor Transformation in Supernovae,"We study the flavor evolution of a dense gas initially consisting of pure
mono-energetic $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$. Using adiabatic invariants and the
special symmetry in such a system we are able to calculate the flavor evolution
of the neutrino gas for the cases with slowly decreasing neutrino number
densities. These calculations give new insights into the results of recent
large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor transformation in
supernovae. For example, our calculations reveal the existence of what we term
the ``collective precession mode''. Our analyses suggest that neutrinos which
travel on intersecting trajectories subject to destructive quantum interference
nevertheless can be in this mode. This mode can result in sharp transitions in
the final energy-dependent neutrino survival probabilities across all
trajectories, a feature seen in the numerical simulations. Moreover, this
transition is qualitatively different for the normal and inverted neutrino mass
hierarchies. Exploiting this difference, the neutrino signals from a future
galactic supernova can potentially be used to determine the actual neutrino
mass hierarchy.",2007-03-29T21:40:10Z
"Data Cube: A Relational Aggregation Operator Generalizing Group-By,
  Cross-Tab, and Sub-Totals","Data analysis applications typically aggregate data across many dimensions
looking for anomalies or unusual patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and the
GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional aggregates.
Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. This
paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube
operator generalizes the histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and
sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The novelty is that cubes
are relations. Consequently, the cube operator can be imbedded in more complex
non-procedural data analysis programs. The cube operator treats each of the N
aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular
set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an
N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to
lower dimensional spaces. This paper (1) explains the cube and roll-up
operators, (2) shows how they fit in SQL, (3) explains how users can define new
aggregate functions for cubes, and (4) discusses efficient techniques to
compute the cube. Many of these features are being added to the SQL Standard.",2007-01-25T22:39:37Z
"Microwave photoconductivity of a 2D electron gas: Mechanisms and their
  interplay at high radiation power","We develop a systematic theory of microwave-induced oscillations in the
magnetoresistivity of a two-dimensional electron gas, focusing on the regime of
strongly overlapping Landau levels. At linear order in microwave power, two
novel mechanisms of the oscillations (``quadrupole'' and ``photovoltaic'') are
identified, in addition to those studied before (``displacement'' and
``inelastic''). The quadrupole and photovoltaic mechanisms are shown to be the
only ones that give rise to oscillations in the nondiagonal part of the
photoconductivity tensor. In the diagonal part, the inelastic contribution
dominates at moderate microwave power, while at elevated power the other
mechanisms become relevant. We demonstrate the crucial role of feedback
effects, which lead to a strong interplay of the four mechanisms in the
nonlinear photoresponse and yield, in particular, a nonmonotonic power
dependence of the photoconductivity, narrowing of the magnetoresonances, and a
nontrivial structure of the Hall photoresponse. At ultrahigh power, all effects
related to the Landau quantization decay due to a combination of the feedback
and multiphoton effects, restoring the classical Drude conductivity.",2007-03-05T20:27:39Z
"Microscopic theory of thermal phase slips in clean narrow
  superconducting wires","We consider structure of a thermal phase-slip center for a simple microscopic
model of a clean one-dimensional superconductors in which superconductivity
occurs only within one conducting channel or several identical channels.
Surprisingly, the Eilenberger equations describing the saddle-point
configuration allow for exact analytical solution in the whole temperature and
current range. This solution allows us to derive a closed expression for the
free-energy barrier, which we use to compute its temperature and current
dependences.",2007-03-15T15:54:10Z
"Condensed Matter Physics With Light And Atoms: Strongly Correlated Cold
  Fermions in Optical Lattices","Various topics at the interface between condensed matter physics and the
physics of ultra-cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices are discussed. The
lectures start with basic considerations on energy scales, and on the regimes
in which a description by an effective Hubbard model is valid. Qualitative
ideas about the Mott transition are then presented, both for bosons and
fermions, as well as mean-field theories of this phenomenon. Antiferromagnetism
of the fermionic Hubbard model at half-filling is briefly reviewed. The
possibility that interaction effects facilitate adiabatic cooling is discussed,
and the importance of using entropy as a thermometer is emphasized. Geometrical
frustration of the lattice, by suppressing spin long-range order, helps
revealing genuine Mott physics and exploring unconventional quantum magnetism.
The importance of measurement techniques to probe quasiparticle excitations in
cold fermionic systems is emphasized, and a recent proposal based on stimulated
Raman scattering briefly reviewed. The unconventional nature of these
excitations in cuprate superconductors is emphasized.",2007-02-05T23:27:12Z
Single Wall Carbon Nanotube Weak Links,"We have reproducibly contacted gated single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) to
superconducting leads based on niobium. The devices are identified to belong to
two transparency regimes: The Coulomb blockade and the Kondo regime. Clear
signature of the superconducting leads is observed in both regimes and in the
Kondo regime a narrow zero bias peak interpreted as a proximity induced
supercurrent persist in Coulomb blockade diamonds with Kondo resonances.",2007-03-13T16:23:24Z
MBE Growth of Cubic InN,"Cubic InN films were grown on top of a c-GaN buffer layer by rf-plasma
assisted MBE at different growth temperatures. X-Ray diffraction investigations
show that the c-InN layers consist of a nearly phase-pure zinc blende (cubic)
structure with a small fraction of the wurtzite (hexagonal) phase grown on the
(111) facets of the cubic layer. The content of hexagonal inclusions is
decreasing with decreasing growth temperature. The full-width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of c-InN (002) rocking curve is about 50 arcmin. Low temperature
photoluminescence measurements reveal a band gap of about 0.61eV for cubic InN.",2007-02-06T13:53:33Z
"Vortices and chirality of magnetostatic modes in quasi-2D ferrite disk
  particles","In this paper we show that the vortex states can be created not only in
magnetically soft ""small"" (with the dipolar and exchange energy competition)
cylindrical dots, but also in magnetically saturated ""big"" (when the exchange
is neglected) cylindrical dots. A property associated with a vortex structure
becomes evident from an analysis of confinement phenomena of magnetic
oscillations in a ferrite disk with a dominating role of magnetic-dipolar
(non-exchange-interaction) spectra. In this case the scalar
(magnetostatic-potential) wave functions may have a phase singularity in a
center of a dot. A non-zero azimuth component of the flow velocity demonstrates
the vortex structure. The vortices are guaranteed by the chiral edge states of
magnetic-dipolar modes in a quasi-2D ferrite disk.",2007-02-14T09:34:14Z
"Real-time observation of oxidation and photo-oxidation of rubrene thin
  films by spectroscopic ellipsometry","We follow in real-time and under controlled conditions the oxidation of the
organic semiconductor rubrene grown on SiO_2 using spectroscopic ellipsometry.
We derive the complex dielectric function epsilon_1 + i epsilon_2 for pristine
and oxidized rubrene showing that the oxidation is accompanied by a significant
change of the optical properties, namely the absorption. We observe that
photo-oxidation of rubrene is orders of magnitude faster than oxidation without
illumination. By following different absorption bands (around 2.5eV and 4.0eV
for pristine rubrene and around 4.9eV for oxidized rubrene) we infer that the
observed photo-oxidation of these films involves non-Fickian diffusion
mechanisms.",2007-03-20T16:27:00Z
The origin of the soft excess in high L/L_Edd AGN,"We discuss the origin of the soft X-ray excess seen in AGN. There are clear
advantages to models where this arises from atomic processes in partially
ionised material rather than where it is a true continuum component. However,
current data cannot distinguish between models where this material is seen in
reflection or absorption, even for the archetypal 'reflection dominated' AGN
MCG-6-30-15. Instead, we give physical arguments on the ionisation structure of
X-ray illuminated material which exclude a reflection origin if the disc is in
hydrostatic equilibrium. The same physical processes strongly favour an
absorption origin for the soft excess, giving a more messy picture of the
accretion environment. This implies that these apparently 'reflection
dominated' AGN are not good places to test GR, but they do give insight into
the spectra expected from the first QSO's in the early Universe.",2007-03-16T18:16:54Z
Orientational relaxation in a discotic liquid crystal,"We investigate orientational relaxation of a model discotic liquid crystal,
consists of disc-like molecules, by molecular dynamics simulations along two
isobars starting from the high temperature isotropic phase. The two isobars
have been so chosen that (A) the phase sequence isotropic (I)-nematic
(N)-columnar (C) appears upon cooling along one of them and (B) the sequence
isotropic (I)-columnar (C) along the other. While the orientational relaxation
in the isotropic phase near the I-N phase transition in system (A) shows a
power law decay at short to intermediate times, such power law relaxation is
not observed in the isotropic phase near the I-C phase boundary in system (B).
In order to understand this difference (the existence or the absence of the
power law decay), we calculated the the growth of the orientational pair
distribution functions (OPDF) near the I-N phase boundary and also near the I-C
phase boundary. We find that OPDF shows a marked growth in long range
correlation as the I-N phase boundary is approached in the I-N-C system (A),
but such a growth is absent in the I-C system, which appears to be consistent
with the result that I-N phase transition in the former is weakly first order
while the the I-C phase transition in the later is not weak. As the system
settles into the nematic phase, the decay of the single-particle second-rank
orientational OTCF follows a pattern that is similar to what is observed with
calamitic liquid crystals and supercooled molecular liquids.",2007-03-08T22:15:06Z
"Boundary quantum criticality in models of magnetic impurities coupled to
  bosonic baths","We investigate quantum impurity problems, where a local magnetic moment is
coupled to the spin density of a bosonic environment, leading to bosonic
versions of the standard Kondo and Anderson impurity models. In a physical
situation, these bosonic environments can correspond either to deconfined
spinons in certain classes of Z_2 frustrated antiferromagnets, or to particles
in a multicomponent Bose gase (in which case the spin degree of freedom is
attributed to hyperfine levels). Using renormalization group techniques, we
establish that our impurity models, which feature an exchange interaction
analogous to Kondo impurities in Fermi liquids, allow the flow towards a stable
strong-coupling state. Since the low-energy bosons live around a single point
in momentum space, and there is no Fermi surface, an impurity quantum phase
transition occurs at intermediate coupling, separating screened and unscreened
phases. This behavior is qualitatively different from previously studied
spin-isotropic variants of the spin-boson model, which display stable
intermediate-coupling fixed points and no screening.",2007-03-23T12:19:42Z
"Influence of Lorentz violation on Dirac quasinormal modes in the
  Schwarzschild black hole spacetime","Using the third-order WKB approximation and monodromy methods, we investigate
the influence of Lorentz violating coefficient $b$ (associated with a special
axial-vector $b_{\mu}$ field) on Dirac quasinormal modes in the Schwarzschild
black hole spacetime. At fundamental overtone, the real part decreases linearly
as the parameter $b$ increases. But the variation of the imaginary part with
$b$ becomes more complex. For the larger multiple moment $k$, the magnitude of
imaginary part increases with the increase of $b$, which means that presence of
Lorentz violation makes Dirac field damps more rapidly. At high overtones, it
is found that the real part of high-damped quasinormal frequency does not tend
to zero, which is quite a different from the symptotic Dirac quasinormal modes
without Lorentz violation.",2007-01-16T01:36:27Z
"Coupled Effects in Quantum Dot Nanostructures with Nonlinear Strain and
  Bridging Modelling Scales","We demonstrate that the conventional application of linear models to the
analysis of optoelectromechanical properties of nanostructures in bandstructure
engineering could be inadequate. The focus of the present paper is on a model
based on the coupled Schrodinger-Poisson system where we account consistently
for the piezoelectric effect and analyze the influence of different nonlinear
terms in strain components. The examples given in this paper show that the
piezoelectric effect contributions are essential and have to be accounted for
with fully coupled models. While in structural applications of piezoelectric
materials at larger scales, the minimization of the full electromechanical
energy is now a routine in many engineering applications, in bandstructure
engineering conventional approaches are still based on linear models with
minimization of uncoupled, purely elastic energy functionals with respect to
displacements. Generalizations of the existing models for bandstructure
calculations are presented in this paper in the context of coupled effects.",2007-02-25T14:45:31Z
"Full counting statistics of transport through two-channel Coulomb
  blockade systems","A mesoscopic Coulomb blockade system with two identical transport channels is
studied in terms of full counting statistics. It is found that the average
current cannot distinguish the quantum constructive interference from the
classical non-interference, but the shot noise and skewness are more sensitive
to the nature of quantum mechanical interference and can fulfill that task. The
interesting super-Poisson shot noise is found and is demonstrated as a
consequence of constructive interference, which induces an effective system
with fast-and-slow transport channels. Dephasing effects on the counting
statistics are carried out to display the continuous transition from quantum
interfering to non-interfering transports.",2007-03-28T06:53:10Z
Analytic Density of States in the Abrikosov-Gorkov Theory,"Since the early 1960s, Abrikosov-Gorkov theory has been used to describe
superconductors with paramagnetic impurities. Interestingly, the density of
states resulting from the theoretical framework has to date only been known
approximately, as a numeric solution of a complex polynomial. Here we introduce
an exact analytic solution for the density of states of a superconductor with
paramagnetic impurities. The solution is valid in the whole regime of
Abrikosov-Gorkov theory; both where there is an energy gap and gapless. While
of fundamental interest, we argue that this solution also has computational
benefits in the evaluation of integrals for tunneling conductances and allows
for an analytic description of materials with densities of states that are
modeled from the basic Abrikosov-Gorkov density of states.",2007-02-17T00:40:17Z
"Quantum Theory of Spontaneous Emission from Exciton-Electron-Phonon
  Complex in Solid: Quantum Interference and Many-Body Effect","A full quantum mechanical theory for the spontaneous emission from excitons
simultaneously coupled to electronic excitations and anharmonic phonons in
solid is developed. Origin of detailed structures, such as zero-phonon line
splitting, Fano lineshape near one phonon sideband, strong second-order phonon
Stokes line, asymmetric phonon anti-Stokes lines, and two-electron satellites
as well as their phonon replicas recently revealed in the low-temperature
photoluminescence of ZnO, has been identified by quantitative calculations from
the theory.",2007-02-23T11:06:33Z
"Resonantly enhanced tunneling of Bose-Einstein condensates in periodic
  potentials","We report on measurements of resonantly enhanced tunneling of Bose-Einstein

conditions of our system we were able to observe resonant tunneling in the
ground and the first two excited states of the lattice wells. We also
investigated the effect of the intrinsic nonlinearity of the condensate on the
tunneling resonances.",2007-02-23T15:32:42Z
Electronic structure of the electron-doped cuprate superconductors,"Within the framework of the kinetic energy driven d-wave superconductivity,
the electronic structure of the electron doped cuprate superconductors is
studied. It is shown that although there is an electron-hole asymmetry in the
phase diagram, the electronic structure of the electron-doped cuprates in the
superconducting-state is similar to that in the hole-doped case. With
increasing the electron doping, the spectral weight in the $(\pi,0)$ point
increases, while the position of the superconducting quasiparticle peak is
shifted towards the Fermi energy. In analogy to the hole-doped case, the
superconducting quasiparticles around the $(\pi,0)$ point disperse very weakly
with momentum.",2007-02-01T02:06:37Z
Enhanced Spin Dependent Shot Noise in Magnetic Tunnel Barriers,"We report the observation of enhanced spin dependent shot noise in magnetic
tunnel barriers, suggesting transport through localized states within the
barrier. This is supported by the existence of negative magnetoresistance and
structure in the differential conductance curves. A simple model of tunneling
through two interacting localized states with spin dependent tunneling rates is
used to explain our observations.",2007-01-18T20:57:27Z
Ground States of the SU(N) Heisenberg Model,"The SU(N) Heisenberg model with various single-row representations is
investigated by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. While the zero-temperature
phase boundary agrees qualitatively with the theoretical predictions based on
the 1/N expansion, some unexpected features are also observed. For N>=5 with
the fundamental representation, for example, it is suggested that the ground
states possess exact or approximate U(1) degeneracy. In addition, for the
representation of Young tableau with more than one column, the ground state
shows no valence-bond-solid order even at N greater than the threshold value.",2007-02-26T14:19:49Z
Non-abelian superconducting pumps,"Cooper pair pumping is a coherent process. We derive a general expression for
the adiabatic pumped charge in superconducting nanocircuits in the presence of
level degeneracy and relate it to non-Abelian holonomies of Wilczek and Zee. We
discuss an experimental system where the non-Abelian structure of the adiabatic
evolution manifests in the pumped charge.",2007-02-14T13:51:08Z
"Field-Driven Hysteresis of the d=3 Ising Spin Glass: Hard-Spin
  Mean-Field Theory","Hysteresis loops are obtained in the Ising spin-glass phase in d=3, using
frustration-conserving hard-spin mean-field theory. The system is driven by a
time-dependent random magnetic field H_Q that is conjugate to the spin-glass
order Q, yielding a field-driven first-order phase transition through the
spin-glass phase. The hysteresis loop area A of the Q-H_Q curve scales with
respect to the sweep rate h of magnetic field as A-A_0 = h^b. In the spin-glass
and random-bond ferromagnetic phases, the sweep-rate scaling exponent b changes
with temperature T, but appears not to change with antiferromagnetic bond
concentration p. By contrast, in the pure ferromagnetic phase, b does not
depend on T and has a sharply different value than in the two other phases.",2007-03-18T14:12:24Z
The Field Perturbation Theory of Pseudogaps in HTSC,"Here I establish the field perturbation theory of pseudogaps in HTSC. The
proposed ground state suggests an internal particle-hole field, which is normal
to nesting surfaces, and having twice the Fermi wave-number. It is proved that
the system violates momentum conservation by the wave-vector of this internal
field. This violation applies to the quasi-particle propagators, as well as to
the interactions. Interaction vertices via the Pauli matrix- are established.
This, in turn, establishes the validity of the pseudogap Hartree self-energy.",2007-01-17T12:01:04Z
"Entropy of entanglement and correlations induced by a quench: Dynamics
  of a quantum phase transition in the quantum Ising model","Quantum Ising model in one dimension is an exactly solvable example of a
quantum phase transition. We investigate its behavior during a quench from a
paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase caused by a gradual turning off of the
transverse field at a fixed rate characterized by the quench time $\tau_Q$. In
agreement with Kibble-Zurek mechanism, quantum state of the system after the
transition exhibits a characteristic correlation length $\hat\xi$ proportional
to the square root of the quench time $\tau_Q$. The inverse of this correlation
length determines average density of defects after the transition. In this
paper, we show that $\hat\xi$ also controls the entropy of entanglement of a
block of $L$ spins with the rest of the system. For large $L$, this entropy
saturates at $\frac16\log_2\hat\xi$, as might have been expected from the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Close to the critical point, the entropy saturates when
the block size $L\approx\hat\xi$, but -- in the subsequent evolution in the
ferromagnetic phase -- a somewhat larger length scale
$l=\sqrt{\tau_Q}\ln\tau_Q$ develops as a result of quantum dephasing, and the
entropy saturates when $L\approx l$. We also study the spin-spin correlation.
We find that close to the critical point ferromagnetic correlations decay
exponentially with the dynamical correlation length $\hat\xi$, but in the
following evolution this correlation function becomes oscillatory at distances
less than this scale. However, both the wavelength and the correlation length
of these oscillations are still determined by $\hat\xi$. We also derive
probability distribution for the number of kinks in a finite spin chain after
the transition.",2007-01-31T07:44:15Z
Statistical Cryptography using a Fisher-Schrödinger Model,"A principled procedure to infer a hierarchy of statistical distributions
possessing ill-conditioned eigenstructures, from incomplete constraints, is
presented. The inference process of the \textit{pdf}'s employs the Fisher
information as the measure of uncertainty, and, utilizes a semi-supervised
learning paradigm based on a measurement-response model. The principle
underlying the learning paradigm involves providing a quantum mechanical
connotation to statistical processes. The inferred \textit{pdf}'s constitute a
statistical host that facilitates the encryption/decryption of covert
information (code). A systematic strategy to encrypt/decrypt code via unitary
projections into the \textit{null spaces} of the ill-conditioned

the model.",2007-01-15T07:48:41Z
Dealing With Logical Omniscience: Expressiveness and Pragmatics,"We examine four approaches for dealing with the logical omniscience problem
and their potential applicability: the syntactic approach, awareness,
algorithmic knowledge, and impossible possible worlds. Although in some
settings these approaches are equi-expressive and can capture all epistemic
states, in other settings of interest (especially with probability in the
picture), we show that they are not equi-expressive. We then consider the
pragmatics of dealing with logical omniscience-- how to choose an approach and
construct an appropriate model.",2007-02-01T20:06:31Z
"Gravitational self force on a particle in circular orbit around a
  Schwarzschild black hole","We calculate the gravitational self force acting on a pointlike particle of
mass $\mu$, set in a circular geodesic orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole.
Our calculation is done in the Lorenz gauge: For given orbital radius, we first
solve directly for the Lorenz-gauge metric perturbation using numerical
evolution in the time domain; We then compute the (finite) back-reaction force
from each of the multipole modes of the perturbation; Finally, we apply the
``mode sum'' method to obtain the total, physical self force. The {\em
temporal} component of the self force (which is gauge invariant) describes the
dissipation of orbital energy through gravitational radiation. Our results for
this component are consistent, to within the computational accuracy, with the
total flux of gravitational-wave energy radiated to infinity and through the
event horizon. The {\em radial} component of the self force (which is gauge
dependent) is calculated here for the first time. It describes a conservative
shift in the orbital parameters away from their geodesic values. We thus obtain
the $O(\mu)$ correction to the specific energy and angular momentum parameters
(in the Lorenz gauge), as well as the $O(\mu)$ shift in the orbital frequency
(which is gauge invariant).",2007-01-15T16:19:48Z
"Intensity of Brillouin light scattering from spin waves in magnetic
  multilayers with noncollinear spin configurations: Theory and experiment","The scattering of photons from spin waves (Brillouin light scattering -- BLS)
is a well-established technique for the study of layered magnetic systems. The
information about the magnetic state and properties of the sample is contained
in the frequency position, width, and intensity of the BLS peaks. Previously
[Phys. Rev. B 67, 184404 (2003)], we have shown that spin wave frequencies can
be conveniently calculated within the ultrathin film approach, treating the
intralayer exchange as an effective bilinear interlayer coupling between thin
virtual sheets of the ferromagnetic layers. Here we give the consequent
extension of this approach to the calculation of the Brillouin light scattering
(BLS) peak intensities. Given the very close relation of the BLS cross-section
to the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), the depth-resolved longitudinal and
polar MOKE coefficients calculated numerically via the usual magneto-optic
formalism can be employed in combination with the spin wave precessional
amplitudes to calculate full BLS spectra for a given magnetic system. This
approach allows an easy calculation of BLS intensities even for noncollinear
spin configurations including the exchange modes. The formalism is applied to a
Fe/Cr/Fe/Ag/Fe trilayer system with one antiferromagnetically coupling spacer
(Cr). Good agreement with the experimental spectra is found for a wide variety
of spin configurations.",2007-02-01T16:02:46Z
"Lattice Boltzmann method for thermal flow simulation on standard
  lattices","The recently introduced consistent lattice Boltzmann model with energy
conservation [S. Ansumali, I.V. Karlin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 260605 (2005)] is
extended to the simulation of thermal flows on standard lattices. The
two-dimensional thermal model on the standard square lattice with nine
velocities is developed and validated in the thermal Couette and
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard natural convection problems.",2007-03-23T14:25:59Z
Stability of E' centers induced by 4.7eV laser radiation in SiO2,"The kinetics of E' centers (silicon dangling bonds) induced by 4.7eV pulsed
laser irradiation in dry fused silica was investigated by in situ optical
absorption spectroscopy. The stability of the defects, conditioned by reaction
with mobile hydrogen of radiolytic origin, is discussed and compared to results
of similar experiments performed on wet fused silica. A portion of E' and
hydrogen are most likely generated by laser-induced breaking of Si-H
precursors, while an additional fraction of the paramagnetic centers arise from
another formation mechanism. Both typologies of E' participate to the reaction
with H_2 leading to the post-irradiation decay of the defects. This annealing
process is slowed down on decreasing temperature and is frozen at T=200K,
consistently with the diffusion properties of H_2 in silica.",2007-03-02T14:07:25Z
"The Properties of Jovian Trojan Asteroids Listed in SDSS Moving Object
  Catalog 3","We analyze 1187 observations of about 860 unique candidate Jovian Trojan
asteroids listed in the 3rd release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Moving
Object Catalog. The sample is complete at the faint end to r=21.2 mag (apparent
brightness) and H=13.8 (absolute brightness, approximately corresponding to 10
km diameter). A subset of 297 detections of previously known Trojans were used
to design and optimize a selection method based on observed angular velocity
that resulted in the remaining objects. Using a sample of objects with known
orbits, we estimate that the candidate sample contamination is about 3%. The
well-controlled selection effects, the sample size, depth and accurate
five-band UV-IR photometry enabled several new findings and the placement of
older results on a firmer statistical footing. We find that there are
significantly more asteroids in the leading swarm (L4) than in the trailing
swarm (L5): N(L4)/N(L5)=1.6$\pm$0.1, independently of limiting object's size.
The overall counts normalization suggests that there are about as many Jovians
Trojans as there are main-belt asteroids down to the same size limit, in
agreement with earlier estimates. We find that Trojan asteroids have a
remarkably narrow color distribution (root-mean-scatter of only $\sim$0.05 mag)
that is significantly different from the color distribution of the main-belt
asteroids. The color of Trojan asteroids is correlated with their orbital
inclination, in a similar way for both swarms, but appears uncorrelated with
the object's size. We extrapolate the results presented here and estimate that
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will determine orbits, accurate colors and
measure light curves in six photometric bandpasses for about 100,000 Jovian
Trojan asteroids.",2007-03-01T18:54:28Z
"Computational approach to finite size and shape effects in iron
  nanomagnets","We develop and validate a computational approach to nanomagnets. It is built
on the spin wave approximation to a Heisenberg ferromagnet whose parameters can
be calculated from a first principles theory (e.g. density functional theory).
The method can be used for high throughput analysis of a variety of
nanomagnetic materials. We compute the dependence of the magnetization of an
iron nanomagnet on temperature, size and shape. The approach is applied to
nanomagnets in the range of 432 atoms to 59 million atoms, a size which is
several orders of magnitude beyond the scalability of density functional
theory.",2007-01-10T21:33:51Z
"Average energy and fluctuations of a granular gas in the threshold of
  the clustering instability","The behavior of an isolated dilute granular gas near the threshold of its
clustering instability is investigated by means of fluctuating hydrodynamics
and the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The theoretical predictions from
the former are shown to be in good agreement with the simulation results. The
total energy of the the system is renormalized by the fluctuations of the
vorticity field. Moreover, the scaled second moment of the energy fluctuations
exhibits a power-law divergent behavior",2007-01-11T16:14:36Z

Photonic Band Gap in the Triangular Lattice of BEC vortices,"We investigate the photonic bands of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate with
a triangular vortex lattice. Index contrast between the vortex cores and the
bulk of the condensate is achieved through the enhancement of the index via
atomic coherence. Frequency dependent dielectric function is used in the
calculations of the bands, resulting in photonic band gap widths of a few MHz.",2007-03-29T10:57:00Z
"Emergence of a negative charging energy in a metallic dot capacitively
  coupled to a superconducting island","We consider the hybrid setup formed by a metallic dot, capacitively coupled
to a superconducting island S connected to a bulk superconductor by a Josephson
junction. Charge fluctuations in S act as a dynamical gate and overscreen the
electronic repulsion in the metallic dot, producing an attractive interaction
between two additional electrons. As the offset charge of the metallic dot is
increased, the dot charging curve shows positive steps ($+2e$) followed by
negative ones ($-e$) signaling the occurrence of a negative differential
capacitance. A proposal for experimental detection is given, and potential
applications in nanoelectronics are mentioned.",2007-03-15T14:32:20Z
Current-induced magnetic vortex core switching in a Permalloy nanodisk,"We report on the switching of a magnetic vortex core in a sub-micron
Permalloy disk, induced by a short current pulse applied in the film plane.
Micromagnetic simulations including the adiabatic and non-adiabatic spin-torque
terms are used to investigate the current-driven magnetization dynamics. We
predict that a core reversal can be triggered by current bursts a tenth of a
nanosecond long. The vortex core reversal process is found to be the same as
when an external field pulse is applied. The control of a vortex core's
orientation using current pulses introduces the technologically relevant
possibility to address individual nanomagnets within dense arrays.",2007-02-02T16:52:34Z
"On the possibility that STS ""gap-maps"" of cuprate single crystals are
  dominated by k-space anisotropy and not by nano-scale inhomogeneity","The results of a computer analysis of a simple 2D quantum mechanical
tunnelling model are reported. These suggest that the spatial dependence of the
superconducting energy gap observed by Scanning Tunnelling Spectroscopy (STS)
studies of single crystals of the high Tc superconductor Bi:2212 is not
necessarily caused by nanoscale inhomogeneity. Instead the spatial dependence
of the STS data could arise from the momentum (k) dependence of the energy gap,
which is a defining feature of a d-wave superconductor. It is possible that
this viewpoint could be exploited to obtain k-dependent information from STS
studies.",2007-01-26T18:37:07Z
Coulomb Blockade and Super Universality of the Theta-Angle,"Based on the Ambegaokar-Eckern-Schon approach to the Coulomb blockade we
develop a complete quantum theory of the single electron transistor. We
identify a previously unrecognized physical observable q^\prime in the problem
that, unlike the usual average charge (Q) on the island, is robustly quantized
for any finite value of the tunneling conductance as the temperature goes to
absolute zero. This novel quantity is fundamentally related to the
non-symmetrized noise of the system. We present a unifying scaling diagram in
the q^\prime - g^\prime plane where g^\prime denotes the conductance of the
system. The results display all the super universal topological features of the
theta-angle concept that previously arose in the theory of the quantum Hall
effect.",2007-02-16T18:30:52Z
Automatic Annotation of XHTML Pages with Audio Components,"In this paper we present Deiush, a multimodal system for browsing hypertext

automatically annotate hypertext Web documents (i.e. XHTML pages) with
browsable audio components. It combines two key technologies: (1) middleware
automatic separation of Web documents through structural and semantic analysis
which is annotated with audio components, transforming them into XHTML+VoiceXML
format to represent multimodal dialog; and (2) Opera Browser, an already
standardized browser which we adopt as an interface of the XHTML+VoiceXML

"Metal clusters, quantum dots and trapped atoms -- from single-particle

on the nanoscale. After a few general remarks on the many-particle physics of
the harmonic oscillator -- likely being the most studied example for the
many-body systems of finite quantal systems, we discuss properties of metal
clusters, quantum dots and cold atoms in traps. We address magic numbers, shape

Spin-polarized Fermi superfluids as Bose-Fermi mixtures,"In the strong-coupling BEC region where a Feshbach resonance gives rise to
tightly-bound dimer molecules, we show that a spin-polarized Fermi superfluid
reduces to a simple Bose-Fermi mixture of Bose-condensed dimers and the
leftover unpaired fermions. Using a many-body functional integral formalism,
the Gaussian fluctuations give rise to an induced dimer-dimer interaction
mediated by the unpaired fermions, with the dimer-fermion vertex being given by
the (mean-field) Born approximation. Treating the pairing fluctuations to
quartic order, we show how the action for a spin-polarized Fermi superfluid
reduces to one for a Bose-Fermi mixture. This Bose-Fermi action includes an
expression for the effective dimer-unpaired fermion interaction in a
spin-polarized Fermi superfluid beyond the Born approximation, in the
superfluid phase at finite temperatures. In the low-density limit, we show how
this dimer-fermion interaction gives the s-wave scattering length
$a_{BF}=1.18a_F$ ($a_F$ is the s-wave fermion scattering length), a result
first derived by Skorniakov and Ter-Martirosian in 1957 for three interacting
fermions.",2007-03-16T19:43:34Z
Disorder Enhanced Spin Polarization in Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors,"We present a theoretical study of diluted magnetic semiconductors that
includes spin-orbit coupling within a realistic host band structure and treats
explicitly the effects of disorder due to randomly substituted Mn ions. While
spin-orbit coupling reduces the spin polarization by mixing different spin
states in the valence bands, we find that disorder from Mn ions enhances the
spin polarization due to formation of ferromagnetic impurity clusters and
impurity bound states. The disorder leads to large effects on the hole carriers
which form impurity bands as well as hybridizing with the valence band. For Mn
doping 0.01 < x < 0.04, the system is metallic with a large effective mass and
low mobility.",2007-02-24T06:37:56Z
Surface-plasmon polaritons in a lattice of metal cylinders,"Plasmon modes of a two-dimensional lattice of long conducting circular wires
are investigated by using an embedding technique to solve Maxwell's equations
rigorously. The frequency-dependent density of states is calculated for various
values of the wave vector and the filling fraction. At low filling fractions,
collective modes are all found to accumulate at the surface-plasmon frequency
$\omega_p/\sqrt{2}$, $\omega_p$ being the bulk plasmon frequency. As the
filling fraction increases, the interference between the electromagnetic fields
generated by localized surface-plasmon polaritons leads to the presence of {\it
new} resonances, whose frequency strongly depends on the interparticle
separation. For touching wires, a number of multipole resonances fill the
spectral range between dipole resonances, as occurs in the case of a
three-dimensional packing of metal spheres.",2007-03-26T09:14:02Z
"Electronic Correlations in CoO2, the Parent Compound of Triangular
  Cobaltates","A 59Co NMR study of CoO2, the x=0 end member of AxCoO2 (A = Na, Li...)
cobaltates, reveals a metallic ground state, though with clear signs of strong
electron correlations: low-energy spin fluctuations develop at wave vectors q
different from 0 and a crossover to a Fermi-liquid regime occurs below a
characteristic temperature T*~7 K. Despite some uncertainty over the exact
cobalt oxidation state n this material, the results show that electronic
correlations are revealed as x is reduced below 0.3. The data are consistent
with NaxCoO2 being close to the Mott transition in the x -> 0 limit.",2007-01-24T12:59:39Z
Deciding k-colourability of $P_5$-free graphs in polynomial time,"The problem of computing the chromatic number of a $P_5$-free graph is known
to be NP-hard. In contrast to this negative result, we show that determining
whether or not a $P_5$-free graph admits a $k$-colouring, for each fixed number
of colours $k$, can be done in polynomial time. If such a colouring exists, our
algorithm produces it.",2007-02-07T15:29:32Z
Interference of Degenerate Polariton Condensates in Microcavities,"We demonstrate theoretically that the interaction of two degenerate
condensates of exciton-polaritons in microcavities leads to polarization
dependent parametric oscillations. The resonant polariton-polariton scattering
is governed by the polarization of the condensates and can be fully suppressed
for certain polarizations. A polarization controlled solid state optical gate
is proposed.",2007-03-26T12:54:47Z
Permanent polarization of small metallic particles,"Electric charge density in a metallic nanoparticle fluctuates due to
inhomogeneities of various kinds. While in the bulk these fluctuations are
compensated via Thomas--Fermi screening, residual surface charges give rise to
a permanent electric dipole moment. We show that this dipole moment increases
linearly with particle size, and fluctuates strongly from particle to particle",2007-02-22T19:58:38Z
Multivariate Generalizations of the q--Central Limit Theorem,"We study multivariate generalizations of the $q$-central limit theorem, a
generalization of the classical central limit theorem consistent with
nonextensive statistical mechanics. Two types of generalizations are addressed,
more precisely the {\it direct} and {\it sequential} $q$-central limit theorems
are proved. Their relevance to the asymptotic scale invariance of some
specially correlated systems is studied. A $q$-analog of the classic weak
convergence is introduced and its equivalence to the $q$-convergence is proved
for $q>1$.",2007-03-20T21:41:30Z
"Fluctuation theorem for counting-statistics in electron transport
  through quantum junctions","We demonstrate that the probability distribution of the net number of
electrons passing through a quantum system in a junction obeys a steady-state
fluctuation theorem (FT) which can be tested experimentally by the full
counting statistics (FCS) of electrons crossing the lead-system interface. The
FCS is calculated using a many-body quantum master equation (QME) combined with
a Liouville space generating function (GF) formalism. For a model of two
coupled quantum dots, we show that the FT becomes valid for long binning times
and provide an estimate for the finite-time deviations. We also demonstrate
that the Mandel (or Fano) parameter associated with the incoming or outgoing
electron transfers show subpoissonian (antibunching) statistics.",2007-02-16T00:40:25Z
Electrodynamics near the Metal-to-Insulator Transition in V3O5,"The electrodynamics near the metal-to-insulator transitions (MIT) induced, in
V3O5 single crystals, by both temperature (T) and pressure (P) has been studied
by infrared spectroscopy. The T- and P-dependence of the optical conductivity
may be explained within a polaronic scenario. The insulating phase at ambient T
and P corresponds to strongly localized small polarons. Meanwhile the T-induced
metallic phase at ambient pressure is related to a liquid of polarons showing
incoherent dc transport, in the P-induced metallic phase at room T strongly
localized polarons coexist with partially delocalized ones. The electronic
spectral weight is almost recovered, in both the T and P induced metallization
processes, on an energy scale of 1 eV, thus supporting the key-role of
electron-lattice interaction in the V3O5 metal-to-insulator transition.",2007-01-30T11:19:24Z

"Synthesis and characterization of core-shell structure silica-coated
  Fe29.5Ni70.5 nanoparticles","In view of potential applications of magnetic particles in biomedicine and
electromagnetic devices, we made use of the classical Stober method
base-catalysed hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) to
encapsulate FeNi nanoparticles within a silica shell. An original stirring
system under high power ultrasounds made possible to disperse the otherwise
agglomerated particles. Sonication guaranteed particles to remain dispersed
during the Stober synthesis and also improved the efficiency of the method. The
coated particles are characterized by electron microscopy (TEM) and
spectroscopy (EDX) showing a core-shell structure with a uniform layer of
silica. Silica-coating does not affect the core magnetic properties. Indeed,
all samples are ferromagnetic at 77 K and room temperature and the Curie point
remains unchanged. Only the coercive force shows an unexpected non-monotonous
dependence on silica layer thickness.",2007-03-19T13:55:31Z
HUDF 1619 - a candidate polar-ring galaxy in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field,"A good candidate for a polar-ring galaxy has been detected in the Hubble
Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). The galaxy HUDF 1619 (V~25 mag, z~1) is the most
distant object of this type known to date. A large-scale structure crosses the
highly warped disk of the main galaxy seen almost edge-on at an angle of about
70 grad. The luminosity of this structure (the possible polar ring) reaches
\~1/3 of the luminosity of the central galaxy. A strong absorption lane is seen
in the region where this structure is projected onto the disk of the central
object. There are two galaxies of comparable luminosity adjacent to HUDF 1619

gave rise to the ring structure.",2007-03-30T07:40:26Z

Damage Spreading and Criticality in Finite Random Dynamical Networks,"We systematically study and compare damage spreading at the sparse
percolation (SP) limit for random boolean and threshold networks with
perturbations that are independent of the network size $N$. This limit is
relevant to information and damage propagation in many technological and
natural networks. Using finite size scaling, we identify a new characteristic
connectivity $K_s$, at which the average number of damaged nodes $\bar d$,
after a large number of dynamical updates, is independent of $N$. Based on
marginal damage spreading, we determine the critical connectivity
$K_c^{sparse}(N)$ for finite $N$ at the SP limit and show that it
systematically deviates from $K_c$, established by the annealed approximation,
even for large system sizes. Our findings can potentially explain the results
recently obtained for gene regulatory networks and have important implications
for the evolution of dynamical networks that solve specific computational or
functional tasks.",2007-01-24T17:44:57Z

Persistence and survival in equilibrium step fluctuations,"Results of analytic and numerical investigations of first-passage properties
of equilibrium fluctuations of monatomic steps on a vicinal surface are

well as the probability of persistent large deviations are considered. Results
of experiments in which dynamical scanning tunneling microscopy is used to
evaluate these first-passage properties for steps with different microscopic
mechanisms of mass transport are also presented and interpreted in terms of
theoretical predictions for appropriate models. Effects of discrete sampling,

Physics Models of Earthquake,"Since long back, scientists have been putting enormous effort to understand
earthquake dynamics -the goal is to develop a successful prediction scheme
which can provide reliable alarm that an earthquake is imminent. Model studies
sometimes help to understand in some extend the basic dynamics of the real

report, we review several physics models which capture some essential features
of earthquake phenomenon and also suggest methods to predict catastrophic
events being within the range of model parameters.",2007-01-10T14:36:32Z
"Stability of Biaxial Nematic Phase for Systems with Variable Molecular
  Shape Anisotropy","We study the influence of fluctuations in molecular shape on the stability of
the biaxial nematic phase by generalizing the mean field model of Mulder and
Ruijgrok [Physica A {\bf 113}, 145 (1982)]. We limit ourselves to the case when
the molecular shape anisotropy, represented by the alignment tensor, is a
random variable of an annealed type. A prototype of such behavior can be found
in lyotropic systems - a mixture of potassium laurate, 1-decanol, and $D_2O$,
where distribution of the micellar shape adjusts to actual equilibrium
conditions. Further examples of materials with the biaxial nematic phase, where
molecular shape is subject to fluctuations, are thermotropic materials composed
of flexible trimeric- or tetrapod-like molecular units. Our calculations show
that the Gaussian equilibrium distribution of the variables describing
molecular shape (dispersion force) anisotropy gives rise to new classes of the
phase diagrams, absent in the original model. Depending on properties of the
shape fluctuations, the stability of the biaxial nematic phase can be either
enhanced or depressed, relative to the uniaxial nematic phases. In the former
case the splitting of the Landau point into two triple points with a direct
phase transition line from isotropic to biaxial phase is observed.",2007-03-28T14:16:11Z
Uniform plasma oscillations in ellipsoid of conductive material,"The influence of the shape of a sample on the type of uniform dipole
collective electrons oscillations is discussed. In samples of a bulk shape
uniform bulk dipole oscillation (Langmuir oscillation) cannot exist. It exists
in samples of a thin slab shape only. As uniform bulk dipole oscillations
cannot penetrate ellipsoidal samples of conductive material, they exist in the
surface layer of a sample only (Mie oscillations). Frequencies of Mie
oscillations are alculated for a sample of the shape of an arbitrary ellipsoid.",2007-02-04T20:54:13Z
"Long-range coupling and scalable architecture for superconducting flux
  qubits","Constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer is a daunting task. Given any
design, it is possible to determine the maximum error rate of each type of
component that can be tolerated while still permitting arbitrarily large-scale
quantum computation. It is an underappreciated fact that including an
appropriately designed mechanism enabling long-range qubit coupling or
transport substantially increases the maximum tolerable error rates of all
components. With this thought in mind, we take the superconducting flux qubit
coupling mechanism described in PRB 70, 140501 (2004) and extend it to allow
approximately 500 MHz coupling of square flux qubits, 50 um a side, at a
distance of up to several mm. This mechanism is then used as the basis of two
scalable architectures for flux qubits taking into account crosstalk and
fault-tolerant considerations such as permitting a universal set of logical
gates, parallelism, measurement and initialization, and data mobility.",2007-02-26T21:49:28Z
Excited Thomas-Efimov levels in ultracold gases,"Since the early days of quantum physics, the complex behavior of three
interacting particles has been the subject of numerous experimental and
theoretical studies. In a recent Letter to Nature, Kraemer et al. [Nature
(London) 440, 315 (2006)] report on experimental ``evidence for Efimov quantum
states'' in an ultracold gas of cesium atoms. Such quantum states refer to an
infinite series of energy levels of three identical Bose particles,
accumulating at the threshold for dissociation as the scattering length of each
pair is tuned to infinity. Whereas the existence of a single Efimov state has
been predicted for three helium atoms, earlier experimental studies concluded
that this elusive state had not been found. In this paper we show by an
intuitive argument and full numerical calculations that the helium and cesium
experiments actually provide evidence of the same, ground state of this trimer
spectrum, which the helium experimentalists and pioneering theoretical studies
had not associated with Efimov's effect. Unlike the helium trimer, the observed
133Cs_3 resonance refers to a Borromean molecular state. We discuss how as yet
unobserved, excited Efimov quantum states might be detected in ultracold gases
of 85Rb and of 133Cs at magnetic field strengths in the vicinity of 0.08 T (800
G).",2007-02-07T15:36:02Z
"Soliton Wall Superlattice in Quasi-One-Dimensional Conductor
  (Per)2Pt(mnt)2","We suggest a model to explain the appearance of a high resistance high
magnetic field charge-density-wave (CDW) phase, discovered by D. Graf et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. v. 93, 076406 (2004)] in (Per)2Pt(mnt)2. In particular, we
show that the Pauli spin-splitting effects improve the nesting properties of a
realistic quasi-one-dimensional electron spectrum and, therefore, a high
resistance Peierls CDW phase is stabilized in high magnetic fields. In low and
very high magnetic fields, a periodic soliton wall superlattice (SWS) phase is
found to be a ground state. We suggest experimental studies of the predicted
phase transitions between the Peierls and SWS CDW phases in (Per)2Pt(mnt)2 to
discover a unique SWS phase.",2007-02-21T17:31:26Z
"The Michigan/MIKE Fiber System Survey of Stellar Radial Velocities in
  Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies: Acquisition and Reduction of Data","We introduce a stellar velocity survey of dwarf spheroidal galaxies,
undertaken using the Michigan/MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) at the Magellan/Clay 6.5
m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. As of 2006 November we have used MMFS
to collect 6415 high-resolution (R= 20000-25000) spectra from 5180 stars in
four dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Carina, Fornax, Sculptor and Sextans. Spectra
sample the range 5140-5180 Angstroms, which includes the prominent magnesium
triplet absorption feature. We measure radial velocity (RV) to a median
precision of 2.0 km/s for stars as faint as V ~ 20.5. From the spectra we also
are able to measure the strength of iron and magnesium absorption features
using spectral indices that correlate with effective temperature, surface
gravity and chemical abundance. Measurement of line strength allows us to
identify interloping foreground stars independently of velocity, and to examine
the metallicity distribution among dSph members. Here we present detailed
descriptions of MMFS, our target selection and spectroscopic observations, the
data reduction procedure, and error analysis. We compare our RV results to
previously published measurements for individual stars. In some cases we find
evidence for a mild, velocity-dependent offset between the RVs we measure using
the magnesium triplet and previously published RV measurements derived from the
infrared calcium triplet. In companion papers we will present the complete data
sets and kinematic analyses of these new observations.",2007-03-12T20:36:03Z
Electromagnetic Fields in Jets,"The magnetic fields and energy flows in an astronomical jet described by our
earlier model are calculated in detail. Though the field distribution varies
with the external pressure function p(z), it depends only weakly on the other
boundary conditions. Individual fieldlines were plotted; the lines become
nearly vertical at the bottom and are twisted at the top. An animation of a
fieldline's motion was made, which shows the line being wound up by the
accretion disc's differential rotation and rising as a result of this. The
distribution of Poynting flux within the jet indicates that much of the energy
flows up the jet from the inside of the accretion disc but a substantial
fraction flows back down to the outside.",2007-03-30T13:24:37Z
From Luttinger to Fermi liquids in organic conductors,"This chapter reviews the effects of interactions in quasi-one dimensional
systems, such as the Bechgaard and Fabre salts, and in particular the Luttinger
liquid physics. It discusses in details how transport measurements both d.c.
and a.c. allow to probe such a physics. It also examine the dimensional
crossover and deconfinement transition occurring between the one dimensional
case and the higher dimensional one resulting from the hopping of electrons
between chains in the quasi-one dimensional structure.",2007-02-24T02:20:39Z
Thermodynamic Entropy and Chaos in a Discrete Hydrodynamical System,"We show that the thermodynamic entropy density is proportional to the largest
Lyapunov ex- ponent (LLE) of a discrete hydrodynamical system, a deterministic
two-dimensional lattice gas automaton. The definition of the LLE for cellular
automata is based on the concept of Boolean derivatives and is formally
equivalent to that of continuous dynamical systems. This relation is jus-
tified using a Markovian model. In an irreversible process with an initial
density difference between both halves of the system, we find that Boltzmann's
H function is linearly related to the expansion factor of the LLE, although the
latter is more sensitive to the presence of traveling waves.",2007-02-04T10:45:26Z
"Thermo-kinetic approach of single-particles and clusters involving
  anomalous diffusion under viscoelastic response","We present a thermo-kinetic description of anomalous diffusion of
single-particles and clusters in a viscoelastic medium in terms of a
non-Markovian diffusion equation involving memory functions. The scaling
behaviour of these functions is analyzed by considering hydrodynamics and
cluster-size space random walk arguments. We explain experimental results on
diffusion of Brownian particles in the cytoskeleton, in cluster-cluster
aggregation and in a suspension of micelles.",2007-01-22T13:35:07Z
"Neutron-rich gamma-ray burst flows: dynamics and particle creation in
  neutron - proton collisions","We consider gamma-ray burst outflows with a substantial neutron component
that are either dominated by thermal energy (fireballs) or by magnetic energy.
In the latter case, we focus on the recently introduced `AC' model which relies
on magnetic reconnection to accelerate the flow and power the prompt emission.
For both the fireball and the AC model, we investigate the dynamical importance
of neutrons on the outflow. We study particle creation in inelastic neutron -
proton collisions and find that in both models the resulting neutrino emission
is too weak to be detectable. The inelastic collisions also produce gamma-rays,
which create pairs in interactions with soft photons carried with the flow. In
magnetically driven outflows, the energy of these pairs is radiated away as
synchrotron emission. The bulk of the emission takes place at a few hundred
keV, which makes it difficult to disentangle this signal from the prompt
emission. In fireballs, however, pair cascading leads to the emission of
gamma-rays with observer energy in the range of 2 - 20 GeV and a fluence well
above the GLAST threshold. Therefore this emission can be a useful diagnostic
of the nature of the outflow.",2007-03-28T11:32:30Z
"Search for Continuous Gravitational Waves: simple criterion for optimal
  detector networks","We derive a simple algebraic criterion to select the optimal detector network
for a coherent wide parameter-space (all-sky) search for continuous
gravitational waves. Optimality in this context is defined as providing the
highest (average) sensitivity per computing cost. This criterion is a direct
consequence of the properties of the multi-detector F-statistic metric, which
has been derived recently. Interestingly, the choice of the optimal network
only depends on the noise-levels and duty-cycles of the respective detectors,
and not on the available computing power.",2007-02-12T12:46:22Z
Charge-stripe order in the electronic ferroelectric LuFe2O4,"The structural features of the charge ordering states in LuFe2O4 are
characterized by in-situ cooling TEM observations from 300K down to 20K. Two
distinctive structural modulations, a major q1= (1/3, 1/3, 2) and a weak
q2=q1/10 + (0, 0, 3/2), have been well determined at the temperature of 20K.
Systematic analysis demonstrates that the charges at low temperatures are well
crystallized in a charge stripe phase, in which the charge density wave
behaviors in a non-sinusoidal fashion resulting in elemental electric dipoles
for ferroelectricity. It is also noted that the charge ordering and
ferroelectric domains often change markedly with lowering temperatures and
yields a rich variety of structural phenomena.",2007-02-26T09:23:39Z
"Generation of Efficient Codes for Realizing Boolean Functions in
  Nanotechnologies","We address the challenge of implementing reliable computation of Boolean
functions in future nanocircuit fabrics. Such fabrics are projected to have
very high defect rates. We overcome this limitation by using a combination of
cheap but unreliable nanodevices and reliable but expensive CMOS devices. In
our approach, defect tolerance is achieved through a novel coding of Boolean
functions; specifically, we exploit the dont cares of Boolean functions
encountered in multi-level Boolean logic networks for constructing better
codes. We show that compared to direct application of existing coding
techniques, the coding overhead in terms of extra bits can be reduced, on
average by 23%, and savings can go up to 34%. We demonstrate that by
incorporating efficient coding techniques more than a 40% average yield
improvement is possible in case of 1% and 0.1% defect rates. With 0.1% defect
density, the savings can be up to 90%.",2007-03-21T21:30:25Z
"Coherent state path integral and super-symmetry for condensates composed
  of bosonic and fermionic atoms","A super-symmetric coherent state path integral on the Keldysh time contour is
considered for bosonic and fermionic atoms which interact among each other with
a common short-ranged two-body potential. We investigate the symmetries of
Bose-Einstein condensation for the equivalent bosonic and fermionic
constituents and specialize on the examination of super-symmetries for pair
condensate terms. A Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation from 'Nambu'-doubled
super-fields leads to a generating function with super-matrices for the
self-energy whose manifold is given by the ortho-symplectic super-group
Osp(S,S|2L). Effective equations are derived for anomalous terms which are
related to the molecular- and BCS- condensate pairs. A change of integration
measure for the coset decomposition Osp(S,S|2L)/U(L|S)xU(L|S) is performed,
including a separation of density and anomalous parts of the self-energy with a
gradient expansion for the Goldstone modes. The independent anomalous fields in
the actions can be transformed by the inverse square root of the metric tensor
of Osp(S,S|2L)/U(L|S) so that the coset integration measure with the
super-Jacobi-determinant can be removed from the coherent state path integral
and Gaussian-like integrations remain. The variations of the independent coset
fields in the effective actions result in classical field equations for a
nonlinear sigma model with the anomalous terms.",2007-02-08T20:45:41Z
Static and dynamic properties of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model,"The spinless Falicov-Kimball model is studied by the use of a recently
developed projector-based renormalization method (PRM) for many-particle
Hamiltonians. The method is used to evaluate static and dynamic quantities of
the one-dimensional model at half-filling. To these belong the quasiparticle
excitation energy $\tilde{\epsilon}_k$ and the momentum distribution $n_k$ of
the conduction electrons and spatial correlation functions of the localized
electrons. One of the most remarkable results is the appearance of a gap in
$\tilde{\epsilon}_k$ at the Fermi level of the order of the Coulomb repulsion
$U$, which is accompanied by a smooth behavior for $n_k$. The density of states
for the conduction electrons and the one-particle spectral functions for the
localized electrons are also discussed. In both quantities a gap opens with
increasing $U$.",2007-01-18T08:34:17Z
"Current-Induced Magnetic Domain-Wall Motion by Spin Transfer Torque:
  Collective Coordinate Approach with Domain-Wall Width Variation","The spin transfer torque generated by a spin-polarized current can induce the
shift of the magnetic domain-wall position. In this work, we study
theoretically the current-induced domain-wall motion by using the collective
coordinate approach [Gen Tatara and Hiroshi Kohno, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 86601
(2004)]. The approach is extended to include not only the domain-wall position
and the polarization angle changes but also the domain-wall width variation. It
is demonstrated that the width variation affects the critical current.",2007-03-22T05:54:42Z
"Numerical Model For Vibration Damping Resulting From the First Order
  Phase Transformations","A numerical model is constructed for modelling macroscale damping effects
induced by the first order martensite phase transformations in a shape memory
alloy rod. The model is constructed on the basis of the modified
Landau-Ginzburg theory that couples nonlinear mechanical and thermal fields.
The free energy function for the model is constructed as a double well function
at low temperature, such that the external energy can be absorbed during the
phase transformation and converted into thermal form. The Chebyshev spectral
methods are employed together with backward differentiation for the numerical
analysis of the problem. Computational experiments performed for different
vibration energies demonstrate the importance of taking into account damping
effects induced by phase transformations.",2007-02-28T18:31:19Z
"Ground-state path integral Monte Carlo simulations of positive ions in
  $^4$He clusters: bubbles or snowballs?","The local order around alkali (Li$^+$ and Na$^+$) and alkaline-eath (Be$^+$,
Mg$^+$ and Ca$^+$) ions in $^4$He clusters has been studied using ground-state
path integral Monte Carlo calculations. We apply a criterion based on multipole
dynamical correlations to discriminate between solid-like versus liquid-like
behavior of the $^4$He shells coating the ions. As it was earlier suggested by
experimental measurements in bulk $^4$He, our findings indicate that Be$^+$
produces a solid-like (""snowball"") structure, similarly to alkali ions and in
contrast to the more liquid-like $^4$He structure embedding heavier
alkaline-earth ions.",2007-01-10T17:27:53Z
NACO-SDI direct imaging search for the exoplanet Eps Eri b,"The active K2V star $\epsilon$ Eri hosts the most nearby known extrasolar
planet. With an angular separation of about 1"" on average, and an age of a few
to several hundred Myrs, $\epsilon$ Eri b is one of the prime candidates for
becoming the first definitive extrasolar planet imaged directly. We present a
multi-epoch deep differential imaging survey performed with NACO-SDI at the VLT
with the aim of finding the planet. The results are combined with recent
astrometry in an attempt to further constrain the detection limits. No
convincing candidate is found among the many coherent structures that
constitute the residual speckle noise, which is the dominant noise at small
angular scales. We present our detection limits, compare them with the
estimated brightness of $\epsilon$ Eri b, and analyze how the limits can be
improved further. It is found that integration time remains a very important
parameter for achieving good results, even in the speckle-dominated regimes.
The results yield new, improved upper 3$\sigma$ limits on the absolute H-band
(1.6 $\mu$m) brightness of the 1.55 $M_{\rm jup}$ companion of 19.1 to 19.5
mag, depending on the specific age of the system.",2007-03-13T09:09:41Z
Statistical Mechanics of Semiflexible Bundles of Wormlike Polymer Chains,"We demonstrate that a semiflexible bundle of wormlike chains exhibits a
state-dependent bending stiffness that alters fundamentally its scaling
behavior with respect to the standard wormlike chain. We explore the
equilibrium conformational and mechanical behavior of wormlike bundles in
isolation, in crosslinked networks, and in solution.",2007-02-05T11:05:30Z
"Outgassing, Temperature Gradients and the Radiometer Effect in LISA: A
  Torsion Pendulum Investigation","Thermal modeling of the LISA gravitational reference sensor (GRS) includes
such effects as outgassing from the proof mass and its housing and the
radiometer effect. Experimental data in conditions emulating the LISA GRS are
required to confidently predict the GRS performance. Outgassing and the
radiometer effect are similar in characteristics and are difficult to decouple
experimentally.
  The design of our torsion balance allows us to investigate differential
radiation pressure, the radiometer effect, and outgassing on closely separated
conducting surfaces with high sensitivity. A thermally controlled split copper
plate is brought near a freely hanging plate-torsion pendulum.We have varied
the temperature on each half of the copper plate and have measured the
resulting forces on the pendulum.
  We have determined that to first order the current GRS model for the
radiometer effect, outgassing, and radiation pressure are mostly consistent
with our torsion balance measurements and therefore these thermal effects do
not appear to be a large hindrance to the LISA noise budget. However, there
remain discrepancies between the predicted dependence of these effects on the
temperature of our apparatus.",2007-02-08T20:15:45Z
Analysis of Rotation Curves in the framework of R^n gravity,"We present an analysis of a devised sample of Rotation Curves (RCs), aimed at
checking the consequences of a modified f(R) gravity on galactic scales.
Originally motivated by the the dark energy mystery, this theory may serve as a
possibility of explaining the observed non-Keplerian profiles of galactic RCs
in terms of a break-down of the Einstein General Relativity. We show that in
general the power-law f(R) version could fit well the observations with
reasonable values for the mass model parameters, encouraging further
investigation on R^n gravity from both observational and theoretical points of
view.",2007-03-10T18:58:16Z
Optical Control of Topological Quantum Transport in Semiconductors,"Intense coherent laser radiation red-detuned from absorption edge can
reactively activate sizable Hall type charge and spin transport in n-doped
paramagnetic semiconductors as a consequence of k-space Berry curvature
transferred from valence band to photon-dressed conduction band. In the
presence of disorder, the optically induced Hall conductance can change sign
with laser intensity.",2007-02-15T20:37:28Z
On the absence of the glass transition in two dimensional hard disks,"In this paper we study the glass transition in a model of identical hard
spheres, focusing on the two dimensional case. In the mean-field limit the
model exhibits an ideal glass transition of the same nature of that found in
discontinuous spin glasses. Nevertheless, a systematic expansion around the
mean-field solution seems to indicate that the glass transitions is smeared out
in two dimensions, in agreement with some recent results. Our investigation
could be generalized to higher spatial dimensions, providing a way to determine
the lower critical dimensionality of the mean-field ideal glass picture.",2007-01-05T10:57:03Z
Suzaku Observations of the Soft X-ray Background,"We have analyzed a pair of Suzaku XIS1 spectra of the soft X-ray background,
obtained by observing towards and to the side of a nearby (d = 230 pc)
absorbing filament in the southern Galactic hemisphere. We fit multicomponent
spectral models to the spectra in order to separate the foreground emission due
to the Local Bubble (LB) from the background emission due to the Galactic halo
and unresolved AGN.
  We obtain LB and halo parameters that are different from those obtained from
our analysis of XMM-Newton spectra from these same directions. The LB
temperature is lower (log T = 5.93 versus 6.06), and the flux due to the LB in
the Suzaku band is an order of magnitude less than is expected from our
XMM-Newton analysis. The halo components, meanwhile, are hotter than previously
determined, implying our Suzaku spectra are harder than our XMM-Newton spectra.",2007-03-08T19:36:49Z
Rigid unit modes in tetrahedral crystals,"The 'rigid unit mode' (RUM) model requires unit blocks, in our case
tetrahedra of SiO_4 groups, to be rigid within first order of the displacements
of the O-ions. The wave-vectors of the lattice vibrations, which obey this
rigidity, are determined analytically. Lattices with inversion symmetry yield
generically surfaces of RUMs in reciprocal space, whereas lattices without this
symmetry yield generically lines of RUMs. Only in exceptional cases as in
beta-quartz a surface of RUMs appears, if inversion symmetry is lacking. The
occurence of planes and bending surfaces, straight and bent lines is discussed.
Explicit calculations are performed for five modifications of SiO_2 crystals.",2007-03-19T14:11:27Z
Enhancement of Superconductivity by Exchange Bias,"In this work we study the transport properties of hybrids that consist of
exchange biased ferromagnets (FMs) combined with a low-Tc superconductor (SC).
Not only different FMs but also various structural topologies have been
investigated: results for multilayers of La(1-x)CaxMnO3 combined with Nb in the
form of [La0.33Ca0.67MnO3/La0.60Ca0.40MnO3]15/Nb, and for more simple
Ni80Fe20/Nb/Ni80Fe20 trilayers and Ni80Fe20/Nb bilayers are presented. The
results obtained in all hybrid structures studied in this work clearly uncover
that the exchange bias mechanism promotes superconductivity. Our findings
assist the understanding of the contradictory results that have been reported
in the recent literature regarding the transport properties of relative
FM/SC/FM spin valves.",2007-01-12T11:59:14Z
Percolation in Hierarchical Scale-Free Nets,"We study the percolation phase transition in hierarchical scale-free nets.
Depending on the method of construction, the nets can be fractal or small-world
(the diameter grows either algebraically or logarithmically with the net size),
assortative or disassortative (a measure of the tendency of like-degree nodes
to be connected to one another), or possess various degrees of clustering. The
percolation phase transition can be analyzed exactly in all these cases, due to
the self-similar structure of the hierarchical nets. We find different types of
criticality, illustrating the crucial effect of other structural properties
besides the scale-free degree distribution of the nets.",2007-03-06T16:00:35Z
"Magnetic focusing in normal-superconductor hybrid systems: a
  semiclassical analysis","We study a transverse electron-hole focusing effect in a
normal-superconductor system. The spectrum of the quasiparticles is calculated
both quantum mechanically and in semiclassical approximation, showing an
excellent agreement. A semiclassical conductance formula is derived which takes
into account the effect of electron-like as well as hole-like quasiparticles.
At low magnetic field the semiclassical conductance shows characteristic
oscillations due to the Andreev reflection, while at higher fields it goes to
zero. These findigs are in line with the results of previous quantum
calculations and with the expectations based on the classical dynamics of the
quasiparticles.",2007-03-20T19:42:09Z
A Semiclassical Model for Molecular Localization in Ammonia,"The pedagogic two stste system of the ammonia molecule is used to illustrate
the phenomenon of environment induced molecular localization in pyramidal
molecules. A semiclassical model is used to describe a gas of pyramidal
molecules interacting via hard ball collisions. This modifies the tunnelling
dynamics between the classical equilibrium configurations of an isolated
molecule. For sufficiently high pressures, the model explains molecular
localization in these classical configurations. The decrease in the inversion
line frequency of ammonia, noted upon increase in pressure, is also studied.",2007-03-20T12:50:23Z
"Unstable magnetohydrodynamical continuous spectrum of accretion disks. A
  new route to magnetohydrodynamical turbulence in accretion disks","We present a detailed study of localised magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)
instabilities occuring in two--dimensional magnetized accretion disks. We model
axisymmetric MHD disk tori, and solve the equations governing a
two--dimensional magnetized accretion disk equilibrium and linear wave modes
about this equilibrium. We show the existence of novel MHD instabilities in
these two--dimensional equilibria which do not occur in an accretion disk in
the cylindrical limit. The disk equilibria are numerically computed by the
FINESSE code. The stability of accretion disks is investigated analytically as
well as numerically. We use the PHOENIX code to compute all the waves and
instabilities accessible to the computed disk equilibrium. We concentrate on
strongly magnetized disks and sub--Keplerian rotation in a large part of the
disk. These disk equilibria show that the thermal pressure of the disk can only
decrease outwards if there is a strong gravitational potential. Our theoretical
stability analysis shows that convective continuum instabilities can only
appear if the density contours coincide with the poloidal magnetic flux
contours. Our numerical results confirm and complement this theoretical
analysis. Furthermore, these results show that the influence of gravity can
either be stabilizing or destabilizing on this new kind of MHD instability. In
the likely case of a non--constant density, the height of the disk should
exceed a threshold before this type of instability can play a role. This
localised MHD instability provides an ideal, linear route to MHD turbulence in
strongly magnetized accretion disk tori.",2007-03-22T10:49:11Z
A general class of braneworld wormholes,"The brane cosmology scenario is based on the idea that our Universe is a
3-brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk. In this work, a general class of
braneworld wormholes is explored with $R\neq 0$, where $R$ is the four
dimensional Ricci scalar, and specific solutions are further analyzed. A
fundamental ingredient of traversable wormholes is the violation of the null
energy condition (NEC). However, it is the effective total stress energy tensor
that violates the latter, and in this work, the stress energy tensor confined
on the brane, threading the wormhole, is imposed to satisfy the NEC. It is also
shown that in addition to the local high-energy bulk effects, nonlocal
corrections from the Weyl curvature in the bulk may induce a NEC violating
signature on the brane. Thus, braneworld gravity seems to provide a natural
scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes.",2007-01-24T18:02:33Z
Mixtures of ultracold fermions with unequal masses,"We analyze the phase diagram of superfluidity for two-species fermion
mixtures from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) limit as a function of scattering parameter, population imbalance and
mass anisotropy. We identify regions corresponding to normal, or
uniform/non-uniform superfluid phases, and discuss topological quantum phase
transitions in the BCS, unitarity and BEC limits. We derive the Ginzburg-Landau
equation near the critical temperature, and show that it describes a dilute
mixture of paired and unpaired fermions in the BEC limit. We also obtain the
zero temperature low frequency and long wavelength collective excitation
spectrum, and recover the Bogoliubov relation for weakly interacting dilute
bosons in the BEC limit. Lastly, we discuss the effects of harmonic traps and
the resulting density profiles in the BEC regime.",2007-03-12T01:13:51Z
Single molecule pulling with large time steps,"Recently, we presented a generalisation of the Jarzynski non-equilibrium work
theorem for phase space mappings. The formalism shows that one can determine
free energy differences from approximate trajectories obtained from molecular
dynamics simulations in which very large timesteps are used. In this work we
test the method by simulating the force induced unfolding of a deca-alanine
helix in vacuum. The excellent agreement between results obtained with a small,
conservative time step of 0.5 fs and results obtained with a time step of 3.2
fs (i.e., close to the stability limit) indicates that the large time step
approach is practical for such complex biomolecules. We further adapt the
method of Hummer and Szabo for the simulation of single-molecule force
spectroscopy experiments to the large time step method. While trajectories
generated with large steps are approximate and may be unphysical - in the
simulations presented here we observe a violation of the equipartition theorem
- the computed free energies are exact in principle. In terms of efficiency,
the optimum time step for the unfolding simulations lies in the range 1-3 fs.",2007-01-30T12:26:02Z
Magnetoelectric coupling in epitaxial orthorhombic YMnO3 thin films,"We have grown epitaxial thin-films of the orthorhombic phase of YMnO3 oxide
on Nb:SrTiO3(001) substrates and their structure, magnetic and dielectric
response have been measured. We have found that a substrate-induced strain
produces an in-plane compression of the YMnO3 unit cell. The
temperature-dependent magnetization curves display a significant ZFC-FC
hysteresis at temperatures below the Neel temperature (TN around 40K). The
dielectric constant increases gradually (up to 26%) below TN and mimics the ZFC
magnetization curve. We argue that these effects are a manifestation of
magnetoelectric coupling in thin films and that the magnetic structure of YMnO3
can be controlled by substrate selection.",2007-01-16T18:06:16Z
Geometry and the complexity of matrix multiplication,"We survey results in algebraic complexity theory, focusing on matrix
multiplication. Our goals are
  (i.) to show how open questions in algebraic complexity theory are naturally
posed as questions in geometry and representation theory, (ii.) to motivate
researchers to work on these questions, and (iii.) to point out relations with
more general problems in geometry. The key geometric objects for our study are
the secant varieties of Segre varieties. We explain how these varieties are
also useful for algebraic statistics, the study of phylogenetic invariants, and
quantum computing.",2007-03-12T22:11:55Z
A Hike in the Phases of the 1-in-3 Satisfiability,"We summarise our results for the random $\epsilon$--1-in-3 satisfiability
problem, where $\epsilon$ is a probability of negation of the variable. We

Hard/Easy transitions.",2007-02-18T16:27:49Z
"Theory of Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling and Dissipation in High-Tc
  Josephson Junctions","We have investigated macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in in-plane high-Tc
superconductor Josephson junctions and the influence of the nodal-quasiparticle
and the zero energy bound states (ZES) on MQT. We have shown that the presence
of the ZES at the interface between the insulator and the superconductor leads
to strong Ohmic quasiparticle dissipation. Therefore, the MQT rate is
noticeably suppressed in comparison with the c-axis junctions in which ZES are
completely absent.",2007-01-30T04:21:47Z
The Electron-Glass in samples approaching the Mesoscopic regime,"We study the dependence of the glassy properties of strongly localized
indium-oxide films on the sample lateral dimensions. Characteristic mesoscopic
effects such as reproducible conductance fluctuations (CF) are readily
observable in gated structures for sample size smaller than 100 microns
measured at 4K, and the relative amplitude of the CF decreases with the sample
volume as does the flicker noise. By contrast, down to sample size of few
microns, the non-equilibrium features that are attributed to the electron-glass
are indistinguishable from those observed in macroscopic samples, and in
particular, the relaxation dynamics is independent of sample size down to 2
microns. In addition, The usual features that characterize the electron-glass
including slow-relaxation, memory effects, and full-aging behavior are all
observed in the `mesoscopic' regime, and they appear to be independent of the
conductance fluctuations.",2007-03-06T12:05:54Z
"Nonperturbative Dynamical Theory and A Scheme for Nonequilibrium
  Transport","We develop a nonperturbative dynamical theory (NDT) that is useful for
treating nonequilibrium transport in a system with strong correlation. We apply
our NDT to the single-impurity Anderson model in equilibrium to check its
reliability by comparing with the results of numerical renormalization group
method (NRG). We finally suggest a self-consistent loop to calculate the
current in a lead-dot-lead system with Kondo coupling.",2007-01-31T05:04:35Z
Discriminating and Identifying Codes in the Binary Hamming Space,"Let $F^n$ be the binary $n$-cube, or binary Hamming space of dimension $n$,
endowed with the Hamming distance, and ${\cal E}^n$ (respectively, ${\cal
O}^n$) the set of vectors with even (respectively, odd) weight. For $r\geq 1$
and $x\in F^n$, we denote by $B_r(x)$ the ball of radius $r$ and centre $x$. A
code $C\subseteq F^n$ is said to be $r$-identifying if the sets $B_r(x) \cap
C$, $x\in F^n$, are all nonempty and distinct. A code $C\subseteq {\cal E}^n$
is said to be $r$-discriminating if the sets $B_r(x) \cap C$, $x\in {\cal
O}^n$, are all nonempty and distinct. We show that the two definitions, which
were given for general graphs, are equivalent in the case of the Hamming space,
in the following sense: for any odd $r$, there is a bijection between the set
of $r$-identifying codes in $F^n$ and the set of $r$-discriminating codes in
$F^{n+1}$. We then extend previous studies on constructive upper bounds for the
minimum cardinalities of identifying codes in the Hamming space.",2007-03-14T15:00:22Z
"Dynamics and rheology of a dilute suspension of vesicles: higher order
  theory","Vesicles under shear flow exhibit various dynamics: tank-treading ($tt$),
tumbling ($tb$) and vacillating-breathing ($vb$). A consistent higher order
theory reveals a direct bifurcation from $tt$ to $tb$ if $C_a\equiv \tau
\dot\gamma $ is small enough ($\tau$= vesicle relaxation time towards
equilibrium shape, $\dot\gamma$=shear rate). At larger $C_a$ the $tb$ is
preceded by the $vb$ mode. For $C_a\gg 1$ we recover the leading order original
calculation, where the $vb$ mode coexists with $tb$. The consistent calculation
reveals several quantitative discrepancies with recent works, and points to new
features. We analyse rheology and find that the effective viscosity exhibits a
minimum at $tt-tb$ and $tt-vb$ bifurcation points.",2007-03-27T07:13:30Z
The Berry phase in ferromagnetic spin systems and anomalous Hall Effect,"We have shown that the study of topological aspects of the underlying
geometry in a ferromagnetic spin system gives rise to an intrinsic Berry phase.
This real space Berry phase arises due to the spin rotations of conducting
electrons which can be manifested as a further contribution in anomalous Hall
effect.",2007-01-18T10:09:34Z
Excited states from time-dependent density functional theory,"Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is presently enjoying
enormous popularity in quantum chemistry, as a useful tool for extracting
electronic excited state energies. This article explains what TDDFT is, and how
it differs from ground-state DFT. We show the basic formalism, and illustrate
with simple examples. We discuss its implementation and possible sources of
error. We discuss many of the major successes and challenges of the theory,
including weak fields, strong fields, continuum states, double excitations,
charge transfer, high harmonic generation, multiphoton ionization, electronic
quantum control, van der Waals interactions, transport through single
molecules, currents, quantum defects, and, elastic electron-atom scattering.",2007-03-22T18:23:55Z
Thermal Spin-Transfer Torques in Magnetoelectronic Devices,"We predict that the magnetization direction of a ferromagnet can be reversed
by the spin-transfer torque accompanying spin-polarized thermoelectric heat
currents. We illustrate the concept by applying a finite-element theory of
thermoelectric transport in disordered magnetoelectronic circuits and devices
to metallic spin valves. When thermalization is not complete, a spin heat
accumulation vector is found in the normal metal spacer, i.e., a directional
imbalance in the temperature of majority and minority spins.",2007-01-09T06:44:58Z
Segue Between Favorable and Unfavorable Solvation,"Solvation of small and large clusters are studied by simulation, considering
a range of solvent-solute attractive energy strengths. Over a wide range of
conditions, both for solvation in the Lennard-Jones liquid and in the SPC model
of water, it is shown that the mean solvent density varies linearly with
changes in solvent-solute adhesion or attractive energy strength. This behavior
is understood from the perspective of Weeks' theory of solvation [Ann. Rev.
Phys. Chem. 2002, 53, 533] and supports theories based upon that perspective.",2007-03-26T20:53:49Z
"Delayed Feedback Capacity of Stationary Sources over Linear Gaussian
  Noise Channels","We consider a linear Gaussian noise channel used with delayed feedback. The
channel noise is assumed to be a ARMA (autoregressive and/or moving average)
process. We reformulate the Gaussian noise channel into an intersymbol
interference channel with white noise, and show that the delayed-feedback of
the original channel is equivalent to the instantaneous-feedback of the derived
channel. By generalizing results previously developed for Gaussian channels
with instantaneous feedback and applying them to the derived intersymbol
interference channel, we show that conditioned on the delayed feedback, a
conditional Gauss-Markov source achieves the feedback capacity and its Markov
memory length is determined by the noise spectral order and the feedback delay.
A Kalman-Bucy filter is shown to be optimal for processing the feedback. The
maximal information rate for stationary sources is derived in terms of channel
input power constraint and the steady state solution of the Riccati equation of
the Kalman-Bucy filter used in the feedback loop.",2007-01-16T19:42:01Z
"Displacements of 180-degree domain walls in electroded ferroelectric
  single crystals: the effect of surface layers on restoring force","Macroscopic properties of ferroelectric samples, including those in form of
thin films, are, to large extent, influenced by their domain structure. In this
paper the free energy is calculated for a plate-like sample composed of
nonferroelectric surface layers and ferroelectric central part with
antiparallel domains. The sample is provided with electrodes with a defined
potential difference. The effect of applied field and its small changes on the
resulting domain structure is discussed. This makes it possible to determine
the restoring force acting on domain walls which codetermines dielectric and
piezoelectric properties of the sample. Calculations of the potential and free
energy take into account interactions of opposite surfaces and are applicable
also to thin films.",2007-02-13T14:42:25Z
Pairing symmetry in a two-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice,"We investigate superconductivity in a two-orbital Hubbard model on a square
lattice by applying fluctuation exchange approximation. In the present model,
the symmetry of the two orbitals are assumed to be that of an s orbital. Then,
we find that an s-wave spin-triplet orbital-antisymmetric state and a p-wave
spin-singlet orbital-antisymmetric state appear when Hund's rule coupling is
large. These states are prohibited in a single-orbital model within states with
even frequency dependence, but allowed for multi-orbital systems. We also
discuss pairing symmetry in other models which are equivalent to the
two-orbital Hubbard model except for symmetry of orbitals. Finally, we show
that pairing states with a finite total momentum, even without a magnetic
field, are possible in a system with two Fermi-surfaces.",2007-02-27T02:14:01Z
"Transport and Helfand moments in the Lennard-Jones fluid. II. Thermal
  Conductivity","The thermal conductivity is calculated with the Helfand-moment method in the
Lennard-Jones fluid near the triple point. The Helfand moment of thermal
conductivity is here derived for molecular dynamics with periodic boundary
conditions. Thermal conductivity is given by a generalized Einstein relation
with this Helfand moment. We compute thermal conductivity by this new method
and compare it with our own values obtained by the standard Green-Kubo method.
The agreement is excellent.",2007-01-11T17:54:30Z
"Online Supplementary Material: Low temperature vortex liquid in $\rm
  La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$","We report here the supplementary material for Ref. [1]. Using torque
magnetometry, we measured the magnetization anisotropy of 7 crystals of $\rm
La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ (LSCO). In optimally-doped cuprates, the bulk susceptibility
is dominated by the paramagnetic van-Vleck orbital term $\chi_{orb}$ which has
a significant anisotropy ($\chi^{orb}_c>\chi^{orb}_{ab}$) that changes weakly
with $T$ (subscripts $c$ and ${ab}$ identify quantities measured with $\bf
H||c$ and $\bf H\perp c$, respectively). Moreover, in the lightly-doped regime,
the paramagnetic spin susceptibilities $\chi^s_c$ and $\chi^s_{ab}$ become
significantly large below the interval 40-60 K. However, the spin
susceptibility is very nearly isotropic (except below 10 K where its anisotropy
becomes measurable). Against the large orbital and spin terms, the weak
diamagnetic signal is very difficult to resolve using standard bulk
magnetometry in lightly-doped cuprates. By contrast, torque magnetometry
selectively detects the orbital diamagnetism generated by supercurrents
confined to the CuO$_2$ layers while ignoring the large spin contribution when
it is isotropic. The orbital van-Vleck contribution is also detected, but as a
``background'' that is $H$-linear to intense fields and only mildly $T$
dependent.",2007-03-13T17:18:46Z
"No evidence for spontaneous orbital currents in finite size studies of
  three-band models for CuO planes","We have numerically evaluated the current-current correlations for three-band
models of the CuO planes in high-T_c superconductors at hole doping x=1/8. The
results show no evidence for the orbital current patterns proposed by Varma. If
such patterns exist, the associated energy is estimated to be smaller than 5
meV per link even if epsilon_p-epsilon_d=0. Assuming that the three-band models
are adequate, quantum critical fluctuations of such patterns hence cannot be
responsible for phenomena occurring at significantly higher energies, such as
superconductivity or the anomalous properties of the pseudogap phase.",2007-01-11T14:33:30Z
"Rapidly rotating boson molecules with long or short range repulsion: an
  exact diagonalization study","The Hamiltonian for a small number, N <= 11, of bosons in a rapidly rotating
harmonic trap, interacting via a short range (contact potential) or a long
range (Coulomb) interaction, is studied via an exact diagonalization in the
lowest Landau level. Our analysis shows that, for both low and high fractional
fillings, the bosons localize and form rotating boson molecules (RBMs)
consisting of concentric polygonal rings. Focusing on systems with the number
of trapped atoms sufficiently large to form multi-ring bosonic molecules, we
find that, as a function of the rotational frequency and regardless of the type
of repulsive interaction, the ground-state angular momenta grow in specific
steps that coincide with the number of localized bosons on each concentric
ring. Comparison of the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) for both
interactions suggests that the degree of crystalline correlations appears to
depend more on the fractional filling nu than on the range of the interaction.
The RBMs behave as nonrigid rotors, i.e., the concentric rings rotate
independently of each other. At filling fractions nu < 1/2, we observe well
developed crystallinity in the CPDs (two-point correlation functions). For
larger filling fractions nu > 1/2, observation of similar molecular patterns
requires consideration of even higher-order correlation functions.",2007-01-15T14:58:52Z
"A Union Bound Approximation for Rapid Performance Evaluation of
  Punctured Turbo Codes","In this paper, we present a simple technique to approximate the performance
union bound of a punctured turbo code. The bound approximation exploits only
those terms of the transfer function that have a major impact on the overall
performance. We revisit the structure of the constituent convolutional encoder
and we develop a rapid method to calculate the most significant terms of the
transfer function of a turbo encoder. We demonstrate that, for a large
interleaver size, this approximation is very accurate. Furthermore, we apply
our proposed method to a family of punctured turbo codes, which we call
pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We conclude by emphasizing the benefits of our
approach compared to those employed previously. We also highlight the
advantages of pseudo-random puncturing over other puncturing schemes.",2007-02-19T09:18:22Z
Electron turbulence at nanoscale junctions,"Electron transport through a nanostructure can be characterized in part using
concepts from classical fluid dynamics. It is thus natural to ask how far the
analogy can be taken, and whether the electron liquid can exhibit nonlinear
dynamical effects such as turbulence. Here we present an ab-initio study of the
electron dynamics in nanojunctions which reveals that the latter indeed
exhibits behavior quite similar to that of a classical fluid. In particular, we
find that a transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs with increasing
current, corresponding to increasing Reynolds numbers. These results reveal
unexpected features of electron dynamics and shed new light on our
understanding of transport properties of nanoscale systems.",2007-03-02T23:30:32Z

an overdoped Tl$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ with $T_{c}$ = 85 K. We observed
a relatively high density of low-energy quasi-particle excitations at the
vortex cores in a magnetic field of 7.4847 T along the c axis, in contrast to

Collective coherence in planar semiconductor microcavities,"Semiconductor microcavities, in which strong coupling of excitons to confined
photon modes leads to the formation of exciton-polariton modes, have
increasingly become a focus for the study of spontaneous coherence, lasing, and
condensation in solid state systems. This review discusses the significant
experimental progress to date, the phenomena associated with coherence which
have been observed, and also discusses in some detail the different theoretical
models that have been used to study such systems. We consider both the case of
non-resonant pumping, in which coherence may spontaneously arise, and the
related topics of resonant pumping, and the optical parametric oscillator.",2007-02-07T09:13:31Z
Populating the Galaxy with close Be binaries,"Be/X-ray binaries comprise roughly two-thirds of the high-mass X-ray binaries
(HMXBs), which is a class of X-ray binaries that results from the high mass of
the companion or donor star (> 10 solar masses). Currently the formation and
evolution of X-ray producing Be binaries is a matter of great debate. Modelling
of these systems requires knowledge of Be star evolution and also consideration
of how the evolution changes when the star is in close proximity to a
companion. Within this work we complete a full population synthesis study of Be
binaries for the Galaxy. The results for the first time match aspects of the
observational data, most notably the observed upper limit to the period
distribution. We conclude that greater detailed studies on the evolution of Be
stars within X-ray binaries needs to be completed, so that rapid binary
evolution population synthesis packages may best evolve these systems.",2007-03-07T07:43:32Z
The Hadwiger Number of Jordan Regions is Unbounded,"We show that for every n > 0 there is a planar topological disk A_0 and n

"Detection of extended very-high-energy gamma-ray emission towards the
  young stellar cluster Westerlund 2","Results from gamma-ray observations by the H.E.S.S. telescope array in the
direction of the young stellar cluster Westerlund 2 are presented. Stereoscopic
imaging of Cherenkov light emission of gamma-ray induced showers in the
atmosphere is used to study the celestial region around the massive Wolf-Rayet
(WR) binary WR 20a. Spectral and positional analysis is performed using
standard event reconstruction techniques and parameter cuts. The detection of a
new gamma-ray source is reported from H.E.S.S. observations in 2006. HESS
J1023-575 is found to be coincident with the young stellar cluster Westerlund 2
in the well-known HII complex RCW 49. The source is detected with a statistical
significance of more than 9 sigma, and shows extension beyond a point-like
object within the H.E.S.S. point-spread function. The differential gamma-ray
spectrum of the emission region is measured over approximately two orders of
magnitude in flux. The spatial coincidence between HESS J1023-575 and the young
open cluster Westerlund 2, hosting e.g. the massive WR binary WR 20a, requires
a look into a variety of potential models to account for the observed
very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission. Considered emission scenarios
include emission from the colliding wind zone of WR 20a, collective stellar
winds from the extraordinary ensemble of hot and massive stars in the stellar
cluster Westerlund 2, diffusive shock acceleration in the wind-blown bubble
itself, and supersonic winds breaking out into the interstellar medium (ISM).
The observed source extension argues against a single star origin of the
observed VHE emission.",2007-03-15T22:43:48Z
"Exact solution of the zero-range process: fundamental diagram of the
  corresponding exclusion process","In this paper, we propose a general way of computing expectation values in
the zero-range process, using an exact form of the partition function. As an
example, we provide the fundamental diagram (the flux-density plot) of the
asymmetric exclusion process corresponding to the zero-range process.We express
the partition function for the steady state by the Lauricella hypergeometric
function, and thereby have two exact fundamental diagrams each for the parallel
and random sequential update rules. Meanwhile, from the viewpoint of
equilibrium statistical mechanics, we work within the canonical ensemble but
the result obtained is certainly in agreement with previous works done in the
grand canonical ensemble.",2007-01-10T07:43:59Z
"Acoustic Analogue of Bloch Oscillations and Resonant Zener Tunneling in
  Ultrasonic Superlattices","We demonstrate the existence of Bloch oscillations of acoustic fields in
sound propagation through a superlattice of water cavities and layers of methyl
methacrylate. To obtain the acoustic equivalent of a Wannier-Stark ladder, we
have employed a set of cavities with different thicknesses. Bloch oscillations
are observed as time-resolved oscillations of transmission in a direct analogy
to electronic Bloch oscillations in biased semiconductor superlattices.
Moreover, for a particular gradient of cavity thicknesses, an overlap of two
acoustic minibands occurs, which results in resonant Zener-like transmission
enhancement.",2007-01-18T10:58:07Z
"Nonlinearities and Parametric Amplification in Superconducting Coplanar
  Waveguide Resonators","Experimental investigations of the nonlinear properties of superconducting
niobium coplanar waveguide resonators are reported. The nonlinearity due to a
current dependent kinetic inductance of the center conductor is strong enough
to realize bifurcation of the nonlinear oscillator. When driven with two
frequencies near the threshold for bifurcation, parametric amplification with a
gain of +22.4 dB is observed.",2007-02-12T16:39:47Z
Conceptual aspects of line tensions,"We analyze two representative systems containing a three-phase-contact line:
a liquid lens at a fluid--fluid interface and a liquid drop in contact with a
gas phase residing on a solid substrate. We discuss to which extent the
decomposition of the grand canonical free energy of such systems into volume,
surface, and line contributions is unique in spite of the freedom one has in
positioning the Gibbs dividing interfaces. In the case of a lens it is found
that the line tension is independent of arbitrary choices of the Gibbs dividing
interfaces. In the case of a drop, however, one arrives at two different
possible definitions of the line tension. One of them corresponds seamlessly to
that applicable to the lens. The line tension defined this way turns out to be
independent of choices of the Gibbs dividing interfaces. In the case of the
second definition,however, the line tension does depend on the choice of the
Gibbs dividing interfaces. We provide equations for the equilibrium contact
angles which are form-invariant with respect to notional shifts of dividing
interfaces which only change the description of the system. Conceptual
consistency requires to introduce additional stiffness constants attributed to
the line. We show how these constants transform as a function of the relative
displacements of the dividing interfaces. The dependences of the contact angles
on lens or drop volumes do not render the line tension alone but a combination
of the line tension, the Tolman length, and the stiffness constants of the
line.",2007-03-30T16:06:20Z
Spin Drag and Spin-Charge Separation in Cold Fermi Gases,"Low-energy spin and charge excitations of one-dimensional interacting
fermions are completely decoupled and propagate with different velocities.
These modes however can decay due to several possible mechanisms. In this paper
we expose a new facet of spin-charge separation: not only the speeds but also
the damping rates of spin and charge excitations are different. While the
propagation of long-wavelength charge excitations is essentially ballistic,
spin propagation is intrinsically damped and diffusive. We suggest that cold
Fermi gases trapped inside a tight atomic waveguide offer the opportunity to
measure the spin-drag relaxation rate that controls the broadening of a spin
packet.",2007-02-20T15:57:14Z
Heat Transistor: Demonstration of Gate-Controlled Electron Refrigeration,"We present experiments on a superconductor-normal metal electron refrigerator
in a regime where single-electron charging effects are significant. The system
functions as a heat transistor, i.e., the heat flux out from the normal metal
island can be controlled with a gate voltage. A theoretical model developed
within the framework of single-electron tunneling provides a full quantitative
agreement with the experiment. This work serves as the first experimental
observation of Coulombic control of heat transfer and, in particular, of
refrigeration in a mesoscopic system.",2007-02-15T13:56:56Z
Distributed Detection in Sensor Networks with Limited Range Sensors,"We consider a multi-object detection problem over a sensor network (SNET)
with limited range sensors. This problem complements the widely considered
decentralized detection problem where all sensors observe the same object.
While the necessity for global collaboration is clear in the decentralized
detection problem, the benefits of collaboration with limited range sensors is
unclear and has not been widely explored. In this paper we develop a
distributed detection approach based on recent development of the false
discovery rate (FDR). We first extend the FDR procedure and develop a
transformation that exploits complete or partial knowledge of either the
observed distributions at each sensor or the ensemble (mixture) distribution
across all sensors. We then show that this transformation applies to
multi-dimensional observations, thus extending FDR to multi-dimensional
settings. We also extend FDR theory to cases where distributions under both
null and positive hypotheses are uncertain. We then propose a robust
distributed algorithm to perform detection. We further demonstrate scalability
to large SNETs by showing that the upper bound on the communication complexity
scales linearly with the number of sensors that are in the vicinity of objects
and is independent of the total number of sensors. Finally, we deal with
situations where the sensing model may be uncertain and establish robustness of
our techniques to such uncertainties.",2007-01-26T20:54:32Z
"Spin Ladder with Anisotropic Ferromagnetic Legs in a Transverse Magnetic
  Field","We study the ground state phase diagram of a two-leg spin ladder with
anisotropic ferromagnetic leg couplings under the influence of a symmetry
breaking transverse magnetic field by the exact diagonalization technique. In
the case of antiferromagnetic coupling between legs we identified two phase
transitions in the plane of magnetic field vs interchain coupling strength. The
first one corresponds to the transition from the gapped rung-singlet phase to
the gapped stripe-ferromagnetic phase. The second one represents the transition
from the gapped stripe-ferromagnetic phase into the fully polarized
ferromagnetic phase.",2007-01-06T18:18:18Z
Enhancing the conductance of a two-electron nanomechanical oscillator,"We consider electron transport through a mobile island (i.e., a
nanomechanical oscillator) which can accommodate one or two excess electrons
and show that, in contrast to immobile islands, the Coulomb blockade peaks,
associated with the first and second electrons entering the island, have
different functional dependences on the nano-oscillator parameters when the
island coupling to its leads is asymmetric. In particular, the conductance for
the second electron (i.e., when the island is already charged) is greatly
enhanced in comparison to the conductance of the first electron in the presence
of an external electric field. We also analyze the temperature dependence of
the two conduction peaks and show that these exhibit different functional
behaviors.",2007-02-09T11:15:58Z
"Directed polymer in a random medium of dimension 1+1 and 1+3: weights
  statistics in the low-temperature phase","We consider the low-temperature $T<T_c$ disorder-dominated phase of the
directed polymer in a random potentiel in dimension 1+1 (where $T_c=\infty$)
and 1+3 (where $T_c<\infty$). To characterize the localization properties of
the polymer of length $L$, we analyse the statistics of the weights $w_L(\vec
r)$ of the last monomer as follows. We numerically compute the probability
distributions $P_1(w)$ of the maximal weight $w_L^{max}= max_{\vec r} [w_L(\vec
r)]$, the probability distribution $\Pi(Y_2)$ of the parameter $Y_2(L)=
\sum_{\vec r} w_L^2(\vec r) $ as well as the average values of the higher order
moments $Y_k(L)= \sum_{\vec r} w_L^k(\vec r)$. We find that there exists a
temperature $T_{gap}<T_c$ such that (i) for $T<T_{gap}$, the distributions
$P_1(w)$ and $\Pi(Y_2)$ present the characteristic Derrida-Flyvbjerg
singularities at $w=1/n$ and $Y_2=1/n$ for $n=1,2..$. In particular, there
exists a temperature-dependent exponent $\mu(T)$ that governs the main
singularities $P_1(w) \sim (1-w)^{\mu(T)-1}$ and $\Pi(Y_2) \sim
(1-Y_2)^{\mu(T)-1}$ as well as the power-law decay of the moments $
\bar{Y_k(i)} \sim 1/k^{\mu(T)}$. The exponent $\mu(T)$ grows from the value
$\mu(T=0)=0$ up to $\mu(T_{gap}) \sim 2$. (ii) for $T_{gap}<T<T_c$, the
distribution $P_1(w)$ vanishes at some value $w_0(T)<1$, and accordingly the
moments $\bar{Y_k(i)}$ decay exponentially as $(w_0(T))^k$ in $k$. The
histograms of spatial correlations also display Derrida-Flyvbjerg singularities
for $T<T_{gap}$. Both below and above $T_{gap}$, the study of typical and
averaged correlations is in full agreement with the droplet scaling theory.",2007-02-06T09:07:55Z
"Coupled spin-charge drift-diffusion approach for a two-dimensional
  electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling","Based on kinetic equations for the density matrix, drift-diffusion equations
are derived for a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.
Universal results are obtained for the weak coupling case. Most interesting is
the observation that with increasing spin-orbit coupling strengths there is a
sharp transition between spin diffusion and ballistic spin transport. For
strong spin-orbit coupling, when the elastic scattering time is much larger
than the spin relaxation time, undamped spin-coherent waves are identified. The
existence of these long-lived spin-coherent states is confirmed by exact
analytical results obtained from microscopic kinetic equations valid in the
ballistic regime.",2007-01-31T15:13:47Z
"Pairing without Superfluidity: The Ground State of an Imbalanced Fermi
  Mixture","Radio-frequency spectroscopy is used to study pairing in the normal and
superfluid phases of a strongly interacting Fermi gas with imbalanced spin
populations. At high spin imbalances the system does not become superfluid even
at zero temperature. In this normal phase full pairing of the minority atoms is
observed. This demonstrates that mismatched Fermi surfaces do not prevent
pairing but can quench the superfluid state, thus realizing a system of fermion
pairs that do not condense even at the lowest temperature.",2007-02-04T03:43:40Z
Brown dwarf formation by binary disruption,"Context: The principal mechanism by which brown dwarfs form, and its relation
to the formation of higher-mass (i.e. hydrogen-burning) stars, is poorly
understood. Aims: We advocate a new model for the formation of brown dwarfs.
Methods: In this model, brown dwarfs are initially binary companions, formed by
gravitational fragmentation of the outer parts (R > 100 AU) of protostellar
discs around low-mass hydrogen-burning stars. Most of these binaries are then
gently disrupted by passing stars to create a largely single population of
brown dwarfs and low-mass hydrogen-burning stars. Results: This idea is
consistent with the excess of binaries found in low-density pre-main sequence
populations, like that in Taurus, where they should survive longer than in
denser clusters. Conclusions: If brown dwarfs form in this way, as companions
to more massive stars, the difficulty of forming very low-mass prestellar cores
is avoided. Since the disrupted binaries will tend to be those involving
low-mass components and wide orbits, and since disruption will be due to the
gentle tides of passing stars (rather than violent N-body interactions in
small-N sub-clusters), the liberated brown dwarfs will have velocity
dispersions and spatial distributions very similar to higher-mass stars, and
they will be able to retain discs, and thereby to sustain accretion and
outflows. Thus the problems associated with the ejection and turbulence
mechanisms can be avoided. This model implies that most, possibly all, stars
and brown dwarfs form in binary or multiple systems.",2007-03-06T09:16:34Z
Area constrained SOS models of interfaces,"The solid-on solid (SOS) model in two dimensions ($d=2$) is now solved under
the constraint of constant energy and then under the new constraint of constant
total area. From the combinatorial factors $g(E;L,M)$, the new ensemble is
constructed with its free energy $F(A_{tot},T)$ of a membrane of constant
(onedimensional) area $A_{tot}$.
  The entropy per column $Y=(1/L)\log g(E;L,M)$ of rectangular $L\times M$
strips reduces to a common curve in reduced variables. Definitions of the
""area"" and of the interfacial tension, are compared or discussed.
  Analytical calculations are supported with numerical ones and vice versa.
Overall the constraint reduces the ratio of $A_{tot}$ to the projected area
$L$, as compared with canonical calculation, strongly at high temperatures.",2007-01-04T00:35:16Z
"Temperature-extended Jarzynski relation: Application to the numerical
  calculation of the surface tension","We consider a generalization of the Jarzynski relation to the case where the
system interacts with a bath for which the temperature is not kept constant but
can vary during the transformation. We suggest to use this relation as a
replacement to the thermodynamic perturbation method or the Bennett method for
the estimation of the order-order surface tension by Monte Carlo simulations.
To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we present some numerical data
for the 3D Ising model.",2007-02-02T11:06:31Z
Size effects in the magnetic behaviour of TbAl_2 milled alloys,"The study of the magnetic properties depending upon mechanical milling of the
ferromagnetic polycrystalline TbAl_2 material is reported. The Rietveld
analysis of the X-ray diffraction data reveals a decrease of the grain size
down to 14 nm and -0.15 % of variation of the lattice parameter, after 300
hours of milling time. Irreversibility in the zero field cooled - field cooled
(ZFC-FC) DC-susceptibility and clear peaks in the AC susceptibility between 5
and 300 K show that the long-range ferromagnetic structure is inhibited in
favour of a disordered spin arrangement below 45 K. This glassy behaviour is
also deduced from the variation of the irreversibility transition with the
field (H^{2/3}) and frequency. The magnetization process of the bulk TbAl_2 is
governed by domain wall thermal activation processes. By contrast, in the
milled samples, cluster-glass properties arise as a result of cooperative
interactions due to the substitutional disorder. The interactions are also
influenced by the nanograin structure of the milled alloys, showing a variation
of coercivity with the grain size, below the crossover between the multi- and
single-domain behaviours.",2007-03-19T17:01:05Z
"Effect of oxygen isotope substitution and crystal micro-structure on
  magnetic ordering and phase separation in {$\rm
  (La_{1-y}Pr_{y})_{0.7}Ca_{0.3}MnO_3$}","The crystal and magnetic structures of the specified CMR manganite system
have been studied as a function of $y=(0.2-1)$ across the metal-insulator (MI)
transition, and of the oxygen mass ($^{16}$O, $^{18}$O). We quantitatively show
how the polaronic narrowing of the carrier bandwidth and the crystal lattice
micro-strains control the volume fractions of the mesoscopic ferro- and
antiferromagnetic clusters. A well-defined dip in the transition temperatures
and the suppression of all the types of long range ordering seen near the
MI-transition at $y\simeq0.9$ indicate a key role of the quenched disorder for
the formation of the long-scale phase separated state.",2007-01-11T14:08:06Z
Unasssuming View-Size Estimation Techniques in OLAP,"Even if storage was infinite, a data warehouse could not materialize all
possible views due to the running time and update requirements. Therefore, it
is necessary to estimate quickly, accurately, and reliably the size of views.
Many available techniques make particular statistical assumptions and their
error can be quite large. Unassuming techniques exist, but typically assume we
have independent hashing for which there is no known practical implementation.
We adapt an unassuming estimator due to Gibbons and Tirthapura: its theoretical
bounds do not make unpractical assumptions. We compare this technique
experimentally with stochastic probabilistic counting, LogLog probabilistic
counting, and multifractal statistical models. Our experiments show that we can
reliably and accurately (within 10%, 19 times out 20) estimate view sizes over
large data sets (1.5 GB) within minutes, using almost no memory. However, only
Gibbons-Tirthapura provides universally tight estimates irrespective of the
size of the view. For large views, probabilistic counting has a small edge in
accuracy, whereas the competitive sampling-based method (multifractal) we
tested is an order of magnitude faster but can sometimes provide poor estimates
(relative error of 100%). In our tests, LogLog probabilistic counting is not
competitive. Experimental validation on the US Census 1990 data set and on the
Transaction Processing Performance (TPC H) data set is provided.",2007-03-12T21:42:59Z
Unraveling the origin of the Monoceros Stellar Ring,"We compare the predictions of the Pe\~narrubia et al. (2005) model for the
Monoceros stellar ring around the Milky Way with new observational constraints
that provide deeper insights on its origin. Recently, Grillmair (2006) found a
coherent sub-structure in a panoramic analysis of SDSS data, spanning 5x65
deg^2 above the Galactic plane towards the anticenter. We show here that this
structure strikingly matches the prior model predictions in projected position
on the sky and the distance (~10 kpc) to within 20%. Newly measured velocities
within this sub-structure also match the model predictions perfectly. This
match suggests that the model assumptions are correct, namely, that the
Monoceros Ring corresponds to a tidal stream wrapping the Milky Way that
results from a single disruption event of a satellite (M~5x10e8 M_sun) with a
prograde, low-inclination, low-eccentric orbit. Further support for the
external origin of the Mon Ring comes from new metalicity measurements of the
Mon Ring, which show that this system is much more metal poor than star
clusters in the outer Galactic disk at the same radius, and independent
detections of RRLyr over-densities in the area that are in excellent agreement
with the model predictions. That these observational data can be
comprehensively explained by alternative disk heating scenarios seems not
likely, but would need to be checked by detailed modeling.",2007-03-23T01:18:53Z
Cosmological Constraints From the 100 Square Degree Weak Lensing Survey,"We present a cosmic shear analysis of the 100 square degree weak lensing
survey, combining data from the CFHTLS-Wide, RCS, VIRMOS-DESCART and GaBoDS
surveys. Spanning ~100 square degrees, with a median source redshift z~0.78,
this combined survey allows us to place tight joint constraints on the matter
density parameter Omega_m, and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum
sigma_8, finding sigma_8*(Omega_m/0.24)^0.59 = 0.84+/-0.05. Tables of the
measured shear correlation function and the calculated covariance matrix for
each survey are included.
  The accuracy of our results is a marked improvement on previous work owing to
three important differences in our analysis; we correctly account for cosmic
variance errors by including a non-Gaussian contribution estimated from
numerical simulations; we correct the measured shear for a calibration bias as
estimated from simulated data; we model the redshift distribution, n(z), of
each survey from the largest deep photometric redshift catalogue currently
available from the CFHTLS-Deep. This catalogue is randomly sampled to reproduce
the magnitude distribution of each survey with the resulting survey dependent
n(z) parametrised using two different models. While our results are consistent
for the n(z) models tested, we find that our cosmological parameter constraints
depend weakly (at the 5% level) on the inclusion or exclusion of galaxies with
low confidence photometric redshift estimates (z>1.5). These high redshift
galaxies are relatively few in number but contribute a significant weak lensing
signal. It will therefore be important for future weak lensing surveys to
obtain near-infra-red data to reliably determine the number of high redshift
galaxies in cosmic shear analyses.",2007-03-22T19:12:11Z
Superconductivity in doped cubic silicon: an ab initio study,"We study within a first-principle approach the band structure, vibrational
modes and electron-phonon coupling in boron, aluminum and phosphorus doped
silicon in the diamond phase. Our results provide evidences that the recently
discovered superconducting transition in boron doped cubic silicon can be
explained within a standard phonon-mediated mechanism. The importance of
lattice compression and dopant related stretching modes are emphasized. We find
that T$_C$ can be increased by one order of magnitude by adopting aluminum
doping instead of boron.",2007-01-10T09:27:24Z
"Slow Relaxation of Spin Structure in Exotic Ferromagnetic Phase of
  Ising-like Heisenberg Kagome Antiferromagnets","In the corner-sharing lattice, magnetic frustration causes macroscopic
degeneracy in the ground state, which prevents systems from ordering. However,
if the ensemble of the degenerate configuration has some global structure, the
system can have a symmetry breaking phenomenon and thus posses a finite
temperature phase transition. As a typical example of such cases, the magnetic
phase transition of the Ising-like Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on the
kagome lattice has been studied. There, a phase transition of the
two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising universality class occurs accompanying with
the uniform spontaneous magnetization. Because of the macroscopic degeneracy in
the ordered phase, the system is found to show an entropy-driven ordering
process, which is quantitatively characterized by the number of ``weathervane
loop''. We investigate this novel type of slow relaxation in regularly
frustrated system.",2007-03-06T10:29:40Z
"Granular mixtures modeled as elastic hard spheres subject to a drag
  force","Granular gaseous mixtures under rapid flow conditions are usually modeled by
a multicomponent system of smooth inelastic hard spheres with constant
coefficients of normal restitution. In the low density regime an adequate
framework is provided by the set of coupled inelastic Boltzmann equations. Due
to the intricacy of the inelastic Boltzmann collision operator, in this paper
we propose a simpler model of elastic hard spheres subject to the action of an
effective drag force, which mimics the effect of dissipation present in the
original granular gas. The Navier--Stokes transport coefficients for a binary
mixture are obtained from the model by application of the Chapman--Enskog
method. The three coefficients associated with the mass flux are the same as
those obtained from the inelastic Boltzmann equation, while the remaining four
transport coefficients show a general good agreement, especially in the case of
the thermal conductivity. Finally, the approximate decomposition of the
inelastic Boltzmann collision operator is exploited to construct a model
kinetic equation for granular mixtures as a direct extension of a known kinetic
model for elastic collisions.",2007-01-23T16:55:44Z
Instanton and Superconductivity in Supersymmetric CP(N-1) Model,"The two dimensional supersymmetric CP(N-1) model has a striking similarity to
the N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions. The BPS mass formula
and the curve of the marginal stability (CMS), which exist in the four
dimensional gauge theory, appears in this two dimensional CP(N-1) model. These
two quntities are derived by a one-dimensional n-vector spin model in the large
n limit for the N=2 case. This mapping is further investigated at the critical
point. An application of the study of the BPS mass formula is proposed to the
phenomena of the spin and charge separations in the Higgs phase.",2007-03-27T02:21:52Z
"Bulk ferromagnetism and large changes in photoluminescence intensity by
  magnetic field in $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$","In this letter we report observation of room temperature ferromagnetism in
bulk Ga$_2$O$_3$ . We also observe large (10-60%) increase/decrease in
photoluminescence. In the red(700 nm wavelength)/blue(500 nm), with the
application of small magnetic field(0.4 Tesla). We argue, that ferromagnetism
occurs entirely due to chains of oxygen(O(3) sites, Fig. 5) vacancies. We
propose a simple model to explain, origin and location of moment, formation of
ferromagnetic dislocation needles, and strong increase/decrease ofred/blue
photoluminescence intensity with magnetic field.",2007-01-11T09:51:53Z
"Weak localization in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As nanostructures","We report on the observation of weak localization in arrays of (Ga,Mn)As
nanowires at millikelvin temperatures. The corresponding phase coherence length
is typically between 100 nm and 200 nm at 20 mK. Strong spin-orbit interaction
in the material is manifested by a weak anti-localization correction around
zero magnetic field.",2007-03-02T11:22:54Z
"Nonradial oscillations of slowly and differentially rotating compact
  stars","The equations describing nonradial adiabatic oscillations of differentially
rotating relativistic stars are derived in relativistic slow rotation
approximation. The differentially rotating configuration is described by a
perturbative version of the relativistic j-constant rotation law. Focusing on
the oscillation properties of the stellar fluid, the adiabatic nonradial
perturbations are studied in the Cowling approximation with a system of five
partial differential equations. In these equations, differential rotation
introduces new coupling terms between the perturbative quantites with respect
to the uniformly rotating stars. In particular, we investigate the axisymmetric
and barotropic oscillations and compare their spectral properties with those
obtained in nonlinear hydrodynamical studies. The perturbative description of
the differentially rotating background and the oscillation spectrum agree
within a few percent with those of the nonlinear studies.",2007-01-22T16:38:23Z
"Dissipative Landau-Zener transitions of a qubit: bath-specific and
  universal behavior","We study Landau-Zener transitions in a qubit coupled to a bath at zero
temperature. A general formula is derived that is applicable to models with a
non-degenerate ground state. We calculate exact transition probabilities for a
qubit coupled to either a bosonic or a spin bath. The nature of the baths and
the qubit-bath coupling is reflected in the transition probabilities. For
diagonal coupling, when the bath causes energy fluctuations of the diabatic
qubit states but no transitions between them, the transition probability
coincides with the standard LZ probability of an isolated qubit. This result is
universal as it does not depend on the specific type of bath. For pure
off-diagonal coupling, by contrast, the tunneling probability is sensitive to
the coupling strength. We discuss the relevance of our results for experiments
on molecular nanomagnets, in circuit QED, and for the fast-pulse readout of
superconducting phase qubits.",2007-03-23T02:27:44Z
Structure factor and dynamics of the helix-coil transition,"Thermodynamical properties of the helix-coil transition were successfully
described in the past by the model of Lifson, Poland and Sheraga. Here we
compute the corresponding structure factor and show that it possesses a
universal scaling behavior near the transition point, even when the transition
is of first order. Moreover, we introduce a dynamical version of this model,
that we solve numerically. A Langevin equation is also proposed to describe the
dynamics of the density of hydrogen bonds. Analytical solution of this equation
shows dynamical scaling near the critical temperature and predicts a gelation
phenomenon above the critical temperature. In the case when comparison of the
two dynamical approaches is possible, the predictions of our phenomenological
theory agree with the results of the Monte Carlo simulations.",2007-01-17T10:45:42Z
Spectropolarimetry Surveys of Obscured AGNs,"The results of spectropolarimetry surveys of obscured AGNs are reviewed,
paying special attention to their implications for the existence of two
populations of type 2 Seyfert galaxies -- hidden Seyfert 1s and ""true"" Seyfert
2s. In this context, the results from our Keck spectropolarimetry survey are
presented. Similar to previous work, we have detected hidden broad-line regions
(HBLRs) in about half of our sample. However, owing to different selection
methods, we find that differences in the properties of HBLR and non-HBLR
objects are much less pronounced than prior reports have indicated.
Spectropolarimetry studies continue to benefit AGN research, as illustrated by
the discovery of double-peaked H-alpha emission in the polarized-flux spectrum
of NGC 2110.",2007-03-04T21:36:55Z

"Generalized Statistics Framework for Rate Distortion Theory with Bregman
  Divergences","A variational principle for the rate distortion (RD) theory with Bregman
divergences is formulated within the ambit of the generalized (nonextensive)
statistics of Tsallis. The Tsallis-Bregman RD lower bound is established.
Alternate minimization schemes for the generalized Bregman RD (GBRD) theory are
derived. A computational strategy to implement the GBRD model is presented. The
efficacy of the GBRD model is exemplified with the aid of numerical
simulations.",2007-01-10T18:48:17Z
"On the feasibility of studying vortex noise in 2D superconductors with
  cold atoms","We investigate the feasibility of using ultracold neutral atoms trapped near
a thin superconductor to study vortex noise close to the
Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii transition temperature. Alkali atoms such as
rubidium probe the magnetic field produced by the vortices. We show that the
relaxation time $T_1$ of the Zeeman sublevel populations can be conveniently
adjusted to provide long observation times. We also show that the transverse
relaxation times $T_2$ for Zeeman coherences are ideal for studying the vortex
noise. We briefly consider the motion of atom clouds held close to the surface
as a method for monitoring the vortex motion.",2007-02-26T18:01:53Z
Dynamic Random Geometric Graphs,"In this work we introduce Dynamic Random Geometric Graphs as a basic rough
model for mobile wireless sensor networks, where communication distances are
set to the known threshold for connectivity of static random geometric graphs.
We provide precise asymptotic results for the expected length of the
connectivity and disconnectivity periods of the network. We believe the formal
tools developed in this work could be of use in future studies in more concrete
settings. In addition, for static random geometric graphs at the threshold for
connectivity, we provide asymptotic expressions on the probability of existence
of components according to their sizes.",2007-02-13T09:00:34Z
"Vibrational Contribution to Density and Current Autocorrelations in a
  Monatomic Liquid","We consider for a monatomic liquid the density and current autocorrelation
functions from the point of view of the Vibration-Transit (V-T) theory of
liquid dynamics. We also consider their Fourier transforms, one of which is
measured by X-ray and neutron scattering. In this description, the motion of
atoms in the liquid is divided into vibrations in a single characteristic
potential valley, called a random valley, and nearly-instantaneous transitions
called transits between valleys. The theory proposes a Hamiltonian for the
vibrational motion, to be corrected to take transits into account; this
Hamiltonian is used to calculate the autocorrelation functions, giving what we
call their vibrational contributions. We discuss the multimode expansions of
the autocorrelation functions, which provide a physically helpful picture of
the decay of fluctuations in terms of n-mode scattering processes; we also note
that the calculation and Fourier transform of the multimode series are
numerically problematic, as successive terms require larger sums and carry
higher powers of the temperature, which is a concern for the liquid whose
temperature is bounded from below by melt. We suggest that these problems are
avoided by directly computing the autocorrelation functions, for which we
provide straightforward formulas, and Fourier transforming them numerically.",2007-02-02T18:04:45Z
"Mott Transition and Strange Metal in Two Dimensions: A View from
  Cellular Dynamical Cluster Approximation","We introduce a Cellular Dynamical Cluster Approximation (CDCA) to study the
nature of the Mott insulator-metal transition in the extended Hubbard model on
a square lattice. At strong coupling, a d-wave Mott insulator is obtained. Hole
doping drives a first order Mott transition to a non-Fermi (nFL) liquid metal.
Remarkably, this nFL is caused by an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe at low
energies due to the non-trivial competition between strong, non-local
interactions and hopping. This constitutes the first explicit realisation of
Anderson's Luttinger liquid idea in two dimensions. Many experimental responses
in the ``strange metal'' phase found around optimal doping in cuprates are
understood naturally within our approach.",2007-01-24T10:24:39Z
Chemical Liquid Phase Deposition of Thin Aluminum Oxide Films,"Thin aluminum oxide films were deposited by a new and simple physicochemical
method called chemical liquid phase deposition (CLD) on semiconductor
materials. Aluminum sulfate with crystallized water and sodium bicarbonate were
used as precursors for film growth, and the control of the system pH value
played an important role in this experiment. The growth rate is 12 nm/h at room
temperature. Post-growth annealing not only densifies and purifies the films,
but results in film crystallization as well. Excellent quality of Al2O3 films
in this work is supported by electron dispersion spectroscopy, Fourier
transform infrared spectrum, X-ray diffraction spectrum and scanning electron
microscopy photograph.",2007-01-19T22:01:30Z
"Topological aspects of graphene: Dirac fermions and the bulk-edge
  correspondence in magnetic fields","We discuss topological aspects of electronic properties of graphene,
including edge effects, with the tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice and
its extensions to show the following: (i) Appearance of the pairn of massless
Dirac dispersions, which is the origin of anomalous properties including a
peculiar quantum Hall effect (QHE), is not accidental to honeycomb, but is
rather generic for a class of two-dimensional lattices that interpolate between
square and $\pi$-flux lattices. Persistence of the peculiar QHE is interpreted
as a topological stability. (ii) While we have the massless Dirac dispersion
only around E=0, the anomalous QHE associated with the Dirac cone unexpectedly
persists for a wide range of the chemical potential. The range is bounded by
van Hove singularities, at which we predict a transition to the ordinary
fermion behavior acompanied by huge jumps in the QHE with a sign change. (iii)
For edges we establish a coincidence between the quantum Hall effect in the
bulk and the quantum Hall effect for the edge states, which is a manifestation
of the topological bulk-edge correspondence. We have also explicitly shown that
the E=0 edge states in honeycomb in zero magnetic field persist in magnetic
field.",2007-01-18T07:49:53Z
Limits to the analogue Hawking temperature in a Bose-Einstein condensate,"Quasi-one dimensional outflow from a dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensate
reservoir is a promising system for the creation of analogue Hawking radiation.
We use numerical modeling to show that stable sonic horizons exist in such a
system under realistic conditions, taking into account the transverse
dimensions and three-body loss. We find that loss limits the analogue Hawking
temperatures achievable in the hydrodynamic regime, with sodium condensates
allowing the highest temperatures. A condensate of 30,000 atoms, with
transverse confinement frequency omega_perp=6800*2*pi Hz, yields horizon
temperatures of about 20 nK over a period of 50 ms. This is at least four times
higher than for other atoms commonly used for Bose-Einstein condensates.",2007-02-02T11:36:12Z
"Spatial noise correlations of a chain of ultracold fermions - A
  numerical study","We present a numerical study of noise correlations, i.e., density-density
correlations in momentum space, in the extended fermionic Hubbard model in one
dimension. In experiments with ultracold atoms, these noise correlations can be
extracted from time-of-flight images of the expanding cloud. Using the
density-matrix renormalization group method to investigate the Hubbard model at
various fillings and interactions, we confirm that the shot noise contains full
information on the correlations present in the system. We point out the
importance of the sum rules fulfilled by the noise correlations and show that
they yield nonsingular structures beyond the predictions of bosonization
approaches. Noise correlations can thus serve as a universal probe of order and
can be used to characterize the many-body states of cold atoms in optical
lattices.",2007-03-13T16:09:57Z
"Magnetic field dissipation in neutron star crusts: from magnetars to
  isolated neutron stars","We study the non--linear evolution of magnetic fields in neutron star crusts
with special attention to the influence of the Hall drift. Our goal is to
understand the conditions for fast dissipation due to the Hall term in the
induction equation. We study the interplay of Ohmic dissipation and Hall drift
in order to find a timescale for the overall crustal field decay. We solve
numerically the Hall induction equation by means of a hybrid method (spectral
in angles but finite differences in the radial coordinate). The microphysical
input consists of the most modern available crustal equation of state,
composition and electrical conductivities. We present the first long term
simulations of the non--linear magnetic field evolution in realistic neutron
star crusts with a stratified electron number density and temperature dependent
conductivity. We show that Hall drift influenced Ohmic dissipation takes place
in neutron star crusts on a timescale of 1 Myr. When the initial magnetic field
has magnetar strength, the fast Hall drift results in an initial rapid
dissipation stage that lasts 10-50 kyr. The interplay of the Hall drift with
the temporal variation and spatial gradient of conductivity tends to favor the
displacement of toroidal fields toward the inner crust, where stable
configurations can last for 1 Myr. We show that the thermally emitting isolated
neutron stars, as the Magnificent Seven, are very likely descendants of neutron
stars born as magnetars.",2007-03-12T15:19:06Z
"Quantum Metamagnetic Transitions Induced by Changes in Fermi-Surface
  Topology -Applications to a Weak Itinerant-Electron Ferromagnet;ZrZn_2","We clarify that metamagnetic transitions in three dimensions show unusual
properties as quantum phase transitions if they are accompanied by changes in
Fermi-surface topology. An unconventional universality deeply affected by the
topological nature of Lifshitz-type transitions emerges around the marginal
quantum critical point (MQCP). Here the MQCP is defined by the meeting point of
the finite temperature critical line and a quantum critical line running on the
zero temperature plane. The MQCP offers a marked contrast with the Ising
universality and the gas-liquid-type criticality satisfied for conventional
metamagnetic transitions. At the MQCP, the inverse magnetic susceptibility
chi^-1 has diverging slope as a function of the magnetization m (namely, | d
chi^-1/d m | -> infty) in one side of the transition, which should not occur in
any conventional quantum critical phenomena. The exponent of the divergence can
be estimated even at finite temperatures. We propose that such an
unconventional universality indeed accounts for the metamagnetic transition in
ZrZn_2.",2007-03-16T14:25:19Z
"Increasing informativity of the Thermally Stimulated Depolarization
  method","Two modifications of the Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Current method
are proposed to improve resolution and sensitivity of the method by connecting
either a real capacitor, or an additional resistor in series with the sample.
It is shown experimentally that high sensitivity of the TSDC method with an air
gap can be obtained, if the gap is substituted by the capacitor, while all
advantages of the method remain in force. It has been found that in one
experiment it is possible not only to measure the TSD current, but also to
obtain data on the Thermally Stimulated Conductivity, if the properly selected
additional resistor is periodically switched on and off.",2007-03-08T18:01:26Z
"Critical temperature and specific heat for Cooper pairing on a spherical
  surface","Based on an exact solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type Hamiltonian
on a spherical surface, we calculate the specific heat for the electron system
with pair correlations on a sphere. We find that it is possible to extract from
the specific heat a temperature above which many-body states with broken Cooper
pairs get populated. Therefore, we define this temperature as the
characteristic temperature signalling the onset of a BCS-type pair-correlated
state for electrons on a spherical surface. Such spherical electron systems are
realized in multielectron bubbles in liquid helium, for which the
above-mentioned characteristic temperature is found to be of the order of
10-100 mK. Both the specific heat and the critical temperature show a
pronounced (4-6%) odd-even parity effect that persists even for numbers of
electrons as large as 10$^6$.",2007-01-23T19:38:20Z
Self-interaction in Green's-function theory of the hydrogen atom,"Atomic hydrogen provides a unique test case for computational electronic
structure methods, since its electronic excitation energies are known
analytically. With only one electron, hydrogen contains no electronic
correlation and is therefore particularly susceptible to spurious
self-interaction errors introduced by certain computational methods. In this
paper we focus on many-body perturbation-theory (MBPT) in Hedin's GW
approximation. While the Hartree-Fock and the exact MBPT self-energy are free
of self-interaction, the correlation part of the GW self-energy does not have
this property. Here we use atomic hydrogen as a benchmark system for GW and
show that the self-interaction part of the GW self-energy, while non-zero, is
small. The effect of calculating the GW self-energy from exact wavefunctions
and eigenvalues, as distinct from those from the local-density approximation,
is also illuminating.",2007-01-24T12:10:45Z
Algorithmic Information Theory: a brief non-technical guide to the field,"This article is a brief guide to the field of algorithmic information theory
(AIT), its underlying philosophy, and the most important concepts. AIT arises
by mixing information theory and computation theory to obtain an objective and
absolute notion of information in an individual object, and in so doing gives
rise to an objective and robust notion of randomness of individual objects.
This is in contrast to classical information theory that is based on random
variables and communication, and has no bearing on information and randomness
of individual objects. After a brief overview, the major subfields,
applications, history, and a map of the field are presented.",2007-03-06T09:54:47Z
"Directed polymer in a random medium of dimension 1+1 and 1+3: weights
  statistics in the low-temperature phase","We consider the low-temperature $T<T_c$ disorder-dominated phase of the
directed polymer in a random potentiel in dimension 1+1 (where $T_c=\infty$)
and 1+3 (where $T_c<\infty$). To characterize the localization properties of
the polymer of length $L$, we analyse the statistics of the weights $w_L(\vec
r)$ of the last monomer as follows. We numerically compute the probability
distributions $P_1(w)$ of the maximal weight $w_L^{max}= max_{\vec r} [w_L(\vec
r)]$, the probability distribution $\Pi(Y_2)$ of the parameter $Y_2(L)=
\sum_{\vec r} w_L^2(\vec r) $ as well as the average values of the higher order
moments $Y_k(L)= \sum_{\vec r} w_L^k(\vec r)$. We find that there exists a
temperature $T_{gap}<T_c$ such that (i) for $T<T_{gap}$, the distributions
$P_1(w)$ and $\Pi(Y_2)$ present the characteristic Derrida-Flyvbjerg
singularities at $w=1/n$ and $Y_2=1/n$ for $n=1,2..$. In particular, there
exists a temperature-dependent exponent $\mu(T)$ that governs the main
singularities $P_1(w) \sim (1-w)^{\mu(T)-1}$ and $\Pi(Y_2) \sim
(1-Y_2)^{\mu(T)-1}$ as well as the power-law decay of the moments $
\bar{Y_k(i)} \sim 1/k^{\mu(T)}$. The exponent $\mu(T)$ grows from the value
$\mu(T=0)=0$ up to $\mu(T_{gap}) \sim 2$. (ii) for $T_{gap}<T<T_c$, the
distribution $P_1(w)$ vanishes at some value $w_0(T)<1$, and accordingly the
moments $\bar{Y_k(i)}$ decay exponentially as $(w_0(T))^k$ in $k$. The
histograms of spatial correlations also display Derrida-Flyvbjerg singularities
for $T<T_{gap}$. Both below and above $T_{gap}$, the study of typical and
averaged correlations is in full agreement with the droplet scaling theory.",2007-02-06T09:07:55Z
"Grommet: an N-body code for high-resolution simulations of individual
  galaxies","This paper presents a fast, economical particle-multiple-mesh N-body code
optimized for large-N modelling of collisionless dynamical processes, such as
black-hole wandering or bar-halo interactions, occurring within isolated
galaxies. The code has been specially designed to conserve linear momentum.
Despite this, it also has variable softening and an efficient block-timestep
scheme: the force between any pair of particles is calculated using the finest
mesh that encloses them both (respecting Newton's third law) and is updated
only on the longest timestep of the two (which conserves momentum). For
realistic galaxy models with N > 10^6, it is faster than the fastest comparable
momentum-conserving tree code by a factor ranging from ~2 (using single
timesteps) to ~10 (multiple timesteps in a concentrated galaxy).",2007-03-15T19:23:51Z
"General Connectivity Distribution Functions for Growing Networks with
  Preferential Attachment of Fractional Power","We study the general connectivity distribution functions for growing networks
with preferential attachment of fractional power, $\Pi_{i} \propto k^{\alpha}$,
using the Simon's method. We first show that the heart of the previously known
methods of the rate equations for the connectivity distribution functions is
nothing but the Simon's method for word problem. Secondly, we show that the
case of fractional $\alpha$ the $Z$-transformation of the rate equation
provides a fractional differential equation of new type, which coincides with
that for PA with linear power, when $\alpha = 1$. We show that to solve such a
fractional differential equation we need define a transidental function
$\Upsilon (a,s,c;z)$ that we call {\it upsilon function}. Most of all
previously known results are obtained consistently in the frame work of a
unified theory.",2007-02-21T15:43:21Z
Dynamics and superfluidity of an ultracold Fermi gas,"The purpose of this paper is to review some of the dynamic and superfluid

Lattice dynamics and electron-phonon coupling in Sr2RuO4,"The lattice dynamics in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been studied by inelastic neutron
scattering combined with shell-model calculations. The in-plane bond-stretching
modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ exhibit a normal dispersion in contrast to all
electronically doped perovskites studied so far. Evidence for strong electron
phonon coupling is found for c-polarized phonons suggesting a close connection
with the anomalous c-axis charge transport in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.",2007-02-13T10:07:09Z
"Self-Averaging in the Three Dimensional Site Diluted Heisenberg Model at
  the critical point","We study the self-averaging properties of the three dimensional site diluted
Heisenberg model. The Harris criterion \cite{critharris} states that disorder
is irrelevant since the specific heat critical exponent of the pure model is
negative. According with some analytical approaches \cite{harris}, this implies
that the susceptibility should be self-averaging at the critical temperature
($R_\chi=0$). We have checked this theoretical prediction for a large range of
dilution (including strong dilution) at critically and we have found that the
introduction of scaling corrections is crucial in order to obtain
self-averageness in this model. Finally we have computed critical exponents and
cumulants which compare very well with those of the pure model supporting the
Universality predicted by the Harris criterion.",2007-03-30T15:50:50Z
Shape-induced phenomena in the finite size antiferromagnets,"It is of common knowledge that the direction of easy axis in the finite-size
ferromagnetic sample is controlled by its shape. In the present paper we show
that a similar phenomenon should be observed in the compensated
antiferromagnets with strong magnetoelastic coupling. Destressing energy which
originates from the long-range magnetoelastic forces is analogous to
demagnetization energy in ferromagnetic materials and is responsible for the
formation of equilibrium domain structure and anisotropy of macroscopic
magnetic properties. In particular, crystal shape may be a source of additional
uniaxial magnetic anisotropy which removes degeneracy of antiferromagnetic
vector or artificial 4th order anisotropy in the case of a square cross-section
sample. In a special case of antiferromagnetic nanopillars shape-induced
anisotropy can be substantially enhanced due to lattice mismatch with the
substrate. These effects can be detected by the magnetic rotational torque and
antiferromagnetic resonance measurements.",2007-01-25T19:02:18Z
The tail of the contact force distribution in static granular materials,"We numerically study the distribution P(f) of contact forces in frictionless
bead packs, by averaging over the ensemble of all possible force network
configurations. We resort to umbrella sampling to resolve the asymptotic decay
of P(f) for large f, and determine P(f) down to values of order 10^{-45} for
ordered and disordered systems in two and three dimensions. Our findings
unambiguously show that, in the ensemble approach, the force distributions
decay much faster than exponentially: P(f) ~ exp(-f^{\alpha}), with alpha
\approx 2.0 for 2D systems, and alpha \approx 1.7 for 3D systems.",2007-02-22T11:06:44Z
"Coding, Scheduling, and Cooperation in Wireless Sensor Networks","We consider a single-hop data gathering sensor cluster consisting of a set of
sensors that need to transmit data periodically to a base-station. We are
interested in maximizing the lifetime of this network. Even though the setting
of our problem is very simple, it turns out that the solution is far from easy.
The complexity arises from several competing system-level opportunities
available to reduce the energy consumed in radio transmission. First, sensor
data is spatially and temporally correlated. Recent advances in distributed
source-coding allow us to take advantage of these correlations to reduce the
number of transmitted bits, with concomitant savings in energy. Second, it is
also well-known that channel-coding can be used to reduce transmission energy
by increasing transmission time. Finally, sensor nodes are cooperative, unlike
nodes in an ad hoc network that are often modeled as competitive, allowing us
to take full advantage of the first two opportunities for the purpose of
maximizing cluster lifetime. In this paper, we pose the problem of maximizing
lifetime as a max-min optimization problem subject to the constraint of
successful data collection and limited energy supply at each node. By
introducing the notion of instantaneous decoding, we are able to simplify this
optimization problem into a joint scheduling and time allocation problem. We
show that even with our ample simplification, the problem remains NP-hard. We
provide some algorithms, heuristics and insight for various scenarios. Our
chief contribution is to illustrate both the challenges and gains provided by
joint source-channel coding and scheduling.",2007-01-08T16:46:50Z
"Analytical description of stochastic field-line wandering in magnetic
  turbulence","A non-perturbative nonlinear statistical approach is presented to describe
turbulent magnetic systems embedded in a uniform mean magnetic field. A general
formula in the form of an ordinary differential equation for magnetic
field-line wandering (random walk) is derived. By considering the solution of
this equation for different limits several new results are obtained. As an
example, it is demonstrated that the stochastic wandering of magnetic
field-lines in a two-component turbulence model leads to superdiffusive
transport, contrary to an existing diffusive picture. The validity of
quasilinear theory for field-line wandering is discussed, with respect to
different turbulence geometry models, and previous diffusive results are shown
to be deduced in appropriate limits.",2007-03-14T15:55:12Z
"Space Program Language (SPL/SQL) for the Relational Approach of the
  Spatial Databases","In this project we are presenting a grammar which unify the design and
development of spatial databases. In order to make it, we combine nominal and
spatial information, the former is represented by the relational model and
latter by a modification of the same model. The modification lets to represent
spatial data structures (as Quadtrees, Octrees, etc.) in a integrated way. This
grammar is important because with it we can create tools to build systems that
combine spatial-nominal characteristics such as Geographical Information
Systems (GIS), Hypermedia Systems, Computed Aided Design Systems (CAD), and so
on",2007-03-16T00:39:57Z
Suppression of magnetotransport in strongly disordered graphene,"A tight-binding model with randomly fluctuating atomic positions is studied
to discuss the effect of strong disorder in graphene. We employ a
strong-disorder expansion for the transport quantities and find a diffusive
behavior, where the conductivity is decreasing with increasing disorder.
Surprisingly, the magnetic field drops out of the transport quantities in
leading order of this expansion. This signals a strong suppression of
magnetotransport effects for sufficiently strong disorder. This result is
consistent with recent experimental observations by Morozov {\it et al.}",2007-03-23T17:47:38Z
JavaTA: A Logic-based Debugger for Java,"This paper presents a logic based approach to debugging Java programs. In
contrast with traditional debugging we propose a debugging methodology for Java
programs using logical queries on individual execution states and also over the
history of execution. These queries were arrived at by a systematic study of
errors in object-oriented programs in our earlier research. We represent the
salient events during the execution of a Java program by a logic database, and
implement the queries as logic programs. Such an approach allows us to answer a
number of useful and interesting queries about a Java program, such as the
calling sequence that results in a certain outcome, the state of an object at a
particular execution point, etc. Our system also provides the ability to
compose new queries during a debugging session. We believe that logic
programming offers a significant contribution to the art of object-oriented
programs debugging.",2007-01-17T13:48:49Z
"In-plane optical anisotropy due to conduction band electron
  wavefunctions","Photoluminescence measurements were carried out on Be $\delta$-doped
  GaAs/Al$_{0.33}$Ga$_{0.67}$As heterostructure at 1.6 K in magnetic fields
($B$) up to 5 T. Luminescence originating from recombination of a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and photo excited holes localized on Be
acceptors was analyzed. The degree of circular polarization ($\gamma_C$) of the
luminescence from fully occupied Landau levels was determined as a function of
$B$ and the 2DEG concentration, $n_s$. At $B$ constant, $\gamma_C$ decreased
with the increase of $n_s$. Two mechanisms of the $\gamma_C(n_s)$ dependence
are discussed: a) the Stark effect on a photo excited hole bound to Be acceptor
and b) the in-plane anisotropy of the intensity of optical transitions. A
quantitative analysis shows that the influence of the Stark effect on
$\gamma_C$ is negligible in the present experiment. We propose that the
$\gamma_C(n_s)$ dependence results from the $C_{2v}$ symmetry of conduction
band electron wavefunctions and we give qualitative arguments supporting this
interpretation.",2007-03-05T13:52:18Z
"Even-odd effect in Andreev Transport through a Carbon Nanotube Quantum
  Dot","We have measured the current(I)-voltage(V) characteristics of a single-wall
carbon nanotube quantum dot coupled to superconducting source and drain
contacts in the intermediate coupling regime. Whereas the enhanced differential
conductance dI/dV due to the Kondo resonance is observed in the normal state,
this feature around zero bias voltage is absent in the superconducting state.
Nonetheless, a pronounced even-odd effect appears at finite bias in the $dI/dV$
sub-gap structure caused by Andreev reflection. The first-order Andreev peak
appearing around V=\Delta/e is markedly enhanced in gate-voltage regions, in
which the charge state of the quantum dot is odd. This enhancement is explained
by a `hidden' Kondo resonance, pinned to one contact only. A comparison with a
single-impurity Anderson model, which is solved numerically in a slave-boson
meanfield ansatz, yields good agreement with the experiment.",2007-03-02T22:33:56Z
Two-phonon contributions to inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of MgB2,"Two-phonon contributions to meV-resolved inelastic x-ray scattering spectra
of MgB2 at 300K are identified, in good agreement, in both intensity and
energy, with a harmonic calculation using the force constant matrix from
ab-inito LDA calculations. This contribution impacts the determination of the
linewidth of the E2g phonon mode that is so important for the high Tc of this
material. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of peaks
in measurements of phonon dispersion (q>0) due to 2-phonon scattering in a
non-rare-gas solid.",2007-02-02T05:16:33Z
The Mixed State of Charge-Density-Wave in a Ring-Shaped Single Crystals,"Charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition in a ring-shaped crystals,
recently synthesized by Tanda et al. [Nature, 417, 397 (2002)], is studied
based on a mean-field-approximation of Ginzburg-Landau free energy. It is shown
that in a ring-shaped crystals CDW undergoes frustration due to the curvature
(bending) of the ring (geometrical frustration) and, thus, forms a mixed state
analogous to what a type-II superconductor forms under a magnetic field. We
discuss the nature of the phase transition in the ring-CDW in relation to
recent experiments.",2007-03-05T01:06:38Z
"Zero-bias tunneling anomaly in a clean 2D electron gas caused by smooth
  density variations","We show that smooth variations, \delta n({\bf r}), of the local electron
concentration in a clean 2D electron gas give rise to a zero-bias anomaly in
the tunnel density of states, \nu(\omega), even in the absence of scatterers,
and thus, without the Friedel oscillations. The energy width, \omega_0, of the
anomaly scales with the magnitude, \delta n, and characteristic spatial extent,
D, of the fluctuations as (\delta n/D)^{2/3}, while the relative magnitude
\delta\nu/\nu scales as (\delta n/D). With increasing \omega, the averaged
\delta\nu oscillates with \omega. We demonstrate that the origin of the anomaly
is a weak curving of the classical electron trajectories due to the smooth
inhomogeneity of the gas. This curving suppresses the corrections to the
electron self-energy which come from the virtual processes involving two
electron-hole pairs",2007-02-10T08:24:54Z
Orbital order in ZnV$_2$O$_4$,"In view of recent controversy regarding the orbital order in the frustrated
spinel ZnV2O4, we analyze the orbital and magnetic groundstate of this system
within an ab initio density functional theory approach. While LDA+U
calculations in the presence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilize
an A-type staggered orbital order, the consideration of relativistic spin-orbit
effects unquenches the orbital moment and leads to a uniform orbital order with
a net magnetic moment close to the experimental one. Our results show that ab
initio calculations are able to resolve the existing discrepancies in previous
theories and that it is the spin-orbit coupling alongwith electronic
correlations which play a significant role in determining the orbital structure
in these materials.",2007-01-22T17:56:21Z
Extra-Solar Kuiper Belt Dust Disks,"The dust disks observed around mature stars are evidence that plantesimals
are present in these systems on spatial scales that are similar to that of the
asteroids and the KBOs in the Solar System. These dust disks (a.k.a. ``debris
disks'') present a wide range of sizes, morphologies and properties. It is
inferred that their dust mass declines with time as the dust-producing
planetesimals get depleted, and that this decline can be punctuated by large
spikes that are produced as a result of individual collisional events. The lack
of solid state features indicate that, generally, the dust in these disks have
sizes larger than approximately 10 microns, but exceptionally, strong silicate
features in some disks suggest the presence of large quantities of small
grains, thought to be the result of recent collisions. Spatially resolved
observations of debris disks show a diversity of structural features, such as
inner cavities, warps, offsets, brightness asymmetries, spirals, rings and
clumps. There is growing evidence that, in some cases, these structures are the
result of the dynamical perturbations of a massive planet. Our Solar System
also harbors a debris disk and some of its properties resemble those of
extra-solar debris disks. From the cratering record, we can infer that its dust
mass has decayed with time, and that there was at least one major ``spike'' in
the past during the Late Heavy Bombardment. This offers a unique opportunity to
use extra-solar debris disks to shed some light in how the Solar System might
have looked in the past. Similarly, our knowledge of the Solar System is
influencing our understanding of the types of processes which might be at play
in the extra-solar debris disks.",2007-03-15T04:07:54Z
"Stabilizing effect of nuclear quadrupole interaction on the polarization
  of electron-nuclear spin system in a quantum dot","Nuclear quadrupole interaction extends the limits imposed by hyperfine
interaction on the spin coherence of the electron and nuclei in a quantum dot.
The strain-induced nuclear quadrupole interaction suppresses the nuclear spin
flip and makes possible the zero-field dynamic nuclear polarization in
self-organized InP/InGaP quantum dots. The direction of the effective nuclear
magnetic field is fixed in space, thus quenching the magnetic depolarization of
the electron spin in the quantum dot. The quadrupole interaction suppresses the
zero-field electron spin decoherence also for the case of non-polarized nuclei.
These results provide a new vision of the role of the nuclear quadrupole
interaction in nanostructures: it elongates the spin memory of the
electron-nuclear system.",2007-02-01T07:05:54Z
"Conical intersections induced by the Renner effect in polyatomic
  molecules","Characterizing and localizing electronic energy degeneracies is important for
describ-ing and controlling electronic energy flow in molecules. We show, using
topological phase considerations that the Renner effect in polyatomic molecules
with more than 3 nuclei is necessarily accompanied by 'satellite' conical
intersections. In these intersections the non-adiabatic coupling term is on the
average half an integer. We present ab-inito results on the tetra-atomic
radical cation C2H2+ to demonstrate the theory",2007-01-31T12:24:59Z
"Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of band tails in lightly doped
  cuprates","We amend ab initio strongly-correlated band structures by taking into account
the band-tailing phenomenon in doped charge-transfer Mott-Hubbard insulators.
We show that the photoemission from band tails accounts for sharp
""quasi-particle"" peaks, rapid loss of their intensities in some directions of
the Brillouin zone (""Fermi-arcs"") and high-energy ""waterfall"" anomalies as a
consequence of matrix-element effects of disorder-localised states in the
charge-transfer gap of doped cuprates.",2007-02-26T17:08:40Z
"Weak coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer suerconductivity in the
  Electron-Doped Cuprate Superconductors","We use in-plane tunneling spectroscopy to study the temperature dependence of
the local superconducting gap $\Delta(T)$ in electron-doped copper oxides with
various $T_c$'s and Ce-doping concentrations. We show that the temperature
dependence of $\Delta(T)$ follows the expectation of the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity, where
$\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\approx1.72\pm 0.15$ and $\Delta(0)$ is the average
superconducting gap across the Fermi surface, for all the doping levels
investigated. These results suggest that the electron-doped superconducting
copper oxides are weak coupling BCS superconductors.",2007-03-09T17:34:20Z
Charge Ordering in Amorphous WO$_{x}$ Films,"We report on the observation of highly anisotropic viscous electronic
conducting phase in amorphous WO$_{1.55}$ films that occurs below a current
(I)- and frequency (f)- dependent temperature T*(I, f). At T < T*(I, f) the
rotational symmetry of randomly disordered electronic background is broken
leading to the appearance of mutually perpendicular metallic- and
insulating-like states. A rich dynamic behavior of the electronic matter
occurring at T < T*(I, f) provides evidence for an interplay between pinning
effects and electron-electron interactions. The results strongly suggest a
dynamic crystallization of the disordered electronic matter, viz. formation of
sliding Wigner crystal, as well as the occurrence of quantum smectic or stripe
phase in the pinning-dominated regime.",2007-01-11T12:07:47Z
Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory of the Periodic Anderson Model,"We develop a cluster dynamical mean field theory of the periodic Anderson
model in three dimensions, taking a cluster of two sites as a basic reference
frame. The mean field theory displays the basic features of the Doniach phase
diagram: a paramagnetic Fermi liquid state, an antiferromagnetic state and a
transition between them.
  In contrast with spin density wave theories, the transition is accompanied by
a large increase of the effective mass everywhere on the Fermi surface and a
substantial change of the Fermi surface shape across the transition. To
understand the nature and the origin of the phases near the transition, we
investigate the paramagnetic solution underlying the antiferromagnetic state,
and identify the transition as a point where the $f$ electrons decouple from
the conduction electrons undergoing an orbitally selective Mott transition.
This point turns out to be intimately related to the two impurity Kondo model
quantum critical point. In this regime, non local correlations become important
and result in significant changes in the photoemission spectra and the de
Haas-van Alphen frequencies. The transition involves considerable $f$ spectral
weight transfer from the Fermi level to its immediate vicinity, rather than to
the Hubbard bands as in single site DMFT.",2007-02-23T21:07:46Z
"Some exact identities connecting one- and two-particle Green's functions
  in spin-orbit coupling systems","Some exact identities connecting the one- and two-particle Green's functions
in the presence of spin-orbit coupling have been derived. These identities is
similar to the usual Ward identity in the particle or charge transport theory
and a satisfying spin transport theory in spin-orbit coupling system should
also preserve these identities.",2007-01-11T03:17:57Z
"Critical Binder cumulant for isotropic Ising models on square and
  triangular lattices","Using Monte Carlo techniques, the critical Binder cumulant U* of isotropic
nearest-neighbour Ising models on square and triangular lattices is studied.
For rectangular shapes, employing periodic boundary conditions, U* is found to
show the same dependence on the aspect ratio for both lattice types. Similarly,
applying free boundary conditions for systems with square as well as circular
shapes for both lattices, the simulational findings are also consistent with
the suggestion that, for isotropic Ising models with short-range interactions,
U* depends on the shape and the boundary condition, but not on the lattice
structure.",2007-01-22T12:38:13Z
Quantum mechanical motion of off-center ion in external magnetic field,"We consider the magnetostatic response to an external magnetic field of a
crystal containing off-center ions, such as Li^+ in KCl and KBr or the apical
oxygens O(A) in the LaSCO family of layered perovskites. Magnetic dipoles are
deduced from the matrix elements of the energy operator of a spinning particle
in a magnetic field which particle also satisfies the nonlinear Mathieu
equation. The magnetic moments are found to increase in magnitude as the system
goes from the lowest energy ground state to the higher lying excited states.
Our conclusions are in concert with earlier studies of magnetic dipoles from
circular currents based on Ampere's theorem.",2007-02-22T21:07:16Z
"Parallel Self-Consistent-Field Calculations via Chebyshev-Filtered
  Subspace Acceleration","Solving the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem constitutes the most computationally
expensive part in self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
In a previous paper, we have proposed a nonlinear Chebyshev-filtered subspace
iteration method, which avoids computing explicit eigenvectors except at the
first SCF iteration. The method may be viewed as an approach to solve the
original nonlinear Kohn-Sham equation by a nonlinear subspace iteration
technique, without emphasizing the intermediate linearized Kohn-Sham eigenvalue
problem. It reaches self-consistency within a similar number of SCF iterations
as eigensolver-based approaches. However, replacing the standard
diagonalization at each SCF iteration by a Chebyshev subspace filtering step
results in a significant speedup over methods based on standard
diagonalization. Here, we discuss an approach for implementing this method in
multi-processor, parallel environment. Numerical results are presented to show
that the method enables to perform a class of highly challenging DFT
calculations that were not feasible before.",2007-03-09T04:32:24Z
Single-qubit lasing and cooling at the Rabi frequency,"For a superconducting qubit driven to perform Rabi oscillations and coupled
to a slow electromagnetic or nano-mechanical oscillator we describe previously
unexplored quantum optics effects. When the Rabi frequency is tuned to
resonance with the oscillator the latter can be driven far from equilibrium.
Blue detuned driving leads to a population inversion in the qubit and a
bi-stability with lasing behavior of the oscillator; for red detuning the qubit
cools the oscillator. This behavior persists at the symmetry point where the
qubit-oscillator coupling is quadratic and decoherence effects are minimized.
There the system realizes a ""single-atom-two-photon laser"".",2007-01-02T20:22:02Z
The anisotropic XY model on the inhomogeneous periodic chain,"The static and dynamic properties of the anisotropic XY-model $(s=1/2)$ on
the inhomogeneous periodic chain, composed of $N$ cells with $n$ different
exchange interactions and magnetic moments, in a transverse field $h,$ are
determined exactly at arbitrary temperatures. The properties are obtained by
introducing the Jordan-Wigner fermionization and by reducing the problem to a
diagonalization of a finite matrix of $nth$ order. The quantum transitions are
determined exactly by analyzing, as a function of the field, the induced
magnetization $1/n\sum_{m=1}^{n}\mu_{m}\left< S_{j,m}^{z}\right>$ ($j$ denotes
the cell, $m$ the site within the cell, $\mu_{m}$ the magnetic moment at site
$m$ within the cell) and the spontaneous magnetization $1/n\sum_{m=1}^{n}\left<
S_{j,m}^{x},\right>$ which is obtained from the correlations $\left<
S_{j,m}^{x}S_{j+r,m}^{x}\right>$ for large spin separations. These results,
which are obtained for infinite chains, correspond to an extension of the ones
obtained by Tong and Zhong(\textit{Physica B} \textbf{304,}91 (2001)). The
dynamic correlations, $\left<
S_{j,m}^{z}(t)S_{j^{\prime},m^{\prime}}^{z}(0)\right>$, and the dynamic
susceptibility, $\chi_{q}^{zz}(\omega),$ are also obtained at arbitrary
temperatures. Explicit results are presented in the limit T=0, where the
critical behaviour occurs, for the static susceptibility $\chi_{q}^{zz}(0)$ as
a function of the transverse field $h$, and for the frequency dependency of
dynamic susceptibility $\chi_{q}^{zz}(\omega)$.",2007-01-25T19:00:51Z
Coarse-Graining and Scaling in Dissipative Particle Dynamics,"Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is now a well-established method for
simulating soft matter systems. However, its applicability was recently
questioned because some investigations showed an upper coarse-graining limit
that would prevent the applicability of the method to the whole mesoscopic
range. This article aims to reestablish DPD as a truly scale-free method by
analyzing the problems reported by other authors and by presenting a scaling
scheme that allows one to gauge a DPD-simulation to any desired length scale.",2007-03-26T16:33:42Z
"The Representative XMM-Newton Cluster Structure Survey (REXCESS) of an
  X-ray Luminosity Selected Galaxy Cluster Sample","The largest uncertainty for cosmological studies using clusters of galaxies
is introduced by our limited knowledge of the statistics of galaxy cluster
structure, and of the scaling relations between observables and cluster mass.
To improve on this situation we have started an XMM-Newton Large Programme for
the in-depth study of a representative sample of 33 galaxy clusters, selected
in the redshift range z=0.055 to 0.183 from the REFLEX Cluster Survey, having
X-ray luminosities above 0.4 X 10^44 h_70^-2 erg s^-1 in the 0.1 - 2.4 keV
band. This paper introduces the sample, compiles properties of the clusters,
and provides detailed information on the sample selection function. We describe
the selection of a nearby galaxy cluster sample that makes optimal use of the
XMM-Newton field-of-view, and provides nearly homogeneous X-ray luminosity
coverage for the full range from poor clusters to the most massive objects in
the Universe. For the clusters in the sample, X-ray fluxes are derived and
compared to the previously obtained fluxes from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. We
find that the fluxes and the flux errors have been reliably determined in the
ROSAT All-Sky Survey analysis used for the REFLEX Survey. We use the sample
selection function documented in detail in this paper to determine the X-ray
luminosity function, and compare it with the luminosity function of the entire
REFLEX sample. We also discuss morphological peculiarities of some of the
sample members. The sample and some of the background data given in this
introductory paper will be important for the application of these data in the
detailed studies of cluster structure, to appear in forthcoming publications.",2007-03-21T12:26:17Z
Coronal Abundances in Orion Nebula Cluster Stars,"Following the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) observation, we have
studied the chemical composition of the hot plasma in a sample of 146 X-ray
bright pre-main sequence stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We report
measurements of individual element abundances for a subsample of 86
slightly-absorbed and bright X-ray sources, using low resolution X-ray spectra
obtained from the Chandra ACIS instrument. The X-ray emission originates from a
plasma with temperatures and elemental abundances very similar to those of
active coronae in older stars. A clear pattern of abundances vs. First
Ionization Potential (FIP) is evident if solar photospheric abundances are
assumed as reference. The results are validated by extensive simulations. The
observed abundance distributions are compatible with a single pattern of
abundances for all stars, although a weak dependence on flare loop size may be
present. The abundance of calcium is the only one which appears to vary
substantially between stars, but this quantity is affected by relatively large
uncertainties. The ensemble properties of the X-ray bright COUP sources confirm
that the iron in the emitting plasma is underabundant with respect to both the
solar composition and to the average stellar photospheric values. Comparison of
the present plasma abundances with those of the stellar photospheres and those
of the gaseous component of the nebula, indicates a good agreement for all the
other elements with available measurements, and in particular for the high-FIP
elements (Ne, Ar, O, and S) and for the low-FIP element Si. We conclude that
there is evidence of a significant chemical fractionation effect only for iron,
which appears to be depleted by a factor 1.5--3 with respect to the stellar
composition.",2007-03-16T14:33:16Z
"Decoherence of Rabi oscillations of electronic spin states in a double
  quantum dot","We study the role of charge fluctuations in the decoherence of Rabi
oscillations between spin states |$\uparrow \downarrow$>, |$\downarrow
\uparrow$> of two electrons in a double dot structure. We consider the effects
of fluctuations in energy and in the quantum state of the system, both in the
classical and quantum limit. The role of state fluctuations is shown to be of
leading order at sufficiently high temperature, applicable to actual
experiments. At low temperature the low frequency energy fluctuations are the
only dominant contribution.",2007-03-13T16:52:11Z
Rabi oscillations from ultrasound in spin systems,"It is shown that ultrasound in the GHz range can generate space-time Rabi
oscillations between spin states of molecular magnets. We compute dynamics of
the magnetization generated by surface acoustic waves and discuss conditions

Energy and angular momentum densities of stationary gravity fields,"We give physical explanations of explicit invariant expressions for the
energy and angular momentum densities of gravitational fields in stationary
space-times. These expressions involve non-locally defined conformal factors.
In certain coordinates these become locally defined in terms of the metric.
These results are derived via expressions for total gravitational potential
energy from the difference between the total energy and the mechanical energy.
The latter involves kinetic energy seen in the frame of static observers.
  When in the axially symmetric case we consider zero angular momentum
observers (who move orthogonally to surfaces of constant time), we find that
the angular momentum they attribute to the gravitational field is solely due to
their motion.",2007-01-10T14:22:17Z
Semiflexible Polymer Confined in Closed Spaces,"We analyze static properties of a strongly confined semiflexible polymer,
i.e. either trapped in a closed space or compressed by external forces, in an
athermal solvent. Like a flexible polymer case, we can resort to an analogy
with the semidilute solution, but a complication due to the additional length
scale arising from the chain rigidity results in more diverse behaviours
depending on system parameters. For each regime, scaling forms of the excess
free energy of the confinement are derived. Effects of the confinement geometry
and the solvent quality are briefly discussed.",2007-03-13T02:08:52Z
"Quantization of massive scalar fields over axis symmetric space-time
  backgrounds","The renormalized mean value of the quantum Lagrangian and the Energy-Momentum
tensor for scalar fields coupled to an arbitrary gravitational field
configuration are analytically evaluated in the Schwinger-DeWitt approximation,
up to second order in the inverse mass value. The cylindrical symmetry
situation is considered. The results furnish the starting point for
investigating iterative solutions of the back-reaction problem related with the
quantization of cylindrical scalar field configurations. Due to the homogeneity
of the equations of motion of the Klein-Gordon field, the general results are
also valid for performing the quantization over either vanishing or
non-vanishing mean field configurations. As an application, compact analytical
expressions are derived here for the quantum mean Lagrangian and
Energy-Momentum tensor in the particular background given by the Black-String
space-time.",2007-01-24T23:20:40Z
"Dynamic first-order phase transition in kinetically constrained models
  of glasses","We show that the dynamics of kinetically constrained models of glass formers
takes place at a first-order coexistence line between active and inactive
dynamical phases. We prove this by computing the large-deviation functions of
suitable space-time observables, such as the number of configuration changes in
a trajectory. We present analytic results for dynamic facilitated models in a
mean-field approximation, and numerical results for the Fredrickson-Andersen
model, the East model, and constrained lattice gases, in various dimensions.
This dynamical first-order transition is generic in kinetically constrained
models, and we expect it to be present in systems with fully jammed states.",2007-01-30T16:12:56Z
"Paging and Registration in Cellular Networks: Jointly Optimal Policies
  and an Iterative Algorithm","This paper explores optimization of paging and registration policies in
cellular networks. Motion is modeled as a discrete-time Markov process, and
minimization of the discounted, infinite-horizon average cost is addressed. The
structure of jointly optimal paging and registration policies is investigated
through the use of dynamic programming for partially observed Markov processes.
It is shown that there exist policies with a certain simple form that are
jointly optimal, though the dynamic programming approach does not directly
provide an efficient method to find the policies.
  An iterative algorithm for policies with the simple form is proposed and
investigated. The algorithm alternates between paging policy optimization and
registration policy optimization. It finds a pair of individually optimal
policies, but an example is given showing that the policies need not be jointly
optimal. Majorization theory and Riesz's rearrangement inequality are used to
show that jointly optimal paging and registration policies are given for
symmetric or Gaussian random walk models by the nearest-location-first paging
policy and distance threshold registration policies.",2007-02-18T20:51:55Z
Coarse-grained V-representability,"The unsolved problem of determining which densities are ground state
densities of an interacting electron system in some external potential is
important to the foundations of density functional theory. A coarse-grained
version of this ensemble V-representability problem is shown to be thoroughly
tractable. Averaging the density of an interacting electron system over the
cells of a regular partition of space produces a coarse-grained density. It is
proved that every strictly positive coarse-grained density is coarse-grained
ensemble V-representable: there is a unique potential, constant over each cell
of the partition, which has a ground state with the prescribed coarse-grained
density. For a system confined to a box, the (coarse-grained) Lieb [Intl. J.
Quantum Chem. 24, 243 (1983)] functional is also shown to be Gateaux

  dimensional square lattice ising model","The Kramers-Wannier duality is shown to hold for all the even number spin
correlation functions of the two dimensional square lattice Ising model in the
sense that the high temperature $(T>T_{c})$ expressions for these correlation
functions are transformed into the low temperature $(T<T_{c})$ expressions

"Measurement of the pressure dependence of air fluorescence emission
  induced by electrons","The fluorescence detection of ultra high energy (> 10^18 eV) cosmic rays
requires a detailed knowledge of the fluorescence light emission from nitrogen
molecules, which are excited by the cosmic ray shower particles along their
path in the atmosphere. We have made a precise measurement of the fluorescence
light spectrum excited by MeV electrons in dry air. We measured the relative
intensities of 34 fluorescence bands in the wavelength range from 284 to 429 nm
with a high resolution spectrograph. The pressure dependence of the
fluorescence spectrum was also measured from a few hPa up to atmospheric
pressure. Relative intensities and collisional quenching reference pressures
for bands due to transitions from a common upper level were found in agreement
with theoretical expectations. The presence of argon in air was found to have a
negligible effect on the fluorescence yield. We estimated that the systematic
uncertainty on the cosmic ray shower energy due to the pressure dependence of
the fluorescence spectrum is reduced to a level of 1% by the AIRFLY results
presented in this paper.",2007-03-06T22:22:02Z
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov State in Heavy Fermion Superconductors,"The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state is a novel superconducting
state in a strong magnetic field characterized by the formation of Cooper pairs
with nonzero total momentum (k \uparrow, -k+q \downarrow), instead of the
ordinary BCS pairs (k \uparrow, -k \downarrow). A fascinating aspect of the
FFLO state is that it exhibits inhomogeneous superconducting phases with a
spatially oscillating order parameter and spin polarization. The FFLO state has
been of interest in various research fields, not only in superconductors in
solid state physics, but also in neutral Fermion superfluid of ultracold atomic
gases and in color superconductivity in high energy physics. In spite of
extensive studies of various superconductors, there has been no undisputed
experimental verification of the FFLO state, mainly because of the very
stringent conditions required of the superconducting materials. Among several
classes of materials, certain heavy fermion and organic superconductors are
believed to provide conditions that are favorable to the formation of the FFLO
state. This review presents recent experimental and theoretical developments of
the FFLO state mainly in heavy fermion superconductors. In particular we
address the recently discovered quasi-two-dimensional superconductor CeCoIn_5,
which is a strong candidate for the formation of the FFLO state.",2007-02-21T03:22:55Z
NLC-2 graph recognition and isomorphism,"NLC-width is a variant of clique-width with many application in graph
algorithmic. This paper is devoted to graphs of NLC-width two. After giving new
structural properties of the class, we propose a $O(n^2 m)$-time algorithm,
improving Johansson's algorithm \cite{Johansson00}. Moreover, our alogrithm is
simple to understand. The above properties and algorithm allow us to propose a
robust $O(n^2 m)$-time isomorphism algorithm for NLC-2 graphs. As far as we
know, it is the first polynomial-time algorithm.",2007-03-03T06:44:57Z
Properties of Dense Fluid Hydrogen and Helium in Giant Gas Planets,"Equilibrium properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures under thermodynamic
conditions found in the interior of giant gas planets are studied by means of
density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations. Special emphasis is
placed on the molecular-to-atomic transition in the fluid phase of hydrogen in
the presence of helium. Helium has a substantial influence on the stability of
hydrogen molecules. The molecular bond is strengthened and its length is
shortened as a result of the increased localization of the electron charge
around the helium atoms, which leads to more stable hydrogen molecules compared
to pure hydrogen for the same thermodynamic conditions. The {\it ab initio}
treatment of the mixture enables us to investigate the structure of the liquid
and to discuss hydrogen-hydrogen, helium-helium, and hydrogen-helium
correlations on the basis of pair correlation functions.",2007-01-15T00:00:53Z
"A time-dependent density functional theory scheme for efficient
  calculations of dynamic (hyper)polarizabilities","We present an efficient perturbative method to obtain both static and dynamic
polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities of complex electronic systems. This
approach is based on the solution of a frequency dependent Sternheimer
equation, within the formalism of time-dependent density functional theory, and
allows the calculation of the response both in resonance and out of resonance.
Furthermore, the excellent scaling with the number of atoms opens the way to
the investigation of response properties of very large molecular systems. To
demonstrate the capabilities of this method, we implemented it in a real-space
(basis-set free) code, and applied it to benchmark molecules, namely CO, H2O,
and paranitroaniline (PNA). Our results are in agreement with experimental and
previous theoretical studies, and fully validate our approach.",2007-01-25T19:05:59Z
"Andreev bound states and tunneling characteristics of a
  non-centrosymmetric superconductor","The tunneling characteristics of planar junctions between a normal metal and
a non-centrosymmetric superconductor like CePt3Si are examined. It is shown
that the superconducting phase with mixed parity can give rise to
characteristic zero-bias anomalies in certain junction directions. The origin
of these zero-bias anomalies are Andreev bound states at the interface. The
tunneling characteristics for different directions allow to test the structure
of the parity-mixed pairing state.",2007-01-26T10:21:04Z
"Kaon condensate with trapped neutrinos and high-density symmetry energy

found to be generic regardless uncertainties in the nucleon-kaon interactions

important",2007-03-27T14:18:58Z
"Kinetic self-organization of trenched templates for the fabrication of
  versatile ferromagnetic nanowires","We have self-organized versatile magnetic nanowires, ie with variable period
and adjustable magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). First, using the kinetic
roughening of W(110) uniaxial templates of trenches were grown on commercial
Sapphire wafers. Unlike most templates used for self-organization, those have a
variable period, 4-12nm are demonstrated here. Fe deposition then results in
the formation of wires in the trenches. The magnitude of MAE could be
engineered up or down by changing the capping- or underlayer, in turn affecting
the mean superparamagnetic temperature, raised to 175K so far.",2007-01-14T09:19:26Z
"The plasma spectrum effect on acoustic wave amplification by carrier
  drift in semiconductors","The effect of plasma oscillations on acoustic wave amplification by carrier
drift in semiconductors is discussed. A continuum theory is developed on the
basis of hydrodynamical equations for the conduction electrons, the equations
for the elastic vibrations of the crystal, and the Poisson equation. It is
shown that if the plasma frequency is much lower than the reciprocal value of
the electron relaxation time for the scattering on phonons and impurities, the
results are in agreement with available calculations based on the electrical
conductivity - diffusion equation. However, in the opposite case the
amplification factor is orders of magnitude larger compared to the value
predicted by those calculations, while the optimum drift velocity is much
smaller.",2007-02-08T13:15:17Z
Third and fourth degree collisional moments for inelastic Maxwell models,"The third and fourth degree collisional moments for $d$-dimensional inelastic
Maxwell models are exactly evaluated in terms of the velocity moments, with
explicit expressions for the associated eigenvalues and cross coefficients as
functions of the coefficient of normal restitution. The results are applied to
the analysis of the time evolution of the moments (scaled with the thermal
speed) in the free cooling problem. It is observed that the characteristic
relaxation time toward the homogeneous cooling state decreases as the
anisotropy of the corresponding moment increases. In particular, in contrast to
what happens in the one-dimensional case, all the anisotropic moments of degree
equal to or less than four vanish in the homogeneous cooling state for $d\geq
2$.",2007-03-27T09:59:16Z
Injected Power Fluctuations in 1D Dissipative Systems,"Using fermionic techniques, we compute exactly the large deviation function
(ldf) of the time-integrated injected power in several one-dimensional
dissipative systems of classical spins. The dynamics are T=0 Glauber dynamics
supplemented by an injection mechanism, which is taken as a Poissonian flipping
of one particular spin. We discuss the physical content of the results,
specifically the influence of the rate of the Poisson process on the properties
of the ldf.",2007-03-16T09:09:40Z
"Magnetoresistance Oscillations in Two-dimensional Electron Systems
  Induced by AC and DC Fields","We report on magnetotransport measurements in a high-mobility two-dimentional
electron system subject simultaneously to AC (microwave) and DC (Hall) fields.
We find that DC excitation affects microwave photoresistance in a nontrivial
way. Photoresistance maxima (minima) evolve into minima (maxima) and back,
reflecting strong coupling and interplay of AC- and DC-induced effects. Most of
our observations can be explained in terms of indirect electron transitions
using a new, ``combined'' resonant condition. Observed quenching of
microwave-induced zero resistance by a DC field cannot be unambiguously linked
to a domain model, at least until a systematic theory treating both excitation
types within a single framework is developed.",2007-01-29T21:01:50Z
Optimal operation of transition-edge sensors on ballistic membranes,"We calculate the operating parameters of a transition edge sensor that is
mounted on a thin dielectric membrane with the assumption that the phononic
heat transport in the membrane is ballistic. Our treatment uses the correct
phonon modes from elasticity theory (Lamb-modes), and spans the transition from
3D to 2D behavior. The phonon cooling power and conductance have a global
minimum as function of membrane thickness, which leads to an optimal value for
the membrane thickness with respect to noise equivalent power at a fixed
operating temperature. The energy resolution of a calorimeter will not be
affected strongly, but, somewhat counterintuitively, the effective time
constant can be reduced by decreasing the membrane thickness in the 2D limit.",2007-02-23T09:30:32Z
"Natural time and 1/f ""noise""","Seismic electric signals have been found to obey the ubiquitous $1/f^a$
behavior [{\em Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 66}, 011902(2002)]. The newly introduced
concept of natural time enables the study of the dynamic evolution of a complex
system and identifies when the system enters the critical stage. On the basis
of this concept, a simple model is proposed here which exhibits the $1/f^a$
behavior with $a$ close to unity. Furthermore, we present recent data of
electric signals, which when analyzed in the natural time domain are found to
exhibit {\em critical} dynamics and hence can be classified as seismic electric
signals.",2007-03-26T17:36:58Z
A symmetry principle for Topological Quantum Order,"We present a unifying framework to study physical systems which exhibit
topological quantum order (TQO). The guiding principle behind our approach is
that of symmetries and entanglement. We introduce the concept of
low-dimensional Gauge-Like Symmetries (GLSs), and the physical conservation
laws (including topological terms and fractionalization) which emerge from
them. We prove then sufficient conditions for TQO at both zero and finite
temperatures. The topological defects which are associated with the restoration
of GLSs lead to TQO. Selection rules associated with the GLSs enable us to
systematically construct states with TQO; these selection rules do not rely on
the existence of a finite gap between the ground states to all other excited
states. All currently known examples of TQO display GLSs. We analyze spectral
structures and show that Kitaev's toric code model and Wen's plaquette model
are equivalent and reduce, by a duality mapping, to an Ising chain. Despite the
spectral gap in these systems, the toric operator expectation values may vanish
once thermal fluctuations are present. This mapping illustrates that the
quantum states themselves in a particular (operator language) representation
encode TQO and that the duality mappings, being non-local in the original
representation, disentangle the order. We present a general algorithm for the
construction of long-range string orders in general systems with entangled
ground states.",2007-02-16T06:44:42Z
"Insulating charge density wave for a half-filled SU(N) Hubbard model
  with an attractive on-site interaction in one dimension","We study a one-dimensional SU(N) Hubbard model with an attractive on-site
interaction and $N>2$ at half-filling on the bipartite lattice using
density-matrix renormalization-group method and a perturbation theory. We find
that the ground state of the SU(N) Hubbard model is a charge density wave state
with two-fold degeneracy. All the excitations are found to be gapful, resulting
in an insulating ground state, on contrary to that in the SU(2) case. Moreover,
the charge gap is equal to the Cooperon gap, which behaves as $-2Nt^2/(N-1)U$
in the strong coupling regime. However, the spin gap $\Delta_{s}$ and the
quasiparticle gap $\Delta_{1}$ as well open exponentially in the weak coupling
region, while in the strong coupling region, they linearly depend on $U$ such
that $\Delta_{s}\sim -U(N-1)$ and $\Delta_{1}\sim -U(N-1)/2$.",2007-02-26T03:46:31Z
Correlation effects in the transport through quantum dots,"We study the charge and heat transport through the correlated quantum dot
with a finite value of the charging energy U \neq \infty . The Kondo resonance
appearing at temperatures below T_K is responsible for several qualitative
changes of the electric and thermal transport. We show that under such
conditions the semiclassical Mott relation between the thermopower and electric
conductivity is violated. We also analyze the other transport properties where
a finite charging energy U has a significant influence. They are considered
here both, in the limit of small and for arbitrarily large values of the
external voltage eV and/or temperature difference. In particular, we check
validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law and the semiclassical Mott relation.",2007-01-10T17:52:47Z
"Kolmogorov and Kelvin-Wave Cascades of Superfluid Turbulence at T=0:
  What is in Between?","As long as vorticity quantization remains irrelevant for the long-wave
physics, superfluid turbulence supports a regime macroscopically identical to
the Kolmogorov cascade of a normal liquid. At high enough wavenumbers, the
energy flux in the wavelength space is carried by individual Kelvin-wave
cascades on separate vortex lines. We analyze the transformation of the
Kolmogorov cascade into the Kelvin-wave cascade, revealing a chain of three
distinct intermediate cascades, supported by local-induction motion of the
vortex lines, and distinguished by specific reconnection mechanisms. The most
prominent qualitative feature predicted is unavoidable production of vortex
rings of the size of the order of inter-vortex distance.",2007-03-02T02:00:59Z
Graphene-based resonant-tunneling strucures,"Resonant electronic transmission through graphene-based double barriers
(wells) is studied as a function of the incident wave vector, the widths and
heights (depths) of the barriers (wells), and the separation between them.
Resonant features in the transmission result from resonant electron states in
the wells or hole states in the barriers and strongly influence the ballistic
conductance of the structures.",2007-02-26T12:31:42Z
Spectral and Fermi surface properties from Wannier interpolation,"We present an efficient first-principles approach for calculating Fermi
surface averages and spectral properties of solids, and use it to compute the
low-field Hall coefficient of several cubic metals and the magnetic circular
dichroism of iron. The first step is to perform a conventional first-principles
calculation and store the low-lying Bloch functions evaluated on a uniform grid
of k-points in the Brillouin zone. We then map those states onto a set of
maximally-localized Wannier functions, and evaluate the matrix elements of the
Hamiltonian and the other needed operators between the Wannier orbitals, thus
setting up an ``exact tight-binding model.'' In this compact representation the
k-space quantities are evaluated inexpensively using a generalized
Slater-Koster interpolation. Because of the strong localization of the Wannier
orbitals in real space, the smoothness and accuracy of the k-space
interpolation increases rapidly with the number of grid points originally used
to construct the Wannier functions. This allows k-space integrals to be
performed with ab-initio accuracy at low cost. In the Wannier representation,
band gradients, effective masses, and other k-derivatives needed for transport
and optical coefficients can be evaluated analytically, producing numerically
stable results even at band crossings and near weak avoided crossings.",2007-02-23T16:07:14Z
Ricci identities in higher dimensions,"We explore connections between geometrical properties of null congruences and
the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor in n>4 spacetime dimensions. First,
we present the full set of Ricci identities on a suitable ""null"" frame, thus
completing the extension of the Newman-Penrose formalism to higher dimensions.
Then we specialize to geodetic null congruences and study specific consequences
of the Sachs equations. These imply, for example, that Kundt spacetimes are of
type II or more special (like for n=4) and that for odd n a twisting geodetic
WAND must also be shearing (in contrast to the case n=4).",2007-01-27T21:36:26Z
Bayesian Network Tomography and Inference,"The aim of this technical report is to give a short overview of known
techniques for network tomography (introduced in the paper of Vardi (1996)),
extended by a Bayesian approach originating Tebaldi and West (1998). Since the
studies of A.K. Erlang (1878-1929) on telephone networks in the last
millennium, lots of needs are seen in todays applications of networks and
network tomography, so for instance networks are a critical component of the
information structure supporting finance, commerce and even civil and national
defence. An attack on a network can be performed as an intrusion in the network
or as sending a lot of fault information and disturbing the network flow. Such
attacks can be detected by modelling the traffic flows in a network, by
counting the source destination packets and even by measuring counts over time
and by drawing a comparison with this 'time series' for instance.",2007-02-22T09:43:58Z
Metallic conduction and superconductivity in the pseudogap phase,"We analyze the t-J model on a square lattice using bosonic spinons and
fermionic holons for low density x of holes. Spinons are paired into singlets,
which condense below a temperature T*. The condensate evolves out of the Mott
phase - preserving its symmetry. For T > T* holons and spinons are confined (by
gauge forces), so that there is no coherent charge propagation. Metallic
conduction and d-wave superconductivity result from separate,
sublattice-preserving, holon hopping processes which originate below T* from a
coupling with the condensate. A simple effective Hamiltonian describing these
processes is derived and solved. Holons form a charge Fermi liquid, becoming
incoherent (confined) above T*. In the superconductor holons hop as pairs,
reducing kinetic energy. The two-sublattice property is the glue that connects
the three phases; its effect can be seen in various correlation functions. The
theory can account for many features of the cuprate superconductors, including
the origin of two-dimensional metallicity.",2007-01-12T20:26:38Z
"Time-dependent quantum many-body theory of identical bosons in a double
  well: Early time ballistic interferences of fragmented and number entangled
  states","A time-dependent multiconfigurational self-consistent field theory is
presented to describe the many-body dynamics of a gas of identical bosonic
atoms confined to an external trapping potential at zero temperature from first
principles. A set of generalized evolution equations are developed, through the
time-dependent variational principle, which account for the complete and
self-consistent coupling between the expansion coefficients of each
configuration and the underlying one-body wave functions within a restricted
two state Fock space basis that includes the full effects of the condensate's
mean field as well as atomic correlation. The resulting dynamical equations are
a classical Hamiltonian system and, by construction, form a well-defined
initial value problem. They are implemented in an efficient numerical
algorithm. An example is presented, highlighting the generality of the theory,
in which the ballistic expansion of a fragmented condensate ground state is
compared to that of a macroscopic quantum superposition state, taken here to be
a highly entangled number state, upon releasing the external trapping
potential. Strikingly different many-body matter-wave dynamics emerge in each
case, accentuating the role of both atomic correlation and mean-field effects
in the two condensate states.",2007-02-04T05:34:09Z
"Raman Spectrometry, a Unique Tool to Analyze and Classify Ancient
  Ceramics and Glasses","Raman micro/macro-spectroscopy allows for a non-destructive remote analysis:
body and glaze, crystalline and amorphous phases can be identified, including
the nanosized pigments colouring the glaze. Last generation instruments are
portable which allows for examination in museum, on sites, etc. This paper
gives an overview on the potential of Raman spectrometry technique to analyze
ancient ceramics and glasses. Selected glasses as well as glazes of various
porcelains, celadon, faiences and potteries, representative of the different
production technologies used in the Antique, European, Mediterranean, Islamic
and Asian worlds were studied. Their identification is based on the study of
the Raman fingerprint of crystalline and glassy phases. Raman parameters allow
for the classification as a function of composition and/or processing
temperature. Special attention is given to the spectra of amorphous and
coloring phases (pigment).",2007-01-15T20:39:35Z
"Properties of solar polar coronal plumes constrained by Ultraviolet
  Coronagraph Spectrometer data","We investigate the plasma dynamics (outflow speed and turbulence) inside
polar plumes. We compare line profiles (mainly of \ion{O}{6}) observed by the
UVCS instrument on SOHO at the minimum of solar cycle 22-23 with model
calculations. We consider Maxwellian velocity distributions with different
widths in plume and inter-plume regions. Electron densities are assumed to be
enhanced in plumes and to approach inter-plume values with increasing height.
Different combinations of the outflow and turbulence velocity in the plume
regions are considered. We compute line profiles and total intensities of the
\ion{H}{1} Ly$\alpha$ and the \ion{O}{6} doublets. The observed profile shapes
and intensities are reproduced best by a small solar wind speed at low
altitudes in plumes that increases with height to reach ambient inter-plume
values above roughly 3-4 $R_\sun$ combined with a similar variation of the
width of the velocity distribution of the scattering atoms/ions. We also find
that plumes very close to the pole give narrow profiles at heights above 2.5
$R_\sun$, which are not observed. This suggests a tendency for plumes to be
located away from the pole. We find that the inclusion of plumes in the model
computations provides an improved correspondence with the observations and
confirms previous results showing that published UVCS observations in polar
coronal holes can be roughly reproduced without the need for large temperature
anisotropy. The latitude distributions of plumes and magnetic flux
distributions are studied by analyzing data from different instruments on SOHO
and with SOLIS.",2007-03-29T00:37:44Z
Anomalous spin-dependent behaviour of one-dimensional subbands,"We report a new electron interaction effect in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wires.
Using DC-bias spectroscopy, we show that large and abrupt changes occur to the
energies of spin-down (lower energy) states as they populate. The effect is not
observed for spin-up energy states. At B=0, interactions have a pronounced
effect, in the form of the well-known 0.7 Structure. However, our new results
show that interactions strongly affect the energy spectrum at all magnetic
fields, from 0 to 16T, not just in the vicinity of the 0.7 Structure.",2007-02-07T15:33:49Z
Design parameters for a nano-optical Yagi-Uda antenna,"We investigate the possibility of directing optical emissions using a
Yagi-Uda antenna composed of a finite linear array of nanoparticles. The
relevant parameters characterizing the plasma resonances of the nanoparticles
are identified and the interaction between the array elements is formulated
accordingly. It is shown that the directionality of the optical emission can be
observed even in the presence of non-negligible absorption losses in the
nanoparticles. We conclude that a finite array of gold nanorods may be
sufficient for the realization of a working nano-optical Yagi-Uda antenna.",2007-03-23T01:11:20Z

"Resistively shunted Josephson junctions: QFT predictions versus MC

"CO oxidation at Pd(100): A first-principles constrained thermodynamics
  study","The possible formation of oxides or thin oxide films (surface oxides) on late
transition metal surfaces is recently being recognized as an essential
ingredient when aiming to understand catalytic oxidation reactions under
technologically relevant gas phase conditions. Using the CO oxidation at
Pd(100) as example, we investigate the composition and structure of this model
catalyst surface over a wide range of (T,p)-conditions within a multiscale
modeling approach where density-functional theory is linked to thermodynamics.
The results show that under the catalytically most relevant gas phase
conditions a thin surface oxide is the most stable ""phase"" and that the system
is actually very close to a transition between this oxidic state and a reduced
state in form of a CO covered Pd(100) surface.",2007-01-31T11:35:22Z
Non-equilibrium Phase Transitions with Long-Range Interactions,"This review article gives an overview of recent progress in the field of
non-equilibrium phase transitions into absorbing states with long-range
interactions. It focuses on two possible types of long-range interactions. The
first one is to replace nearest-neighbor couplings by unrestricted Levy flights
with a power-law distribution P(r) ~ r^(-d-sigma) controlled by an exponent
sigma. Similarly, the temporal evolution can be modified by introducing waiting
times Dt between subsequent moves which are distributed algebraically as P(Dt)~
(Dt)^(-1-kappa). It turns out that such systems with Levy-distributed
long-range interactions still exhibit a continuous phase transition with
critical exponents varying continuously with sigma and/or kappa in certain
ranges of the parameter space. In a field-theoretical framework such
algebraically distributed long-range interactions can be accounted for by
replacing the differential operators nabla^2 and d/dt with fractional
derivatives nabla^sigma and (d/dt)^kappa. As another possibility, one may
introduce algebraically decaying long-range interactions which cannot exceed
the actual distance to the nearest particle. Such interactions are motivated by
studies of non-equilibrium growth processes and may be interpreted as Levy
flights cut off at the actual distance to the nearest particle. In the
continuum limit such truncated Levy flights can be described to leading order
by terms involving fractional powers of the density field while the
differential operators remain short-ranged.",2007-02-07T11:05:33Z
Random walks and diameter of finite scale-free networks,"Dynamical scalings for the end-to-end distance $R_{ee}$ and the number of
distinct visited nodes $N_v$ of random walks (RWs) on finite scale-free
networks (SFNs) are studied numerically. $\left< R_{ee} \right>$ shows the
dynamical scaling behavior $\left<R_{ee}({\bar \ell},t)\right>=
\bar{\ell}^\alpha (\gamma, N) g(t/\bar{\ell}^z)$, where $\bar{\ell}$ is the
average minimum distance between all possible pairs of nodes in the network,
$N$ is the number of nodes, $\gamma$ is the degree exponent of the SFN and $t$
is the step number of RWs. Especially, $\left<R_{ee}({\bar \ell},t)\right>$ in
the limit $t \to \infty$ satisfies the relation $\left< R_{ee} \right> \sim
\bar{\ell}^\alpha \sim d^\alpha$, where $d$ is the diameter of network with $d
({\bar \ell}) \simeq \ln N$ for $\gamma \ge 3$ or $d ({\bar \ell}) \simeq \ln
\ln N$ for $\gamma < 3$. Based on the scaling relation $\left< R_{ee} \right>$,
we also find that the scaling behavior of the diameter of networks can be
measured very efficiently by using RWs.",2007-01-04T07:43:10Z
"Magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetization reversal in GaMnP
  synthesized by ion implantation and pulsed-laser melting","We report the observation of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and the
determination of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in (100)-oriented
single-crystalline thin film samples of GaMnP with x=0.042. The contributions
to the magnetic anisotropy were determined by measuring the angular- and the
temperature-dependencies of the FMR resonance fields and by superconducting
quantum interference device magnetometry. The largest contribution to the
anisotropy is a uniaxial component perpendicular to the film plane; however, a
negative contribution from cubic anisotropy is also found. Additional in-plane
uniaxial components are observed at low temperatures, which lift the degeneracy
between the in-plane [011] and [01-1] directions as well as between the
in-plane [010] and [001] directions. Near T=5K, the easy magnetization axis is
close to the in-plane [01-1] direction. All anisotropy parameters decrease with
increasing temperature and disappear above the Curie temperature T_C. A
consistent picture of the magnetic anisotropy of ferromagnetic GaMnP emerges
from the FMR and magnetometry data. The latter can be successfully modeled when
both coherent magnetization rotation and magnetic domain nucleation are
considered.",2007-03-23T16:06:19Z
"Asymptotic near nucleus structure of the electron-interaction potential
  in local effective potential theories","In local effective potential theories of electronic structure, the electron
correlations due to the Pauli exclusion principle, Coulomb repulsion, and
correlation-kinetic effects, are all incorporated in the local
electron-interaction potential $v_{ee}({\bf r})$. In previous work, it has been
shown that for spherically symmetric or sphericalized systems, the asymptotic
near nucleus expansion of this potential is $v_{ee}(r) = v_{ee}(0) + \beta r +
O(r^2)$, with $v_{ee}(0)$ being finite. By assuming that the Schr\""odinger and
local effective potential theory wave functions are analytic near the nucleus
of atoms, we prove the following via Quantal density functional theory (Q-DFT):
(i) correlations due to the Pauli principle and Coulomb correlations do not
contribute to the linear structure; (ii) these Pauli and Coulomb correlations
contribute quadratically; (iii) the linear structure is {\em solely} due to
correlation-kinetic effects, the contributions of these effects being
determined analytically. We also derive by application of adiabatic coupling
constant perturbation theory via Q-DFT (iv) the asymptotic near nucleus
expansion of the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham theory exchange $v_x({\bf r})$ and
correlation $v_c({\bf r})$ potentials. These functions also approach the
nucleus linearly with the linear term of $v_x({\bf r})$ being {\em solely} due
to the lowest-order correlation kinetic effects, and the linear term of

contributions. The above conclusions are equally valid for systems of arbitrary
symmetry, provided spherical averages of the properties are employed.",2007-02-25T12:10:25Z
"Quantum spin nematics, dimerization, and deconfined criticality in
  quasi-one dimensional spin-1 magnets","We study theoretically the destruction of spin nematic order due to quantum
fluctuations in quasi-one dimensional spin-1 magnets. If the nematic ordering
is disordered by condensing disclinations then quantum Berry phase effects
induce dimerization in the resulting paramagnet. We develop a theory for a
Landau-forbidden second order transition between the spin nematic and dimerized
states found in recent numerical calculations. Numerical tests of the theory
are suggested.",2007-01-16T04:04:57Z
Vibrational features in inelastic electron tunneling spectra,"A theoretical analysis of inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS)
experiments conducted on molecular junctions are presented, where the second
derivative of the current with respect to voltage is usually plotted as a
function of applied bias. Within the nonperturbative computational scheme,
adequate for arbitrary parameters of the model, we consider the virtual
conduction process in the off-resonance region. Here we study the influence of
few crucial factors on the IETS spectra: the strength of the vibronic coupling,
the phonon energy, and the device working temperature. It was also shown that
weak asymmetry in the IETS signal with respect to bias polarity is obtained as
a result of strongly asymmetric connection with the electrodes.",2007-03-21T19:06:03Z
"Crystal structure, magnetism, and bonding of the hexagonal compounds
  Pd$_{1.63}$Mn$_{0.37}$Si and Pd$_{1.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge related to the Fe$_2$P
  structure","We have used single crystal X-ray diffraction methods to establish the
crystal structures of a compound in the Pd-Mn-Si system and in the Pd-Mn-Ge
system. The title compounds have structures related to the Fe$_2$P structure
type and are ferromagnetic with Curie temperatures above the room temperature.
Density functional electronic structure calculations help to understand the
nature of the local moment ferromagnetism in these compounds. However neither
the electronic structure calculations nor the magnetic measurements provide any
evidence of half-metallic behavior.",2007-03-09T04:34:02Z
"On the Feedback Capacity of Power Constrained Gaussian Noise Channels
  with Memory","For a stationary additive Gaussian-noise channel with a rational noise power
spectrum of a finite-order $L$, we derive two new results for the feedback
capacity under an average channel input power constraint. First, we show that a
very simple feedback-dependent Gauss-Markov source achieves the feedback
capacity, and that Kalman-Bucy filtering is optimal for processing the
feedback. Based on these results, we develop a new method for optimizing the
channel inputs for achieving the Cover-Pombra block-length-$n$ feedback
capacity by using a dynamic programming approach that decomposes the
computation into $n$ sequentially identical optimization problems where each
stage involves optimizing $O(L^2)$ variables. Second, we derive the explicit
maximal information rate for stationary feedback-dependent sources. In general,
evaluating the maximal information rate for stationary sources requires solving
only a few equations by simple non-linear programming. For first-order
autoregressive and/or moving average (ARMA) noise channels, this optimization
admits a closed form maximal information rate formula. The maximal information
rate for stationary sources is a lower bound on the feedback capacity, and it
equals the feedback capacity if the long-standing conjecture, that stationary
sources achieve the feedback capacity, holds.",2007-01-16T19:32:56Z
"Site-selective $^{63}$Cu NMR study of the vortex cores of
  Tl$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$CuO$_{6+δ}$","We report site-selective $^{63}$Cu NMR studies of the vortex core states of
an overdoped Tl$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ with $T_{c}$ = 85 K. We observed
a relatively high density of low-energy quasi-particle excitations at the
vortex cores in a magnetic field of 7.4847 T along the c axis, in contrast to
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$.",2007-02-16T14:45:11Z
"Real-time observation of oxidation and photo-oxidation of rubrene thin
  films by spectroscopic ellipsometry","We follow in real-time and under controlled conditions the oxidation of the
organic semiconductor rubrene grown on SiO_2 using spectroscopic ellipsometry.
We derive the complex dielectric function epsilon_1 + i epsilon_2 for pristine
and oxidized rubrene showing that the oxidation is accompanied by a significant
change of the optical properties, namely the absorption. We observe that
photo-oxidation of rubrene is orders of magnitude faster than oxidation without
illumination. By following different absorption bands (around 2.5eV and 4.0eV
for pristine rubrene and around 4.9eV for oxidized rubrene) we infer that the
observed photo-oxidation of these films involves non-Fickian diffusion
mechanisms.",2007-03-20T16:27:00Z
Vortex Quasi-Crystals,"There seems to be a one to one correspondence between the phases of atomic
and molecular matter (AMOM) and vortex matter (VM) in superconductors.
Crystals, liquids and glasses have been experimentally observed in both AMOM
and VM. However, quasi-crystals also exist in AMOM, thus a new phase of vortex
matter is proposed here: the vortex quasi-crystal. It is argued that vortex
quasi-crystals are stabilized due to boundary and surface energy effects for
samples of special shapes and sizes, and that a phase transition between a
vortex crystal and a vortex quasi-crystal occurs as a function of magnetic
field and temperature as the sample size is reduced.",2007-03-06T16:14:27Z
Flow Equations for the BCS-BEC Crossover,"The functional renormalisation group is used for the BCS-BEC crossover in
gases of ultracold fermionic atoms. In a simple truncation, we see how
universality and an effective theory with composite bosonic di-atom states
emerge. We obtain a unified picture of the whole phase diagram. The flow
reflects different effective physics at different scales. In the BEC limit as
well as near the critical temperature, it describes an interacting bosonic
theory.",2007-01-10T11:56:00Z
Waves at surfactant-laden liquid-liquid crystal interface,"A theoretical study is presented of surface waves at a monomolecular
surfactant film between an isotropic liquid and a nematic liquid crystal for
the case when the surfactant film is in the isotropic two-dimensional fluid
phase and induces homeotropic (normal to the interface) orientation of the
nematic director. The dispersion relation for the surface waves is obtained,
and different surface modes are analyzed with account being taken of the
anchoring induced by the surfactant layer, the curvature energy of the
interface, and the anisotropy of the viscoelastic coefficients. The dispersion
laws for capillary and dilatational surface modes retain structure similar to
that in isotropic systems, but involve anisotropic viscosity coefficients.
Additional modes are related to relaxation of the nematic director field due to
anchoring at the interface. The results can be used to determine different
properties of nematic-surfactant-isotropic interfaces from experimental data on
surface light scattering.",2007-03-26T15:34:49Z
Transport and Percolation Theory in Weighted Networks,"We study the distribution $P(\sigma)$ of the equivalent conductance $\sigma$
for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) weighted resistor networks with
$N$ nodes. Each link has conductance $g\equiv e^{-ax}$, where $x$ is a random
number taken from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and the parameter $a$
represents the strength of the disorder. We provide an iterative fast algorithm
to obtain $P(\sigma)$ and compare it with the traditional algorithm of solving
Kirchhoff equations. We find, both analytically and numerically, that
$P(\sigma)$ for ER networks exhibits two regimes. (i) A low conductance regime
for $\sigma < e^{-ap_c}$ where $p_c=1/\av{k}$ is the critical percolation
threshold of the network and $\av{k}$ is average degree of the network. In this
regime $P(\sigma)$ is independent of $N$ and follows the power law $P(\sigma)
\sim \sigma^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha=1-\av{k}/a$. (ii) A high conductance
regime for $\sigma >e^{-ap_c}$ in which we find that $P(\sigma)$ has strong $N$
dependence and scales as $P(\sigma) \sim f(\sigma,ap_c/N^{1/3})$. For SF
networks with degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\lambda}$, $k_{min} \le k \le
k_{max}$, we find numerically also two regimes, similar to those found for ER
networks.",2007-01-22T17:17:44Z
"Topological aspects of graphene: Dirac fermions and the bulk-edge
  correspondence in magnetic fields","We discuss topological aspects of electronic properties of graphene,
including edge effects, with the tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice and
its extensions to show the following: (i) Appearance of the pairn of massless
Dirac dispersions, which is the origin of anomalous properties including a
peculiar quantum Hall effect (QHE), is not accidental to honeycomb, but is
rather generic for a class of two-dimensional lattices that interpolate between
square and $\pi$-flux lattices. Persistence of the peculiar QHE is interpreted
as a topological stability. (ii) While we have the massless Dirac dispersion
only around E=0, the anomalous QHE associated with the Dirac cone unexpectedly
persists for a wide range of the chemical potential. The range is bounded by
van Hove singularities, at which we predict a transition to the ordinary
fermion behavior acompanied by huge jumps in the QHE with a sign change. (iii)
For edges we establish a coincidence between the quantum Hall effect in the
bulk and the quantum Hall effect for the edge states, which is a manifestation
of the topological bulk-edge correspondence. We have also explicitly shown that
the E=0 edge states in honeycomb in zero magnetic field persist in magnetic
field.",2007-01-18T07:49:53Z
"Retrieval of branching sequences in associative memory model with common
  external input and bias input","We investigate a recurrent neural network model with common external and bias
inputs that can retrieve branching sequences. Retrieval of memory sequences is
one of the most important functions of the brain. A lot of research has been
done on neural networks that process memory sequences. Most of it has focused
on fixed memory sequences. However, many animals can remember and recall
branching sequences. Therefore, we propose an associative memory model that can
retrieve branching sequences. Our model has bias input and common external
input. Kawamura and Okada reported that common external input enables
sequential memory retrieval in an associative memory model with auto- and weak
cross-correlation connections. We show that retrieval processes along branching
sequences are controllable with both the bias input and the common external
input. To analyze the behaviors of our model, we derived the macroscopic
dynamical description as a probability density function. The results obtained
by our theory agree with those obtained by computer simulations.",2007-02-19T05:15:44Z
"Hartree-Fock variational bounds for ground state energy of chargeless
  fermions with finite magnetic moment in presence of a hard core potential:A
  stable ferromagnetic state","We use different types of determinantal Hartree-Fock (HF) wave functions to
calculate variational bounds for the ground state energy of spin-half fermions
in volume V_0, with mass m, electric charge zero, and magnetic moment mu, which
are interacting through long range magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. We find
that at high densities when the average inter particle distance r_0 becomes
small compared to the magnetic length r_m, a ferromagnetic state with
spheroidal occupation function, involving quadrupolar deformation, gives a
lower energy compared to the variational energy for the uniform paramagnetic
state. This HF variational bound to the ground state energy turns out to have a
lower energy than our earlier calculation in which instead of a determinantal
wavefunction we had used a positive semi-definite single particle density
matrix operator whose eigenvalues, having quadrupolar deformation, were allowed
to take any value from 0 to 1. This system is of course still unstable towards
infinite density collapse, but we show here explicitly that a suitable short
range repulsive (hard core) interaction of strength U_0 and range a can stop
this collapse.The existence of a stable high density ferromagnetic state with
spheroidal occupation function is possible as long as the ratio of hard-core
and magnetic dipole coupling constants is not very small compared to 1.",2007-03-21T13:04:27Z
Low-voltage current noise in long quantum SINIS junctions,"The current noise in long SINIS junctions at low temperatures is sensitive to
the population of the sub-gap states which is far from equilibrium even at low
bias voltages. Nonequilibrium distribution establishes due to an interplay
between voltage-driven inter-level Landau-Zener transitions and intra-level
inelastic relaxation. We show that the Fano factor is enhanced drastically,
being proportional to the number of times which particle can fly along the
Andreev trajectory before it escapes from the level due to inelastic
scattering. Combining the dc current and noise measurements one can fully
characterize the non-equilibrium kinetics in SINIS junctions.",2007-03-07T16:14:34Z
"On the physical field generated by rotating masses in Poincare-gauge
  theory of gravity","It is shown that the gauge field in Poincare-gauge theory of gravity consists
in two parts: the translational gauge field (t -field), which is generated by
the energy-momentum current of external fields, and the rotational gauge field
(r -field), which is generated by the sum of the angular and spin momentum
currents of external fields. In connection with this the physical field
generating by rotating masses should exist.",2007-02-01T11:19:03Z
On the Onset of Inflation in Loop Quantum Cosmology,"Using a Liouville measure, similar to the one proposed recently by Gibbons
and Turok, we investigate the probability that single-field inflation with a
polynomial potential can last long enough to solve the shortcomings of the
standard hot big bang model, within the semiclassical regime of loop quantum
cosmology. We conclude that, for such a class of inflationary models and for
natural values of the loop quantum cosmology parameters, a successful
inflationary scenario is highly improbable.",2007-01-31T10:35:28Z
Limits to the analogue Hawking temperature in a Bose-Einstein condensate,"Quasi-one dimensional outflow from a dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensate
reservoir is a promising system for the creation of analogue Hawking radiation.
We use numerical modeling to show that stable sonic horizons exist in such a
system under realistic conditions, taking into account the transverse
dimensions and three-body loss. We find that loss limits the analogue Hawking
temperatures achievable in the hydrodynamic regime, with sodium condensates
allowing the highest temperatures. A condensate of 30,000 atoms, with
transverse confinement frequency omega_perp=6800*2*pi Hz, yields horizon
temperatures of about 20 nK over a period of 50 ms. This is at least four times
higher than for other atoms commonly used for Bose-Einstein condensates.",2007-02-02T11:36:12Z
"The spatially resolved stellar populations of isolated early-type
  galaxies","We present radial stellar population parameters for a subsample of 12
galaxies from the 36 isolated early-type galaxies of Reda et al. Using new
long-slit spectra, central values and radial gradients for the stellar age,
metallicity [Z/H] and alpha-element abundance [E/Fe] are measured. Similarly,
the central stellar population parameters are derived for a further 5 isolated
early-type galaxies using their Lick indices from the literature. On average,
the seventeen isolated galaxies have mean central [Z/H]o and [E/Fe]o of
0.29+/-0.03 and 0.17+/-0.03 respectively and span a wide range of ages from 1.7
to 15 Gyrs. We find that isolated galaxies follow similar scaling relations
between central stellar population parameters and galaxy velocity dispersion to
their counterparts in high density environments. However, we note a tendency
for isolated galaxies to have slightly younger ages, higher [Z/H] and lower
[E/Fe]. Such properties are qualitatively consistent with the expectation of an
extended star formation history for galaxies in lower density environments.
Generally we measure constant age and [E/Fe] radial gradients. We find that the
age gradients anti-correlate with the central galaxy age. Metallicity gradients
range from near zero to strongly negative. For our high mass galaxies
metallicity gradients are shallower with increasing mass. Such behaviour is not
predicted in dissipational collapse models but might be expected in multiple
mergers. The metallicity gradients correlate with the central age and
metallicity, as well as to the age gradients. In conclusion, our stellar
population data for isolated galaxies are more compatible with an extended
merger/accretion history than early dissipative collapse.",2007-03-21T01:38:10Z
"Parameters of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya type weak ferromagnetism for some
  perovskite compounds","Compounds with distorted perovskite structure of the 4-f and 3-d transition
metals with the common formula LnTO3 (where Ln is rare-earth element, T is an
element from the Fe group) are the most multifold binary oxides of these two
groups elements. Wide range of stability for this structure allows the
realization of combinations of the Lanthanides with all the transition metals
except the Nickel. Quite interesting physical phenomena take place in these
oxides like charge and orbital ordering; relatively independent magnetic
lattices of the both metals; particular magnetic structures; high optical
indicators; giant magneto-resistance; peculiar dielectric and ferroelectric
properties etc. We have investigated the magnetic properties of pure ferrites
and chromium-based materials as well as of some mixed type oxides like
HoxTb1-xO3, HoMnxFe1-xO3, HoMnxCr1-xO3 and DyFexCr1-xO3.",2007-01-29T12:11:34Z
"Fabrication of Nano-Gapped Single-Electron Transistors for Transport
  Studies of Individual Single-Molecule Magnets","Three terminal single-electron transistor devices utilizing Al/Al2O3 gate
electrodes were developed for the study of electron transport through
individual single-molecule magnets. The devices were patterned via multiple
layers of optical and electron beam lithography. Electromigration induced
breaking of the nanowires reliably produces 1-3 nm gaps between which the SMM
can be situated. Conductance through a single Mn12(3-thiophenecarboxylate)
displays the coulomb blockade effect with several excitations within +/- 40

Percolation in Hierarchical Scale-Free Nets,"We study the percolation phase transition in hierarchical scale-free nets.
Depending on the method of construction, the nets can be fractal or small-world
(the diameter grows either algebraically or logarithmically with the net size),
assortative or disassortative (a measure of the tendency of like-degree nodes
to be connected to one another), or possess various degrees of clustering. The
percolation phase transition can be analyzed exactly in all these cases, due to
the self-similar structure of the hierarchical nets. We find different types of
criticality, illustrating the crucial effect of other structural properties
besides the scale-free degree distribution of the nets.",2007-03-06T16:00:35Z
"Fabrication, optical characterization and modeling of strained
  core-shell nanowires","Strained nanowires with varying InAs/InP core-shell thicknesses were grown
using Chemical Beam Epitaxy. Microphotoluminescence spectroscopy, performed at
low temperature, was then used to study the optical properties of single wires.
Emission from the InAs core was observed and its dependence on the shell
thickness/core diameter ratio was investigated. We found that it is possible to
tune the emission energy towards 0.8 eV by controlling this ratio. We have
compared the measured energies with calculated energies. Our findings are
consistent with the wires having a hexagonal crystal structure.",2007-01-04T18:48:27Z
"X-ray magnetic circular dichroism characterization of GaN/Ga1-xMnxN
  digital ferromagnetic heterostructure","We have investigated the magnetic properties of a GaN/Ga1-xMnxN (x = 0.1)
digital ferromagnetic heterostructure (DFH) showing ferromagnetic behavior
using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD). The Mn L2,3-edge XAS spectra were similar to those of
Ga1-xMnxN random alloy thin films, indicating a substitutional doping of high
concentration Mn into GaN. From the XMCD measurements, it was revealed that
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic Mn atoms coexisted in the Ga1-xMnxN digital
layers. The ferromagnetic moment per Mn atom estimated from XMCD agreed well
with that estimated from SQUID measurements. From these results, we conclude
that the ferromagnetic behavior of the GaN/Ga1-xMnxN DFH sample arises only
from substitutional Mn2+ ions in the Ga1-xMnxN digital layers and not from
ferromagnetic precipitates. Subtle differences were also found from the XMCD
spectra between the electronic states of the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic
Mn2+ ions.",2007-03-19T09:12:51Z
Infrared spectroscopy of Landau levels in graphene,"We report infrared studies of the Landau level (LL) transitions in single
layer graphene. Our specimens are density tunable and show \textit{in situ}
half-integer quantum Hall plateaus. Infrared transmission is measured in
magnetic fields up to B=18 T at selected LL fillings. Resonances between hole
LLs and electron LLs, as well as resonances between hole and electron LLs are
resolved. Their transition energies are proportional to $\sqrt{B}$ and the
deduced band velocity is $\tilde{c}\approx1.1\times10^6$ m/s. The lack of
precise scaling between different LL transitions indicates considerable
contributions of many-particle effects to the infrared transition energies.",2007-03-30T18:32:06Z
"Scattering approach to current and noise in interacting mesoscopic
  systems","We propose an extension of the Landauer-Buttiker scattering theory to include
effects of interaction in the active region of a mesoscopic conductor
structure. The current expression obtained coincides with those derived by
different methods. A new general expression for the noise is also established.
These expressions are then discussed in the case of strongly sequential
tunneling through a double-barrier resonant tunneling structure.",2007-03-21T12:11:33Z
A new equivalence between fused RSOS and loop models,"We consider the topological theories of cond-mat/0404617 and cond-mat/0610583
and study ground state amplitudes of string net configurations which consist of
large chunks $G$ of (trivalent) regular lattice. We evaluate these amplitudes
in two different ways: first we use the Turaev-Viro prescription to write the
amplitude as a sum over labelings of the faces of $G$, and second we use the
local rules that constrain the amplitude (the $F$-matrix) to resolve subgraphs
in creative ways. In the case of the Doubled Fibonacci theory this second way
allows us to produce loop models. In particular, we show that the hard hexagon
model is equivalent to an anisotropic loop model. Many other interesting
equivalences can presumably be obtained.",2007-01-23T21:23:08Z
Origin of the Superconductivity in the Y-Sr-Ru-O and Y-Sr-Cu-O Systems,"We report on the structural, magnetic, and Raman-scattering studies of double
perovskite structure Sr2Y(Ru1-xCux)O6-d systems made by systematic synthesis
processes with various numbers of doping concentrations and sintering
temperatures. We observed different behaviors resulting from the different
thermal treatments. In particular, superconductivity in Cu-doped Sr2YRuO6 has
been observed only for partially melted ceramic materials. We show that
superconductivity is associated with the 1:2:3 phase (YSr2Cu3Ot), similar to
that of Y-Sr-Cu-O samples sintered at high temperature.",2007-03-22T23:55:17Z
Nanoscale Communication with Brownian Motion,"In this paper, the problem of communicating using chemical messages
propagating using Brownian motion, rather than electromagnetic messages
propagating as waves in free space or along a wire, is considered. This problem
is motivated by nanotechnological and biotechnological applications, where the
energy cost of electromagnetic communication might be prohibitive. Models are
given for communication using particles that propagate with Brownian motion,
and achievable capacity results are given. Under conservative assumptions, it
is shown that rates exceeding one bit per particle are achievable.",2007-03-07T23:27:28Z
"Visibility of a Bose-condensed gas released from an optical lattice at
  finite temperatures","In response to a recent manuscript [cond-mat/0609685] on the analysis of
interference patterns produced by ultracold atoms released from an optical
lattice, we point out that in the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate the
interference pattern can be strongly modified by interaction effects and the
presence of a harmonic trap superimposed on the lattice potential. Our results
show that the visibility of the interference pattern is significant only if a
sizeable condensate fraction is present in the trap.",2007-01-17T19:00:59Z
Collapsing transition of spherical tethered surfaces with many holes,"We investigate a tethered (i.e. fixed connectivity) surface model on
spherical surfaces with many holes by using the canonical Monte Carlo
simulations. Our result in this paper reveals that the model has only a
collapsing transition at finite bending rigidity, where no surface fluctuation
transition can be seen. The first-order collapsing transition separates the
smooth phase from the collapsed phase. Both smooth and collapsed phases are
characterized by Hausdorff dimension H\simeq 2, consequently, the surface
becomes smooth in both phases. The difference between these two phases can be
seen only in the size of surface. This is consistent with the fact that we can
see no surface fluctuation transition at the collapsing transition point. These
two types of transitions are well known to occur at the same transition point
in the conventional surface models defined on the fixed connectivity surfaces
without holes.",2007-01-11T07:56:38Z
Shot noise in carbon nanotube based Fabry-Perot interferometers,"We report on shot noise measurements in carbon nanotube based Fabry-Perot
electronic interferometers. As a consequence of quantum interferences, the
noise power spectral density oscillates as a function of the voltage applied to
the gate electrode. The quantum shot noise theory accounts for the data
quantitatively. It allows to confirm the existence of two nearly degenerate
orbitals. At resonance, the transmission of the nanotube approaches unity, and
the nanotube becomes noiseless, as observed in quantum point contacts. In this
weak backscattering regime, the dependence of the noise on the backscattering
current is found weaker than expected, pointing either to electron-electron
interactions or to weak decoherence.",2007-03-05T15:12:54Z
"Thermodynamic Properties of the Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on a
  Railroad-Trestle Lattice with Asymmetric Leg Interactions","Using an approximation method for eigenvalue distribution functions, we study
the temperature dependence of specific heat of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
model on the asymmetric railroad-trestle lattice. This model contains both the
sawtooth-lattice and Majumdar-Ghosh models as special cases. Making
extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit using finite size data up to 28
spins, it is found that specific heat of the Majumdar-Ghosh model has a
two-peak structure in its temperature dependence and those of systems near the
sawtooth-lattice point have a three-peak structure.",2007-03-10T07:26:45Z
Doppler Resilient Waveforms with Perfect Autocorrelation,"We describe a method of constructing a sequence of phase coded waveforms with
perfect autocorrelation in the presence of Doppler shift. The constituent
waveforms are Golay complementary pairs which have perfect autocorrelation at
zero Doppler but are sensitive to nonzero Doppler shifts. We extend this
construction to multiple dimensions, in particular to radar polarimetry, where
the two dimensions are realized by orthogonal polarizations. Here we determine
a sequence of two-by-two Alamouti matrices where the entries involve Golay
pairs and for which the sum of the matrix-valued ambiguity functions vanish at
small Doppler shifts. The Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence plays a key role in the
construction of Doppler resilient sequences of Golay pairs.",2007-03-12T21:46:04Z

Clausius-Mossotti approximation in the theory of polar materials,"Clausius-Mossotti approximation is extended to describe the measured magnetic
moment of an ellipsoidal sample containing magnetic or nonmagnetic ellipsoidal
inclusions and magnetic or nonmagnetic matrix. The magnetic field in the matrix

also. The equilibrium shape of a pore in a ferromagnetic sample is
investigated. The phenomenon of cavitation in porous ferromagnetic samples is
described. The model is applied to calculate magnetic properties of granular
superconductors. The effective electric conductivity of a sample of a composite
material, containing an arbitrary number of differently ordered distributions
of ellipsoidal inclusions is calculated. Effective conductivity of a composite
material, consisting of fibers of high conductivity and a matrix of low
conductivity is discussed. Concentrated electric field in the vicinity of the
ends of a conductive nanofiber in a composite material is calculated. The high
quantity of this field is of an extreme importance to provide the proper
functioning of monitors, based on conductive nanofibers in dielectric media.",2007-02-08T20:13:20Z
Novel metallic and insulating states at a bent quantum Hall junction,"A non-planar geometry for the quantum Hall (QH) effect is studied, whereby
two quantum Hall (QH) systems are joined at a sharp right angle. When both
facets are at equal filling factor nu the junction hosts a channel with
non-quantized conductance, dependent on nu. The state is metallic at nu = 1/3,
with conductance along the junction increasing as the temperature T drops. At
nu = 1, 2 it is strongly insulating, and at nu = 3, 4 shows only weak T
dependence. Upon applying a dc voltage bias along the junction, the
differential conductance again shows three different behaviors. Hartree
calculations of the dispersion at the junction illustrate possible
explanations, and differences from planar QH structures are highlighted.",2007-01-13T13:21:11Z
"Density dependent exchange contribution to $\partialμ/\partial n$ in
  extrinsic graphene","We calculate $\partial\mu/\partial n$ in extrinsic graphene as a function of
carrier density $n$ at zero temperature by obtaining the electronic self-energy
within the Hartree-Fock approximation. The exchange-driven Dirac-point
logarithmic singularity in the quasiparticle velocity of intrinsic graphene
disappears in the extrinsic case. The calculated renormalized
$\partial\mu/\partial n$ in extrinsic graphene has the same qualitative
$n^{-\frac12}$ density dependence as the inverse bare density of states with a
20% enhancement from the corresponding bare value, a relatively weak effect
compared to the corresponding parabolic-band case.",2007-03-20T01:32:27Z
Superfluidity of Grain Boundaries in Solid Helium-4,"By large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations we show that grain boundaries
in Helium-4 crystals are generically superfluid at low temperature, with a
transition temperature of the order of ~0.5K at the melting pressure;
insulating grain boundaries are found only for special orientations of the
grains. We also find that close vicinity to the melting line is not a necessary
condition for superfluid grain boundaries, and a grain boundary in direct
contact with the superfluid liquid at the melting curve is found to be
mechanically stable and the grain boundary superfluidity observed by Sasaki et
al. [Science 313, 1098 (2006)] is not just a crack filled with superfluid.",2007-02-06T22:52:55Z
Noise-resistant entanglement of strongly interacting spin systems,"We propose and analyze a scheme that makes use of interactions between spins
to protect certain correlated many-body states from decoherence. The method
exploits the finite energy gap of properly designed Hamiltonians to generate a
manifold insensitive to local noise fluctuations. We apply the scheme to
achieve decoherence-resistant generation of many particle GHZ states and show
that it can improve the sensitivity in precision spectroscopy with trapped
ions. Finally we also show that cold atoms in optical lattices interacting via

"On vertex algebra representations of the Schrödinger-Virasoro Lie
  algebra","The Schr\""{o}dinger-Virasoro Lie algebra \mathfrak{sv} is an extension of the
Virasoro Lie algebra by a nilpotent Lie algebra formed with a bosonic current
of weight 3/2 and a bosonic current of weight 1. It is also a natural
infinite-dimensional extension of the Schr\""odinger Lie algebra, which -leaving
aside the invariance under time-translation - has been proved to be a symmetry
algebra for many statistical physics models undergoing a dynamics with
dynamical exponent z=2; it should consequently play a role akin to that of the
Virasoro Lie algebra in two-dimensional equilibrium statistical physics. We
define in this article general Schr\""odinger-Virasoro primary fields by analogy
with conformal field theory, characterized by a 'spin' index and a
(non-relativistic) mass, and construct vertex algebra representations of
\mathfrak{sv} out of a charged symplectic boson and a free boson. We also
compute two- and three-point functions of still conjectural massive fields that
are defined by analytic continuation with respect to a formal parameter.",2007-03-08T15:46:03Z
Ewald sums for Yukawa potentials in quasi-two-dimensional systems,"In this note, we derive Ewald sums for Yukawa potential for three dimensional
systems with two dimensional periodicity. This sums are derived from the Ewald
sums for Yukawa potentials with three dimensional periodicity [G. Salin and
J.-M. Caillol, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 113}, 10459 (2000)] by using the method
proposed by Parry for the Coulomb interactions [D.E. Parry, Surf. Sci. {\bf
49}, 433 (1975); {\bf 54}, 195 (1976)].",2007-01-10T19:16:09Z
Gamma Ray Bursts in the Swift and GLAST Era,"We summarize our model for long-duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) that fits
the redshift (z) distributions measured with Swift and missions before Swift,
and the pre-Swift GRB jet opening-angle distribution inferred from achromatic
breaks in the optical light curves. We find that the comoving rate density of
GRB sources exhibits positive evolution to $z \gtrsim 3$ -- 5, whereas the star
formation rate inferred from measurements of the blue and UV luminosity density
peaks at $z\sim 1$ -- 3. The mean intrinsic beaming factor of GRBs is found to
be $\approx 34$ -- 42, and we predict that the mean GRB optical jet opening
half-angle measured with Swift is $\approx 10^\circ$. We estimate the number of
GRBs per year that GLAST is expected to observe based on ratios of BATSE and
EGRET GRB fluences.",2007-03-29T20:01:49Z
"A Case Study of Sedimentation of Charged Colloids: The Primitive Model
  and the Effective One-Component Approach","Sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium density profiles of suspensions of
charge-stabilized colloids are calculated theoretically and by Monte Carlo
simulation, both for a one-component model of colloidal particles interacting
through pairwise screened-Coulomb repulsions and for a three-component model of
colloids, cations, and anions with unscreened-Coulomb interactions. We focus on
a state point for which experimental measurements are available [C.P. Royall et
al., J. Phys.: Cond. Matt. {\bf 17}, 2315 (2005)]. Despite the apparently
different picture that emerges from the one- and three-component model
(repelling colloids pushing each other to high altitude in the former, versus a
self-generated electric field that pushes the colloids up in the latter), we
find similar colloidal density profiles for both models from theory as well as
simulation, thereby suggesting that these pictures represent different view
points of the same phenomenon. The sedimentation profiles obtained from an
effective one-component model by MC simulations and theory, together with MC
simulations of the multi-component primitive model are consistent among
themselves, but differ quantitatively from the results of a theoretical
multi-component description at the Poisson-Boltzmann level. We find that for
small and moderate colloid charge the Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives profiles
in excellent agreement with the effective one-component theory if a smaller
effective charge is used. We attribute this discrepancy to the poor treatment
of correlations in the Poisson-Boltzmann theory.",2007-02-16T10:22:58Z
"Negative magnetic susceptibility and nonequivalent ensembles for the
  mean-field $φ^4$ spin model","We calculate the thermodynamic entropy of the mean-field $\phi^4$ spin model
in the microcanonical ensemble as a function of the energy and magnetization of
the model. The entropy and its derivative are obtained from the theory of large
deviations, as well as from Rugh's microcanonical formalism, which is
implemented by computing averages of suitable observables in microcanonical
molecular dynamics simulations. Our main finding is that the entropy is a
concave function of the energy for all values of the magnetization, but is
nonconcave as a function of the magnetization for some values of the energy.
This last property implies that the magnetic susceptibility of the model can be
negative when calculated microcanonically for fixed values of the energy and
magnetization. This provides a magnetization analog of negative heat
capacities, which are well-known to be associated in general with the
nonequivalence of the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Here, the two
ensembles that are nonequivalent are the microcanonical ensemble in which the
energy and magnetization are held fixed and the canonical ensemble in which the
energy and magnetization are fixed only on average by fixing the temperature
and magnetic field.",2007-02-01T11:06:41Z
Hyperfine Interaction in USb2 Crystal,"The hyperfine interactions at the uranium site in the antiferromagnetic USb2
compound were calculated within the density functional theory (DFT) employing
augmented plane wave plus local orbital (APW+lo) method. We investigated the
dependence of the nuclear quadruple interaction to the magnetic structure in
USb2 compound. The result shows that the 5f-electrons have the tendency to be
hybridized with the conduction electrons.",2007-01-23T18:12:49Z
"Field-Driven Hysteresis of the d=3 Ising Spin Glass: Hard-Spin
  Mean-Field Theory","Hysteresis loops are obtained in the Ising spin-glass phase in d=3, using
frustration-conserving hard-spin mean-field theory. The system is driven by a
time-dependent random magnetic field H_Q that is conjugate to the spin-glass
order Q, yielding a field-driven first-order phase transition through the
spin-glass phase. The hysteresis loop area A of the Q-H_Q curve scales with
respect to the sweep rate h of magnetic field as A-A_0 = h^b. In the spin-glass
and random-bond ferromagnetic phases, the sweep-rate scaling exponent b changes
with temperature T, but appears not to change with antiferromagnetic bond
concentration p. By contrast, in the pure ferromagnetic phase, b does not
depend on T and has a sharply different value than in the two other phases.",2007-03-18T14:12:24Z
"Enskog Theory for Polydisperse Granular Mixtures II. Sonine Polynomial
  Approximation","The linear integral equations defining the Navier-Stokes (NS) transport
coefficients for polydisperse granular mixtures of smooth inelastic hard disks
or spheres are solved by using the leading terms in a Sonine polynomial
expansion. Explicit expressions for all the NS transport coefficients are given
in terms of the sizes, masses, compositions, density and restitution
coefficients. In addition, the cooling rate is also evaluated to first order in
the gradients. The results hold for arbitrary degree of inelasticity and are
not limited to specific values of the parameters of the mixture. Finally, a
detailed comparison between the derivation of the current theory and previous
theories for mixtures is made, with attention paid to the implication of the
various treatments employed to date.",2007-02-05T16:42:00Z
